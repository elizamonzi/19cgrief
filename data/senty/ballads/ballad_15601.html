He had some Days before said to a Minister<br>whom he met with on the Street of Edinburgh, that in partaking of the blessed Sacra-<br>ment he had eaten and drunken unworthily, and consequently brought Damnation on<br>himself. This despondent Temper he was in, kept him from exercising himself so much,<br>in Prayer as became one in his Circumstances, and from being so desirous as he ought<br>to have been of the Prayers of others, which he did not desire, till it was proposed to<br>him whether he would have them pray for him.<p>Being asked if he was sensible of the Evil of that heinous Sin he was guilty of, and<br>the Danger he was in ; he answered, That he had some Sense of it, and Sorrow for it,<br>but not to that Degree that were to be wished, and that he had a stonny and obdur'd<br>Heart.<p>One of the Ministers present, at his Desire, pray'd for him: About the Middle of<br>the Prayer, when some Petitions were put up, That God might grant him a Sense of<br>his Sin, That of His infinite Mercy He would vouchsafe him Grace to Repent, and have<br>Recourse to the Merits and Mediation of our blessed Saviour, and that God, of His in-<br>finite Mercy, for Christ's Sake, would have Mercy on this monstrous Sinner ; while<br>these Petitions were a putting up, and all the while till Prayer was ended, he seem'd<br>more than ordinarly concern'd, and discover'd a greater Concern for his eternal State than<br>had been observed before.<p>After he had been often asked what prompted him to so monstrous a Crime, he<br>could give no tolerable Account of it; but when he was pressed a little on this Head,<br>he said before many Witnesses, That the Predestinarian Principles had led him into it.<br>And being ask'd where he learned these Principles, he said from a Book he had out of<br>the College Library. And being ask'd what Book that was, he answered, one of Flavel's.<br>He desir'd one that was present to take care of his Books, and conceal his Papers, for he<br>said there were many foolish Things in them.<p>He imagin'd that he was to be hung in Chains, and shew'd some Concern on that Ac-<br>count.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  <p>He pray'd the Parents of the murdered Children to forgive him, which they very<br>Christianly consented to. He was always of a reserv'dand melancholly Disposition.<p>At the Sight of the bloody Cloaths in which the Children were murder'd, which were<br>brought to him in the Prison a little before he went to the Place of Execution, he was<br>much affected, and broke out into Groans and Tears.<p>When he came to the Place of Execution the Ministers pray'd for him, and he also Pray'd<br>himself but with a low Voice. He own'd that he had Four Times attempted to de-<br>bauch the Servant Woman he was blam'd with, but that he was not actually guilty with<br>her, and declared he design'd to have married her. Both his Hands were struck off by the<br>Executioner, and he afterwards hanged ; while he was hanging, the Wound he gave him-<br>self in the Throat with the Penknife when he WAS apprehended broke out afresh, and<br>the Blood gushed out in great Abundance.</p>
