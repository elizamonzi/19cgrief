' This is an awfu'<br>condition for me to be brocht till.'?' It is,<br>Dobie.' was the the reply.?to which he rejoined,<br>' Weel : ? I'm as innocent as the child that's <br>a born :' Thomson said nothing. Both the<br>men were rather meanly, but decently and<br>cleanly dressed : and had the usual appear-<br>ance of carters in their Sunday clothes that<br>had already b-en well worn. Both are of slen-<br>der but. athletic make ? Thomson about 5 ft.<br>10 in. high.<p>The declarations emitted by the  prisonars<br>were of great length, and chiefly consisted&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of<br>rambling, inconsistent, and unimportant stale.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ments.<p>Colin Pentland and his wife were called to<p>prove the accidental meeting of the deceased<p>  and the prisoners at their house on the night<p>of the 17th of April, and their subsequent de-<p>parture together, with the carts for Gilmerton.<p>Walter Dingwall, residing at Gilmerton, was<br>called to prove that Thomson's horse had<br>brought his cart into the village of Gilmerton<br>without his master. This witness, and the<br>wife of one Bamherry, a slater in Gilmerton,<br>and others found the shawl of the deaeased,<br>her bundle of bread, &c., in Thomson s cart.<p>Alexander Denham and a young man named<br>Wright, and others in consequence of Thom-<br>son being missing, set off on the road to Edin-<br>burgh in search of him. On their return, they<br>were attracted by the groans of the deceased<br>to the spot where she was lying, near the<br>third milestone ; and finding her to be in a<br>very deplorable state, they carried her to the<br>house of Bamberry, into which she was hu-<br>manely received. In mean time, a person<br>had met Thomson coming into the village, and<br>had said to him, from the circumstance of the<br>shawl being found in the cart, ' You have had<br>a woman with you to-night.' To which he<br>replied, 'Yes, she's juist belrin me.'<p>Drs Renton and Morrison, of Dalkeilh,<br>proved the frightful nature of the injuries in-<br>flicted on the deceased, - her extreme suffer-<br>ings,?her death in consequence of those in-<br>juries,? the appearances of the truly horrid<br>and shocking lacerations and wounds and the<br>consequent mortification, after death,? and<br>also the finding of the stones, &c. within the<br>body of the ill-fated woman.?The same Gen-<br>tlemen also, and other witnesses proved that<br>the deceased had declared, while in the pros-<br>pect of death, that both the prisoners had<br>committed the crimes to which she fell a \ill\<p>Several witnesses from Greenend and other<br>places proved that the prisoners had made<br>their treatment of the deceased a subject of<br>ribald jest and boasting to their companions,<p>The tin box, belonging to the deceased was<br>traced to the possession of Dobie ; and her<br>handkerchief was taken from Thomson's<br>pocket, when he was apprehended.<p>The Lord justice Clerk, in discharging the<br>Jury, stated that the verdict which they had<br>returned was perfectly consonant with the<br>opinions entertained by the Court. Sentence<br>was then moved for.<p>Lord Meadowbank?My Lord Justice<br>Clerk?It is little more than eighteen months<br>ago that the melancholy duty devolved on me<br>to propose sentence of death on a pannel con-<br>vi ted before you of a crime at that time con-<br>sidered almost unparalleled in atrocity. The<br>utmost stretch of our imagination then did not<br>lead us to anticipate the psosibility, that there<br>were living in the midst of civilized society men<br>who could be guilty of still greater atrocities<br>?of more unparalleled brutality?revolting<br>to every feeling that actuates the mind of man.<br>I am perfectly certain that, were the details<br>of this case unfortunately made public, as,<br>thank God, the power of the law has enabled<br>you to prevent, those details would have ex<br>cited such feelings in this Christian communi-<br>ty as never were before excited. It is hardly<br>possible to imagine that persons would have<br>been found living in this Christian land who<br>could have brought their minds to the com-<br>mision of such atrocious crimes Melancholy<br>it is to think that, had this unprotected female<br>been wandering the world amongst the most<br>barbarous people, she would have been in a<br>state of comparative safety to what she was<br>within three miles of the metropolis of this<br>most civilized country ; such is the fact that<p>this poor unhappy woman, after having fallen<br>into the hands of these abandoned men, was<br>treated in a manner which, of necessity, was<br>to produce death ?she was robbed of the mis-<br>erable pittance which she had in her posses<br>sion ; and this was committed on a person on<br>whom they had the intention to satisfy other<br>brutal passions. This is the worst feature of<br>the case. 1 have not words to express the<br>feelings which the detail* of this day have<br>necessarily excited in my bosom. I have al-<br>luded to them generally, and shall only far-<br>ther allude to them by saying, that I think it<br>was impossible for any human being, who<br>heard the evidence, to entertain a doubt of<br>the perfect propriety of the verdict which has<br>been returned. With these observations, I<br>have now simply to propose to your Lordship<br>to pronounce the sentence of the law, which<br>is that of death, and that it shall be carried<br>into effect on Wednesday the 18th of August<br>nest.<p>The Lord Justice Clerk?John Thomson<br>and David Dobie, you have heard the verdict<br>which has been recorded, and the opinions<br>which their lordships entertain in regard to<br>your case as exhibited in evidence against you ;<br>and following their example, ? feeling that no<br>words which I can use are capable of descris-<br>ing the unparalleled brutality, cruelty, and<br>wickedness, of the foul transaction which has<br>been disclosed this day. I shall not enter into<br>details farther than to remark that the exhi-<br>bition you have made is calculated to make<br>every man blush. Such wickedness and brutal<br>abomination could not have been believed to<br>have been committed, had it not been sworn<br>to in evidence. Following the principle of law,<br>by which the proceedings ha\ill\e been conduct-<br>ed with closed doors till this stage of the pro-<br>ceedings, I shall refrain from saying any thing<br>of the crimes of which you stand convicted on<br>the clearest evidence ever produced before a<br>jury. But it is my duty to warn you to pre-<br>pare for the inevitable fate which awaits you<br>in this world : and I warn you, in the most<br>earnest manner, to prepare to appear before<br>the judgment seat of the Almighty, to answer<br>for all the deed, done in the body. Rest as-<br>sured that if ever there was a case in which<br>the law will take it, full course it is yours.<br>You are now to consider that your days on<br>earth are numbered, and that you have no v<br>no other duty in the world but to pray Cor<br>forgiveness of all your elines?to humb'e<br>yourselves at the footstoal of your Creator.<br>Do not lose a single moment in setting about<br>heartfelt repentance?and God grant that it<br>may be sincere,?-and that forgiveness be ex-<br>tended to you for your crimes. His Lordship<br>then sentenced the pannels to be executed at<br>\ill\ dinburgh. on the 18th August and their.<br>bodies given to Dr Monro, professor of ana-<br>tomy, for dissection.<p>Dobie addressed the Lord Justice Clerk in<br>in these words,  My Lord. I have one thing to<br>say, if you please. ?They cannot dissed the<p>soul."<p>On the way from the Court to the Lock<br>up hou e. both the prisoners maintained the<br>same appearance AS they had done throughout<br>the trial ?that is to say, there was a restless<br>recklessness in Dobie's movements and in the<br>expression of his counteaance. while Thomson<br>was collected, silent, and seemingly quite<br>passive in the hands of \ill\ conductors. There<br>was, however, an occasional quivering of his<br>person, an i a solemn tionghtful expression<br>on his pallid coantenarece, which indicated<br>that he felt more than he wished should be<br>observed by the spectators.<p>Until the evidence had been all gone<br>through, Dobie indulged a hope of being ac-<br>quitted ; for he had adooted means for secur-<br>ing, as he thought, evidence in his favour.<br>While he was in the jail, he wrote a latter to<br>one of his cousins, a fenale residing in G.I-<br>merton. instrucing her to swear that she had<br>seen Thomson give him the tin box belonging<br>to Margaret Paterson : and this would have<br>accounted for one of he stronger. \ill\ circun-<br>stances against him. The letter, however,<br>never reached the handsof the woman. It was<br>intercepted, and given to the Sheriff, who<br>sent for the female, am by an interrogatory<br>ascertained that this was an attempt to suborn<br>a witness, and consequently frustrated it. it<br>was perhaps for the same reason that several<p>persons from Gilmerton, who were in the list<br>of witnesses, were not Called to give their<br>evidence for the Crown, as it was probable,<br>from their intimacy with the prisoners, and<br>other circumstances, that Dobie might have<br>been, tampering with them also.<p>In the Lock-up house, Dobie said that<br>some of the witnesses had sworn falsely; but<br>this was chiefly in reference to the amount of<br>silver that the poor murdrred woman had had<br>in her possession.<p>At seven o'clock in the morning, the pri-<br>soners were placed in the usual carriage to<br>be conveyed back to the jail, After they had<br>taken their seats, a tear or two were observed<br>in the eyes of Thomson. Dobie wept plenti-<br>fully, and lamented for his wife and children.<br>(He had sent a sixpence to his wife while the<br>trial was going on, the day before, by one of<br>the witnesses. )?Thomson soon assumed his<br>usual appearance of indifference. He fre.<br>quently looked at the people through the car-<br>riage, and remarked that it was ' a tine morn-<br>ing<p>When they got into the condemned cell,<br>Dobie said to Thomson, If the woman had<br>been in my cairt, Jock, \ill\ ething o' this wud<br>hae happened. The woman was a murdered<br>woman, ?there's nae doot o' that ! But hoo<br>thae, stanes an' hay an' things cam' a boot,<br>(he added with an oath) I dinna ken.' Thom-<br>son made no answer to all this, which must<br>be regarded as a confession by Dobie that he<br>was concerned in the croaes, though not in<br>the worst of them ; and Thomson's silence<br>was a still stronger though tacit admission of<br>the full measure of his \ill\ guilt.?particularly<br>as neither of the prisoners made one single<br>complaint of the justice of their sentence.<br>Dobie spoke often of his wife and children,<br>for whom he lamcnted the disgrace he had<br>brought on them, and he expressed his hope<br>that his mother and his wife would be admit-<br>ted to see him Thomson never once opened<br>his mouth Dobie put an end to the scene.<br>by saying, ' Come, bring as thae class (mean-<br>ing the prison dress;) \ill\ let's pit aft thir<br>yins.' The behaviour of the men, since, has<br>been firm, and becoming their situation.<p>The Gilmerton \ill\--Dobie and Thom-<br>son are now confined in the same cell, and are<br>attended by the Rev. Dr Lee. Since their<br>condemnation they have been very quiet, not<br>a word of reflection, bus proceeded from one<br>against the other. They are bath compara-<br>tively illiterate and ignorant. Dobie can read<br>and write, and Thomson is able to read, but<br>i: would appear they have derived little or no<br>advantage from these acquirements.<p>The awful nature of his situation, from the<br>\ill\, male a deep impression on Thomson's<br>mind Since he was indicted he has been very<br>dull ;  and has become spire in his person.?<br>His coedemnation has had a still greater effect<br>on his spirits, as he appears at times quite ab-<br>stracted and lost in meditation, while at other<br>times he is restless and un easy.? Obserrer.<p>TRIAL OF&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;D. BERTIE.<p>The Indictment, after commencing in the<br>usual ferm, set forth That albeit, by the laws<br>of this and every other well governed realm,<br>Rape is a crime of an heinous nature and<br>severely punishable : yet, true it was and of<br>verity, that David Bertie, the prisoner at the<br>bar, was guilty of the same, he having, on the<br>10 th day of May last, in a house situated in<br>East Cumberland-street, then in the occupa-<br>tion of Mrs Jane Skirving, and in a room in<br>the said house, which he (the prisoner) occu-<br>pied as a lodger, wickedly solicited Margaret<br>Gray, servant to the siad Jane Skirving, and<br>on her rejecting his solicitations, did attack<br>her with force and violence in the said room,<br>? and that on the said Margaret Gray getting<br>away from him, he did some time afterwards<br>in the passage of the said house, again attack<br>the -aid Margaret Gray, and did seize her by<br>the arm and forcibly drag her back into his<br>room. wherein, in spite of all the resistance in<br>her power, he consummated the crime, with<br>great force and violence?[and the particulars<br>of which, as stated in the indictment, are until<br>for publication.]<p>The indictment then went on to state, that<br>the pannel, having been apprehended, and<br>taken before the Sheriff substitute, had emit-<p>ted before him; on the 11th and 13th of May<p>two several declarations which being to be<br>used in evidence against him, had been lodged<br>in; the usual place for his inspection, as also a<br>medical certificate signed by Dr Thatcher,<br>and another medical certificate, signed by Dr<br>Black, surgeon to the Police Establishment,<br>and by Mr A. L. Black, and Mr Sidey, sur-<br>geons,? and also one other article, which.<br>though it was named in the indictment and<br>produced on the trial, it would be improper<br>to mention here.<p>The trial commenced about twelve o'clock ;<br>and the prisoner having been placed at the<br>bar, pleaded Not Guilty.<p>The Examination of Margaret Gray (who is<br>not more than fourteen years of age, and who<br>is a daughter of very decent parents at Joppa,<br>where her father is a mason) occupied two<br>hours and a quarter. She underwent a long<br>and very minute cross-examination; but she<br>was not materially shaken in her principal<br>evidence.<p>There were twenty witnesses in all, for the<br>Crown, amongst whom were, Margaret Gray,<br>Mrs Skirving, Catherine Johnston, Ann Gray,<br>the Medical Gentlemen mentioned in the<br>indictment, Lieutenant Harvey, and Serjeant<br>Charles Stewart, jun , of the Police Establish-<br>ment.<p>The alleged facts of the case were, that on<br>the day libelled, the pri-soner and Margaret<br>Gray being alone, in Mrs Skirving's house, in<br>the absence of Mrs S., and the rest of the fa-<br>mily, the prisoner offered the poor girl first<br>one pound note, then two pound notes, and<br>then three pound notes, if she would comply<br>with his wishes. These temptations having<br>been rejected by the girl, the pannel, as al-<br>leged, next proceeded to use violence in the<br>way libelled in the indictment. After the com-<br>mission of the crime, he had left the house ;<br>but he returned to it again, and was in bed<br>when he was apprehended, about eleven<br>o'clock on the same night. He has all along-<br>positively denied the crime.<p>The prisoner is a young man about twenty<br>eight years of age, dark complexion, roman<br>nose, short stature, and of gentlemanly dress<br>and appearance. He was Clerk to a Writer<br>in Edinburgh. He came from Brechin.<p>The exculpatory evidence occupied a very<br>considerab e portion of time, and there were<br>several very respectable witnesses to the cha-<br>racter of the pannel.<p>The Lord Justice Clerk having made a long<br>and able summing up of the evidence, the<br>Jury retired to consider of their verdict.<p>During theabsence of the jury, the pannel<br>remained in a state of the utmost agitation<br>and anxiety. He repeatedly gazed round<br>him with an indescribably haggard expression<br>on his countenance, over which hung a cloud<br>of the blackest gloom and most dismal melan-<br>choly. At times he laid his head down on<br>his hands and arms ; and for a few moments<br>seemed a leep ; and then he would raise his<br>head again with the same unaltered expres-<br>sion. It struck almost every person in Court<br>that his app arance now was like that of a<br>maniac, or rather of a drunk man, amusing<br>from sleep and trying to collect his dissipated<br>ideas.<br>After an absence of about twenty minutes,<br>the jury return e i at e'even o'clock at night<br>and pronounced by their C/ anc For the \ill\<br>lowing verdict :? My Lords : Owing to the<br>contrad ctory statement of the evidence, we<br>find the charge Not Proven.'<p>On hearing these joyful word, the prisoner-<br>sprung to his feet clapped his hands, attered<br>an exclamation of gratitude to the jury. and<br>(all in an instant) appeared us if he wished<br>to seize his hat, and bound at once out of<br>the Court..<p>Persons who shook the prisoner by the hand,<br>state that it felt like the clammy hand of a<br>person newly dead, or dying.<p>Mary Taylor or Leslie, and George Leslie,<br>were accused of stealing a watch. Mary Tay-<br>lor guilty of the theft, and George Leslie<br>guilty of reset.<p>The female prisoner was sentenced to seven<br>years transportation, and the man to eighteen<br>months confinement in Bridewell.<p>Forbes and Oven, Printers. - [Price One Penny.]</p>
