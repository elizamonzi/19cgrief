	<h2>Transcription</h2>
	<p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A full and true account of the Behaviour and<p> Execution<p>OF<p>MARGARET WISHART, who was Executed at Forfar, on<br>Saturday last, the 16th June, 1827, for the horrid and cruel<br>murder of her own blind sister.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With the proceedings at the<br>place of Execution.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Also an accouut of the dreadful noises <br>which were heard in the house lately occupied by her.<p>FORFAR, 16th JUNE. 1827- This day, the last sentence of the law was put<br>in force here, upon MARGARET WISHART, who was convicted at last Perth<br>Assizes, of the cruel and horrid murder of her own blind sister, by giving her poison<br>among her porridge.<p>It appeared from the evidence which was adduced on the trial, that her sister was<br>blind, and that she lived with Margaret, that she had had an illegitimate child, and<br>was again pregnant; that on the 6th day of October last, she had given her a plate<br>of porridge, and had put some arsenic in them, that in about half an hour after<br>wards she took unwell, and complained of a  particular drought. She was delivered<br>of a male child, which was  healthy as birth, but its belly swelled, and it grew worse<br>till it died. Her sister Margaret, would let no doctors be sent for, and she died in<br>three days after she got the poison.<p>The Jury unanimously found her guilty of the murder of her sister, and she was to<br>have been Executed here, on Saturday the 2d of June, but in consequence of her<br>having some short time before, exhibited strong symptom of mental derangement,<br>a respite of fourteen days was granted, to see if it was true; but we understand there<br>was no truth in it.<p>About two o'clock, the prisoner came into the Hall, attended by the Magistrates<br>and the Rev. Messrs. Clugston and Rankine, and at her desire, the 51 st psalm, from<br>the 7th to the 12th verse was sung. Towards half-past two, the prisoner signified<br>her readiness to ascend the scaffold, to which she was assisted by the Rev. Messrs.<br>Clugston and Rankine, and after seating herself on a chair, Mr. C. commenced the<br>last devotional services, by giving out, as selected by the prisoner, a portion of the<br>5th hymn, and by her desire, beginning at the line, " not in my innocence I trust"<br>Mr. C. having requested the assembled multitude join in the last devotional ex-<br>ercises with their fellow-mortal on earth, the request was generally complied with.<br>At its conclusion the prayer Offered up left with many present, an impression which<br>is not likely soon to be efficed. The Executioner now adjusted the rope round the<br>neck of the unhappy woman, and drew the cap over her face. She was then sup-<br>ported to the fatal drop, on which she stood 38 minutes engaged in prayer, and ad-<br>dressing the crowd. In her last prayer she confessed many aggravated sins, and<br>cried loudly for mercy through the Redeemer, but did not confess the crime for<br>which she suffered; This she denied from the first, and Mr. Clugston who had the<br>nearest access to her heart, was not instructed either to assert her innocence, or ac-<br>knowledge her guilt. At 20 minutes past 3, the drop fell, and she died without a <br>struggle. Her composure of mind during the whole was astonishing. After hang-<br>ing the usal time, her body was cut down, and sent to Edinburgh for dissection. The<br>executioner from Edinburgh officiated, and the crowd was immense.<p>In the house formerly occupied by her in Arbroath, there is occasionally heard,<br>(particularly in the night time) a fearful noise, as if of tongues, doors rattling, fire-<br>irons clattering, & c.; so that the present occupants lose many an hour and night's<br>sleep. Mr. William Prophet; stone-ware merchant, and family, occupy the whole<br>house. Several people who have had occasion to be in the house, have heard the<br>noises, and concur with the family in speaking of them. Whatever the cause of<br>them may may be, the truth of this statement is beyond all controversy. Ghost or<br>no ghost, the family are fearfully annoyed.<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  John Muir, printer, Glasgow.</p>
