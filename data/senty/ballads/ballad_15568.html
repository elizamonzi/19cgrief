	<h2>Transcription</h2>
	<p> Lamentation for George Gilchrist<br>Under sentence of Death in Edinburgh,<p>Come all ye night walkers a warning take by me,<br>Now I have received my sentence to die most shamefully;<br>OH the third day of August', at the head of Libberton Wind<br>You will behold my wretched fate, a warrning take in time<br>On the twenty-fourth of March, in this same year thirty-one;<br>Me and my brother William and Morrison and Brown<br>We into the Prince Regent coach as passengers inside,<br>Drtst in a female's garb-,'twas my knavery to hide.<p>By Satan's dark delusions from bad to worse I came<br>And how to plunder the bank box I soon fell on a plan;<br>There I did act a modest part, like those of women kind.<br>And the guard, I'm sure,never dream'd what then ran in my mind<p>A hammer and a chissel there, with pistols too I had.<br>To execute my dark design, and not a word was said<br>Then one firm stroke I gave the box which made the hinges fly<br>The coach it still being running on, no noise the could dis[  ]<p>the booty then I made my own and soon we all went on,<br>But little did the coachman dream what I had been about;<br>'when they arrived in Bathgate, with horror and dismay,<br>They found the box had opened been, and the money taken away<p>Who then could be suspected, those c[ ]achsm n they were clear,<br>But the eye of justice on them suspicious did appear;<br>They little thought George Gilchrist, whom they took for a wife<br>Had been the one that robbed it, and now forfeits his life.<p>Now there are three that have got clear,and I am left to die<br>But for to scandalize them I never mean to try;<br>I dare not say they're guilty, the law it set them free<br>But only for King's evidence, one would have died with me.<br>But now is time that I prepare for that great bar on high,<p>The Judge omnipotent there sits, and justice is his throne,<br>From him I hope for mercy when from this world I'm gone<p>My sentence here, I must confess,, that it on earth is just,<br>And may it prove a warning when I'm laid in the dust,<br>To all who follow gambling, for nothing good ensues,<br>To them that drops their business and idleness pursues.<br>My days on earth are numbered, no mercy here I'll find,<br>'Soon I must bid adieu to all the busy scenes of time ;<br>But there is mercy out of sight, concealed from mortal eyes,<br>The greatest sinner that returns the Lord will not despise.<p>.Death's dreadful apparatus will soon erected be,<br>,Upon the third of August a dreadful sight you'll see ;<br>From the Tron Church till the West Bow the crowd will there<br>extend.<p>Upon that awful morning to witness my sad end.<br>The fatal drop it will  give way, then time to me is past,<br>Stretch forth thy arms, thou gracious Judge, and help me<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  the last;<p>Even yet I hope for mercy through thy redeeming Son,<br>New I must bid you all adieu, my glass is nearly run.</p>
