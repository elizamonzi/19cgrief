	<p> HORRID<p>A Full, True. and Particular Account of that most Horrid and<br>Barbarous Murder, committed by JAMES FRASER, a chim-<br>ney-sweeper, in Blackfriars' Wynd, this day on the body of his<br>own Wife, by striking her on the back of the head with a leaden<br>bullet.<p>It has again become our painful duty to record another<br>of the shocking depravity of human nature, in the recurrence of<br>one of those most diabolical and attrocious crimes which have of<br>late years so foully stained the annals of this enlightened country.<p>Murder is a crime of the darkest hue, and its perpetration is<br>looked upon with such utter abhorrence, that'the bare mention of<br>its being committed upon an entire stranger or even an avowed<br>enemy to the murderer, causes the blood of the most callous indi-<br>vidual to run cold in its circulation through the human frame;<br>but with how much additional horror is the perpetration of this<br>foul crime attended when committed by a man possessed of all the<br>powers of reason and reflection upon the wife of his bosom, the<br>partner of his joys and sorrows, and whom he is bound both by the<br>laws of God and man to protect even unto death. Yet it is a<br>matter of melancholy reflection that deeds of this foul description<br>have of late years become of too frequent occurrence in what was<br>wont to be termed " moral Scotland ;"?and, not with standing of<br>the many awful warnings and examples which have consequently<p>seen exhibited by the law, we are again called upon to add another<p>case to the horrid catalogue.<p>This day, at two o'clock, a sootyman of the name of James Fra-<br>er, residing in Blackfriars' wynd, was taken into custody on a<br>charge of murder, committed on the body of his own wife.<p>It appears that the deceased and her husband were in the ha-<br>bitual custom of indulging themselves so freely in the use of ar-<br>dent spirits, that they frequently quarrelled themselves, and often<br>set the whole neighbourhood in an nproar.<p>The deceased was conveyed in a hand-barrow to the police-of-<br>fice, to await an examination by the proper authorities, and the<p>husband has likewise been taken into custody.<p>Fraser and his wife, it is understood, had had a quarrel in the<br>morning, and, it is believed, she received the fatal stroke behind<br>the ear, and possibly with a leaden bullet as used by chimney-<br>sweeps in their usual employment.<p>In the present early stage of the investigation, it would he high-<br>ly improper in us to indulge in a repetition of the various state-<br>ments we have heard connected with this horrid crime.<p>Such is the account of this affair which has reached us : But it<br>is necessary, of course, to receive them with the utmost caution,<br>until the production of legal evidence on the charge.<p>Jack at Trafalgar.?A veteran at the battle of Trafalgar, who<br>was actively employed at one of the guns on the quarter-deck of<br>the Britannia, had his leg shot off below the knee, and observed<br>to an officer who was ordering him to be conveyed to the cock-pft,<br>"That's but a shilling touch ; an inch higher and I should had my<br>eighteen-pence for it; alluding to the scale of pensions allowed for<br>wounds, which, of course, increase according to their severity.<br>The same hearty fellow, as they were lifting him on a brother<br>tar's shoulders, said to one of his friends, " Bob, take a look for<br>my leg, and give me the silver buckle out of my shoe: I'll do as<br>much for you, please God, some other time."<p>Black guard?(See Johnson, &c.)?a term said to be derived from<br>a number of dirty, tattered, and roguish boys, who attended at the<br>Horse-Guards, and Parade in St. James's Park, to black the boots<br>and shoes of the soldiers, or to do any other dirty offices. These<br>from their constant attendance about the ime of guard mounting,<br>were nick-named the Black Guards.<p>Sanderson, Printer, High Street.</p>
