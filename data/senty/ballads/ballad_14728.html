	<h2>Transcription</h2>
	<p> Execution.<p>Account of the behaviour in confinement and on the Scaffold,<br>of JAMES GLEN, who suffered at Glasgow on Wednes-<br>day the 12th of December, 1827, for the terrible, cruel, and<br>barbarous Murder of his own infant child, by throwing it<br>into the Forth and Clyde Canal, at a place called the New<br>Plash, with an account of his sorrowful parting with his<br>friends. His body was afterwards given for disscetion,<p>GLASGOW, l2th Dec. 1827.<p>This day, the awful sentence of death was fulfilled upon the above unhappy<br>man, for the brutal murder of his own child, James Glen, a child 17 months old,<br>on the lst May, 1827, by barbarously and feloniously choaking and strangling the<br>said child, and squeezing its throat with his hands, or by tying a string tight round<br>its throat, or by some other means, and did afterwards throw it into the Forth and<br>Clyde Canal, at a place called the New Plash, on the 9th of the said month of May,<br>of which murder he was found Guilty before the High Court of Justiciary at Edin-<br>burgh on the 10th November last, and received the sentence of death, and was sent<br>back to Glasgow afterwards, to await the time of its execution.<p>Since his conviction, he has been very penitent and resigned to his fate, and paid<br>every attention to the Ministers who attended him in his Christian devotions, and<br>who explained to him various passages fitted for his instruction and comfort in his<br>awful and trying situation. After 8 o'clock, he entered the Hall, and was assisted<br>there by those Ministers who previously attended him, and after putting up prayers<br>and praise in his behalf, he proceeded to the scaffold, where, after spending a few<br>minutes in fervent prayer, he gave the signal, and after a few struggles, his spirit<br>fled to an unknown state. His body, after hanging, about thirty-five minutes, was<br>cut down, and conveyed, under a proper escort, to Dr. Jeffrey, Professor of Ana-<br>tomy in the College of Glasgow, for public dissection.<p>The case of this unfortunate man did not excite much commisseration, owing to<br>the horrid nature of the deed; a man to murder his own child, in order to get clear<br>of expense, after receiving it under his charge from its mother, cannot in the smal-<br>lest degree be justified. Though it was illegitimate, it was he that was to blame,<br>and therefore should have protected, and not mangled, murdered, and thrown into<br>the Canal, a child of 17 months old, perhaps at the time smiling in the father's face,<br>and the body of which he afterwards passed lying on the banks of the Canal, blam-<br>ing some person in that neighbourhood for doing the deed. The only defence that<br>he made on his trial was, that he gave the child to  a  poor woman whom he met in<br>the Cowcaddens. He gave her 12 shillings for its support. Denied murdering it,<br>or being accessory to its death, but we understand, has since owned his guilt.<p>He took an affectionate leave of his relatives and friends the day previous to his<br>execution, and hoped they would not grieve on his account, but live in peace and<br>good will with all mankind. He was sorry that any act which he had committed,<br>should tend to stain their reputation, and hoped that none would blame them on<br>his account. The meeting was most affecting, especially at parting.<p>He was a good looking young man, about 22 years of age, and was carter. He<br>belonged to New Kilpatrick, and has  resided in other country villages. He has<br>a number of decent friends, who are left to mourn over his untimely end. He was<br>decently dressed in black, and thanked the Governor and other servants in the jail<br>for the kind treatment he had received from them. He made his escape along with<br>some  other prisoners, by breaking the  jail, but gave himself up before his trial.<p>The fate of this young man should prove a warning to all, to keep from every<br>thing that might tend to lead from the strict line of integrity, and not to imbrue<br>their hands in the blood of a fellow creature, be he old or young, friend or enemy.<p>W. Carse, Printer, Glasgow.</p>
