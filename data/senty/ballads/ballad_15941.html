	<p>  BATTLE<p><p>An account of a horrible dispute which took place between a Cobler, and<br>his Wife the day after  King Crispian's procession; For the Cobler had<br>that day got tiptinto his fob the price of heelingand soling a pair of<br>shoes and went into a public house in the Grasmarket and where the wife<br>catched him with an account of what happened<p>I wonder where does my old cob-<br>ling,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;bungling,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;sapless,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;brainless<br>noddle ramble to at this time of the<br>night, amongst his drunken sots and<br>companion I'll warrant you; but I'll<br>go seek for him, and if I meet with<br>a spark upon the way that will tip<br>for a  sixpence to  graft a pair of<br>horns upon his head, and make him<br>a fit companion for the rest of the<br>Ram-horned&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bucks of the town.?<br>When I found him, he was sitting<br>in a tap-room of that well known<br>Public-house, the sign of the Cat<br>and Bagpipes,  crying  out,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Land-<br>lord be frisky and bring us more<br>whisky, for we'll never be hanged<br>for debt.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When in comes his dear<br>loving wife,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;with a  hey-day&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr.<br>Mend-all, Mr. Spend-all, Mr. Good-<br>for-nothing at-all, bad in bed and<br>worse  up, have I found you  here<br>roaring out for more guzel, whilst I<br>and  your  three&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;poor&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;children&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;at<br>home have  neither meat, drink nor<br> candle light, but in a starving con-<br>dition;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I tell you  what Margery,<br>sit  down&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and  be  good company,<br>these are all  my old friends and ac-<br>quaintances,  and will help me to<br>more work; it was Rob, Tom and<br>  Harry,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;that  brought me  here to<br>spend our three farthings a-piece ;<br>  I,  with a plague to you and them<br>both; three farthings might be your<br>challenge, but will as many shill-<br> ings pay your shot.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I'll tell you<br>what, my dear wife, if you do not<br> sit down and  be  good  company,<br>walk home, take your supper, and<br> go to bed, and I'11 follow you when<br>I  am ready.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The poor woman ne-<br>ver grew angry till she heard the<br>Word go home; I believe she would<br> sooner have got a glass of whisky<br>at the time, when she began to him,<br>with you funk, you fop, you kitchen<br>Sop, you juis of a dish-cloath, you<br>syrop of a cinder, you hog, you cob-<br>ling dog and  worse, there has not<br>been as much meat in our house for<p>this week past as would feed a mous,<br>were it not for the honest steekstich<br>to  get a bit to keep soul and body<br>together for farting I would tell you<br>how I get it to, and that would be<br>nothing to your credit.<p>O you scandless jade how can<br>you say so ; where is the half peck<br>of coals and the sixpenny loaf that<br>I left in the cupboard the other<br>day, your house is liker a cook sho p<br>than a poor man's house; if I hear<br>any more of your complaints I'll<br>give you your breakfast with strap<br>leather to-mo-row morning, that<br>will serve you for six months or<br>longer ; you wish to make me be-<br>lieve that I don't  know the diffe-<br>rence between a sheeps-head and a<br>carrot ; nor do you know the diffe-<br>rence yourself, you rascle, were it<br>uot for our honest neighbour Mr.<br>Stitch the tailor, your poor children<br>would long since been in the poor-<br>house, you in bridwell, and your<br>poor wife in bedlam. O madam<br>I understand how the game goes<br>you and Mr. Stitch takes a stitch in<br>my absence ; but I swear by my last<br>and awl, if ever he enters my house<br>or stall, I'll castrate the rascle, and<br>tell the merry tale to the rest of my<br>horned companions how I spoil'd<br>your sport.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  <p>She did not like to hear the tailor<br>beat down in any such a manner, she<br>flew at him like a pole-cat, fastened<br>-her claws in the hair of his head,<br>crying out you rascle if all your<br>soudering,brazeriug, tinkering coop-<br>ering, soot-bag society were at your<br>back I would let you know the dif-<br>ference between a sheeps-head and<br>a carrot.?The clock struck twelve,<br>the landlord bundled them both out<br>of doors, and they walked both has-<br>tily up the street for fear of the po-<br>lice, and got into their own house,<br>where they ended the battle with the<br>strap and pinchers.<p>PRINTED FOR JOHN CAMERON.</p>
