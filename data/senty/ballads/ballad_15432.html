	<h2>Transcription</h2>
	<p> An Account of the Trial and Sentence<br>of&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thomas&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Black, and  John Reid<br>two Boys, who are to be Executed at<br>the  head of Libertons Wynd Edin.<br>on Wednesday the  10th day of Dec.<br>next, for House breaking and Robbery<br>in the Neighbourhood of Leith.<p>Tuesday, 4th November, 1823. This day came on before the<br>High Court of Justiciary the Trial  of John Reid, and Thomas<br>Black, accused of having, on the night of the 24th of June, 1823,<br>broke into the house of Mr Alexander White, merchant in Leith,<br>at Summerfield, in the parish of South Leith, and stolen therefrom<br>thirteen tea spoons, six toddy ladles, a sauce spoon and a divider,<br>all of silver; also a plated gravy spoon, a plated fish knife, plated<br>wine funnel, a blue coat, an olive surtout, two black pairs of silk<br>stockings, a night cap, and a musical snuff box, the property of<br>Mr Alex. White ; also a blue coat ann toilonette vest, the proper-<br>ty of William White, residing in the above-mentioned house; and<br>for being habit and repute thieves.<p>The Prisoners pled Not Guilty, and their declarations were<br>then read.<p>There was a list of 18 witnesses against the prisoners. From<br>the evidence of the witnesses who were examined, among whom<br>Mr White, Margaret Bremner, and Cathrine Farquhar, his two<br>house servants, were the principal, we have collected the following<br>particulars. On the evening of the 24th day of June, the house<br>was broke into, and the above articles carried off; the witnesses<br>identified part of the articles in the court. Some days previous<br>to that en which the robbery was committed, one of the witnesses<br>observed the prisoners lingering about the house and seemingly<br>taking a narrow inspection of the premises; she observed this to<br>her neighbour, and next day they both saw the prisoners walking<br>in the same manner. The pannels entered the house by a window<br>in the second story, to which they climbed up by the assistance of<br>a pailing. The officers of Police apprehended the prisoners in the<br>house of a Mrs Pirric, along with part of the articles; this Mrs<br>Pir:ie was also a witness on the trial.<p>After hearing counsel on both sides, the Lord Justice Clerk<br>summed up the evidence in the most clear and distinct manner ;<br>he made the observation, that had Mr Whyte awoke and endea-<br>voured to seize the prisoners, they would in all probability have<br>become the perpetrators of the still more horrid crime of murder<br>rather than be taken into custody at the time.<p>The Jury retired for about half an hour, and returned a verdict<br>of Guilty, but on acconnt of their youth, recommended them<br>to mercy.<p>The prisoners are both very young men, Black appeared to be<br>about 17, and Reid abont 15 years of age. They appeared very<br>indifferent during the examination of the witnesses, and the<br>solemn exhortation they received from the Lotd Justice Clerk<br>seemed to affect them very much. Black sat with his hat on<br>during the trial, which is very unusual.<p>The Lord Justice Clerk then addressed the prisoners at consid-<br>erable length in  the most feeling manner,  warning them&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;not to<br>rely on mercy, but prepare themselves for that awful end to which<br>their own acts had brought them.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He then sentenced them to be<br>Executed at Edinburgh on Wednesday 10th December next.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Printed for B, Brown...Price ONE PENNY.</p>
