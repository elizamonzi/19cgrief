	<p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;AN ACCOUNT OF THE<p>Horrid and Barbarous<p>OF<p>Helen&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;McDougal,<p>Wife of the Miscreant BURKE, who was Strangled to Death by<br>a number of Women at Deanstone Mills about a mile from Doun<br>near Perth.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<p>Glasgow, 25th April, 1829.<p>It appears that Helen McDougall wife of the miscreant Burke, after her lib-<br>eration from Edinburgh, took her way to Glasgow where she remained for a<br>number of days till the suspicion of the persons whom she lodged with, caused<br>her repeatedly to shift, after which she bent her way to the Readon, where her<br>parents reside and holds a respectable situation, and where she remained for some<br>time, but being greatly annoyed one night her parents were under the necessity of<br>conveying her out of the back window in the middle of the night, and leave her to<br>spent the remainder of her wretched life in the best way she could. She then took<br>her way to Stirling where she stopt some time, and took up with a man of the<br>name of Campbell, a native of Perth, where they dwelt there for about one<br>month, being a stranger in the place, a suspicion arose, and she was recognised<br>on Tuesday last, and was resolved to go to Deanstone Cotton Mills, her man be-<br>ing a Spinner, and on her arrival there, he had got employment for three days<br>only, when she was totally discovered before she was aware of it, Campbell being<br>absent at the time, on the morning of Thursday when the Mills were going<br>in, she was attacked by a great number of Individuals most of them Females,<br>who attacked her furiously, siezed her by the hair of the head and strangled her,<br>one of the woman dispatched her by putting her foot on her breast, and crushed<br>her severely, she was then carried to a neighbouring house, where she expired<br>in the course of a few minutes. This put an end to the West-Port Murderers,<br>except Hare's Wife, who escaped from Belltorbett, on the death of her Husband.<p>MURDER of HARE.<p>On the night of friday the 10th April, about twelve o'clock, Hare took up his abode in the house of one<br>Atkinson, who was one of his old accomplices. The house was surrounded by a large mob, who swore<br>that they would Murder every person in the house if they did not give up Hare. In an instant they rus-<br>hed forward, broke open the door, and searched every corner, some person on the  outside observed him <br>coming  out of the top of the chimney, where in a  moment of time he was brought to the ground, and<br>in a few minutes his body was so much mangled that he was taken by the police to a surgeon's shop and<br>his wounds dressed, but he died in the course of four hours.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Printed for D.
