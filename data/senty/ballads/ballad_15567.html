	<p> ROBERT  STIRRAT'S<p>Confession of the Murder of his own<br>Aunt in John Street, Glasgow.<p> The morning was calm,and a dawned with joy,<p>To the hearts of the weary,now freed from em-<p>ploy. <p>And the day it was sacred, to rest set apart,<p>When Stirrat resolved to pierce his aunt's heart,<p>With the eye of a Demon he watched the day.<br>That he might take the life of the lady away.<p>And fix'd on his plan, he in silence doth wait,<p>Till a fit hour arrived for sealing her fate.<p>The widow, worn out, lieth down for repose,<br>The wretch, to her bedside, in silence he goes,<p>And looks, with blood, his vile hands now might <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; sleep.<p>With an axe in his hand he proceeds to her bed.<p>And , with  this bloody weapon, he lays her quite<p>dead.<p>He plunder'd the house and then went away.<p>For his guilty mind would not allow  him to stay.  <p>He flies to the change-house to seek for relief,<br>To drown all his cares, and create a belief.<p>Should he be suspected, he was not to blame.<p>Of such a soul deed, and  to hide his own shame.<br>The news of the murder did spread far and near,<br>Whilst, for the old lady some shed the sad tear,<p>And he , to escape, then to Gourock did fly,<p>In hopes that some vessel would quickly draw<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;night<p>He hop'd to arrive in some far distant clime,<p>And escape from the punishment due to his crime,<p>But the strict  hand or justice did mar his career,<br>And caught him secure, when he thought to get<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; clear.<p>He had, while in Gourock, committed a crime.<p>Which led to his seizure at the very time,<p>When the servants to justice had some hint of the<p>man.<p>And thought it was Stirrat, who from Glasgow<br>had ran.<p><p>They soon recogniz'd him, and brought him away,<p>And into a carriage, without more delay,<p>They brought  him to Glasgow, and while there<p>did unfold.<p>The murder so horrid, it makes our blood cold.<br>He own'd it was he that the base deed had done,<br>On his aunt, who had us d him like  an only son,<br>For the sake of her treasure he had shed the<p>blood.<p>Which came streaming from her, like unto a flood<p>His guilt having own'd he now lieth in jail,<p>The sad shocking end of his aunt to bewail;<p>Of  one who esteemed him and was his support,<br>But mark the reward which his fond aunt has<p>got.<p>Be warned all ye, who this tragedy read,<p>And  never  be prompted  to such a base deed ;<p>Such actions a this for a time may be done,<p>But they will be found out, and made clear as <p>the sun.<p>wm, CARSE, Printer.</p>
