I say again, GOD for<br>ever preserve the Church of England, and make her Glorious, that all that dissent<br>from her may be Converted to her:<p>I Heartily pray that GOD would look upon this once Flourishing but now mi-<br>serable distracted Nation, and heal the Breaches there of by the only Expedient which<br>remains, and which is in the Hands of GOD to fulfil ; baffling all the Desgns and<br>Devices of wicked Men and Angels, against Truth, Justice, and Peace.<p>I beg of you all to help and assist me in this Hour of Death, with your servent<br>Prayers to the Father of Mercies, that I may be strengthened to overcome it thro'<br>the Blood of the Lamb, and have a Part in the Resurrection to Eternal Life. LORD<br>JESUS have Mercy on my Soul, LORD JESUS receive my Spirit. Amen,<br>LORD JESUS.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  <p>LONDON Printed, and EDINBURGH Re-Printed.</p>
