	<p> LETTER from a Friend on a Journey to the North, to an In<br>habitant of Auld Reekie; being a CURIOUS and ENTER-<br>TAINING MEDLY OF SCOTCH SONGS.<p>DEAR GEORDIE,<p>HAVING lately had a Northern<br>Excursion, I regretted much not having the<br>pleasure of your company, as I am very cer-<br>tain the company and entertainment I met<br>With would have afforded you a fund of<br>amusement. I shall, as near as I can recol-<br>lect, give you a detail of the proceedings.<p>AFTER getting some cauld kail in Aber-<br>deen with John  Roy Stewart,  I accompanied<br>him to the house below the hill, where green<br>grow the rashes,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and where two or three of<br>the merry lads of Ayr were taking their botlle<br>of  punch,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;having&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;lately come&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;fire&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;bonny<br>Doon.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Landlord  was Johnny M'Gil,<br>who you ken married the subcr's  daughter<br>She gave us a hearty welcome, for blythe  wae<br>she butt and ben, and  when she came  ben she<br>bobbit, and introduced us to Maggie Lauder<br>Mary Grey, &c.,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;not forgetting the bonnie<br>nce&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;thing.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They were all waiting the ar-<br>rival of Lucy Campbell,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;frae within a mile o'<br>Edinburgh ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;for you maun ken Lucy was to<br>be married to the ranting roarin  Highland<br>man:  So down we sat to cakes and ale, and<br>were very happy,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;when ope flew the door<br>and in a  short moment started  the  soldier<br>laddie.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I thought it had been Johnny com-<br>ing. but na, faith, says Peggie Bawn, it is<br>John Anderson, my joe, frae bonnie Dundee,<br>for he would be a soldier.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Most of us know-<br>ing John,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;we wanted him  to&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;take a seat<br>He took out. his fiddle,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and  was beginning<br>to touch the bush aboon Traquair ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but was<br>stopped by Duncan Grey,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;who&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;begged he<br>would first favour us with God save the King.<br>Hang the King,  says Charlie Stewart, who<br>was immediately knocked down by Jack, the<br>brisk young drummer,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;who is a bonnie bold<br>soldier.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We all thought that Lewie Gordon<br>would have interfered, who was standing in a<br>corner whistling Johnnie Cope, When in came<br>the wandering sailor singing hearts of oak,<br>with black-eyed  Susan in the one hand, and<br>the oak stick in the other.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Bare Lewie did<br>not like a' that and a' that,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but slunk away<br>as pale as Hosier's ghost.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Duncan Davison<br>was begining to cry kick the rogues out, when<br>in the midst of the scuffle,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;we had notice by<br>Roys wife of Aldevalloch, of the arrival of the<br>young couple frae the walking of the fauld ;<br>when the cry was,  busk  ye,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;busk ye, fy let<br>us a' to the bridle.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; By this you will under-<br>stand that Johnnie has made a wedding o't.<br>They were just going,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;when Jenny Nettles<br>hinted that the ale wife and  her barrel must<p>be paid; on which we bid the gudewife count<br>her lawin ; so each of us had a saxpence un-<br>der our thumb, and Jennie's bawbee made up<br>the same.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  On coming to the back of the<br>change-house,  where the wedding was held,<br>near the mill,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;mill, O,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;we were met by the<br>lads of Doon, gallanting the lasses o' Stew-<br>arton.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The best man was ranting roaring<br>Willie, and I as sure you Wilde is a wanton<br>wag;  the best maid was Catherine Ogie,<br>who is the bonniest lass in a' the world except<br>my jo, Janet.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Our dinner consisted of the-<br>roast beef of Old England, lumps of pudding,<br>the haggis o' Dunbar, bannocks o' barley meal,<br>&c. &c.,?as for myself,  they put a sheep's<br>head in the pat:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And after dinner we had<br>dribbles o' brandy ; the whole cry was fill the<br>stoup and haud it clinking, by no means drink<br>hooly and fairly.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then, come gie's a song<br>the ladies cry; so Patie came up frae the glen<br>and whistled o'er the lave o't&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;was sung,  and<br>Maggie' tocher.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Oh, if you had seen auld<br>Rob Morris  laughing at the auld wife ayont<br>the fire singing,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;O as I was kissed yestreen<br>We now were sae  merry growing, as  we two<br>hae been,  and some of them began to trip<br>upon trenchers:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So the dansing commenced.'<br>The bride came up frae the byre,  and  led<br>down with one of the braw lads of Galla-<br>water, to the tune of the Campbells  are  com-<br>ing.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The glancing o' her apron on, silken snood,<br>and the gowd on her garters, made my heart<br>gae pittie pattie.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I danced a reel with the<br>maid o' the mill and the shepherd's wife,  to<br>the tune I'll make fain to follow me.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; An-<br>drew wi'  his cuttie gun was at kiss me sweetly<br>wi' Bess the gawkie.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In short, we a' danced<br>heartily,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but  I observed Jenny  dang  the<br>weaver and  scoffed and scorned at him, say-<br>ing, O gin ye mere ane and twenty,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tam.<br>After this we had gude night and joy.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I<br>came lodling hame, not drunk nor yet sober,<br>and expected a bonnie tree house and a canty<br>wee fire ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but I could not open the door till<br>three,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;nor waken sleepin Maggie :&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At last<br>my o in kind dcerie  heard me,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and she rose<br>and let me in.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  By this time  I was a sleepy<br>boddie,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and got to bed by the light of the<br>bonny grey eyed morn.<p>I expect,  in return for the above detail,<br>you will  favour me with an authentic copy of<br>your journal first cruise you take,<p>Yours truly,<p>W.W.<br>1st  day  5th month,, A. D. 1822.</p>
