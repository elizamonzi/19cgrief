	<p> THE&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  VISION!<p>THE following VERSES, relative to the melancholy situation of the unfortunate WILLIAM POLLOCK,<br>now under Sentence of Death in the Jail of Edinburgh, for the Murder of his own Wife, and<br>who is to be Executed on Wednesday the 22d current, and his Body to be given for public Dissec-<br>tion, were composed by the author, one morning in bed, after having dreamed, he had really heard<br>the unhappy man making his Lamentation in a similar strain to these Lines.<p>'Twas night, and now the wearied sun<br>In western skies had set; <br>The time was come when men their cares<br>In sweet repose forget<br>Tir'd of the bustle of the day,<br>In solitude I hied<br>To where, from noise and toil set free,<br>My thoughts might range at wide.<br>By yon dark Jail I pass'd along,<br>For criminals prepar'd,<br>When from its cells a piteous sound<br>Of woe, methought I heard.<br>I sped to whence it did proceed,<br>The words distincter grew;<br>A murderer thus his fate bewail'd,<br>And did for mercy sue.<br>" Lock'd arc the golden gates of day,<br>'Tis thine, O night! the keys to keep,<br>Morpheus, in velvet's soft array,<br>Has hush'd the busy world to sleep.<br>Now Faucy waves her magic rod,<br>And roving spreads her airy wings ;<br>Now flatter'd Kings assume the God,<br>And dreaming vassals ape their kings.<br>The lover, free from hopes and fears,<br>In exstacy imparts the kiss ;<br>The nymph, undone, forgets her tears,<br>Exulting in imagin'd bliss.<br>They hail kind sleep in poppies drest,<br>Health's sweetest sister, queen of peace,<br>In her distinction sinks to rest,<br>In her their daily troubles cease,<br>To me no calm like this is known ;<br>Sleep from my eyes has ever fled ;<br>Conscience its snaky head has rais'd,<br>And all my sins before me led.<br>No more to me shall smiling morn<br>That joy impart all nature feels ;<br>Nor ev'ning's shade my grief assuage,<br>Which others cares and sorrows heal.<p>Far from my wretched mind has hope<br>On fleetest pinions soar'd away ;<br>No comfort left my state to cheer,<br>No balm my anguish to allay.<br>Companions in my revels, think<br>What you are now, and soon must be,<br>For God has me a warning made,<br>That speaks with solemn voice to thee.<br>Before to morrow's sun shall rise<br>To cheer the world, ah! who can tell,<br>But death may plunge your trembling souls<br>Down to the realms where devils dwell.<br>Oh ! can you bear the dreadful thought,<br>Should God this  night your souls require,<br>Can you endure eternal wrath,<br>Or bear the pangs of quenchless fire ?<br>O ! Pow'r Divine, my sins forgive:<br>Thou'rt gracious,  grace extend to me,<br>That when my flesh is turn'd to nought;<br>My spirit may be, Lord, with thee.<br>A few short days, and I am plac'd<br>Beyond the reach of mortal woe ;<br>Protect me in that trying hour,<br>That I may Satan overthrow.<br>Farewell my children, friends, and all,<br>For you my tears in torrents fall,<br>Forgive the effusions of my love,<br>We part in hope to meet above.<br>A few more hours, the struggle's past,<br>Life's curtain on this world is cast.<br>And then our spirits will soar above,<br>Where all is joy, and peace, and love."<br>The voice now faint and fainter grew ;<br>With solemn thoughts imprest,<br>I  left th' abode of wretchedness,<br>And hasted home to rest.<br>But e'er my eye-lids I could close,<br>On bended knees I fell,<br>And pray'd that all might be secur'd<br>From wickedness and hell.</p>
