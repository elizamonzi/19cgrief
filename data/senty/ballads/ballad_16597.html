	<p> Ayr Autumn Circuit;<p>The Autumn Circuit was opened in the Court House, County<br>Buildings. on Wednesday last October 4, 1848, by Lords Mackenzie<br>and Medwyn.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.<p>WITH  A FULL REPORT OF<p>THE TRIAL AND SENTENCE OF<p>M'WHEELAN<p>THE MURDERER!<p>JAMES M'WHEELAN or M'Queen was placed at the bar on a<br>charge of murder, as also robbery, in so far as, on the 26th or 27th of<br>May last, when on or near the turnpike road, commonly called Black-<br>hill Road, leading from Forty Acres Toll Bar, in one or more of the<br>parishes of Dundonald, Riccarton, and Symington, in Ayrshire, he did<br>wickedly and feloniously attack and assault James Young, then a farm<br>servant in the employment of Joseph Smith, farmer, Forty Acres, and<br>did, with a stone or some other instrument, strike the said James<br>Young severe blows on or near the head, and did. with chisel or some<br>other instrument, inflict a severe wound on or near his neck, to the<br>great effusion of his blood, in consequence of which he immediately<br>the reafter died, and was murdered by the said James M'Wheelan or<br>M'Queen. He was farther charged with having, time and place above<br>libelled, wickedly and feloniously, and by force and violence, taken<br>from his pocket a silver watch, a steel or other metal chain, a watch<br>key, a metal watch guard, and.fifteen shillings in silver money.<p>There were no fewer than 93 witnesses cited for this case, which, from the peculiar<br>barbarity and wantonness of the crime, excited a great interest. It commenced about<br>twelve o'clock.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<p>On being asked the question of guilty or not guilty the prisoner, an<br>Irishman, and a rather good looking stoutly built man, said, in a firm voice, " not guilty.'<br>A jury was then empannelled, and the case went to trial.<br>A number of witnesses were then examined, whose evidence went to prove the charge.<p>THURSDAY, 5TH OCTOBER,<p>The Court met at nine o'clock this morning.<p>Mr. MAITLAND, counsel for the Crown, addressed to the jury. He commented with<br>much emphasis upon the striking nature of the circumstantial evidence afforded in this<br>case: in particular as to the chisel found near the scene of the murder?also, as to the<br>possesion of the watch of the murdered man?and the napkln found on the road, all traced<br>directly to the possession of the prisoner at one time or other not distant from the mom-<br>ent of. the murder. He said that under a certain aspect circumstantial evidence was less<br>liable to misconstruction than even direct testimony. He then went over the evidence in<br>a very minute manner. He laid great stress upon the evidence of Thom, remarking that<br>the time at which the prisoner met him was just sufficient to have allowed of his walking<br>from the scene of the murder to the place wh re he overtaok Thom. He commented on<br>the general falsehood of the prisoners declaration. Harvey's evidence also he laid much<br>stress upon, by which the prisoner's direct possession of the watch was not only corro-<br>borated but fully borne out in everc particular by additional direct evidence. He spoke<br>to the general intelligence and sagacity of the witnesses Scott and Gebbie, particularly<br>alluding to their evidence in regard to the napkin found on the road, which, by a clear<br>chain of evidence was proved to have been in prisoners possession for a considerable<br>time and on the morning previous to the murder. He then alluded to the exculpatory<br>evidence, but contended that it wss not at all conclusive.<p>Mr. BOYLE, in behalf of the prisoner, would admit that the watch had belonged to<br>disceased and had been pledged at the instance of the prisoner, still it was not proved that<br>he might not have got it from the true robber and murderer; he maintained there were<br>no suspicious circumstances attending the pawning of the watch which had been pawned<br>in the prisoner's own name. The chisel found proved nothing more thon that it was the<br>instrument by which the murder was committed?nor had it been, traced to the prisoner.<br>The handkerchief was found at least a mile from the place of murder : it had no blood on<br>it, ane might not have been in any way connected with, the murder. He contended that<br>the exculpatory evinence of Wilson was of  material importance, and commented at length<br>upon the probability of the prisoner having lost his handkerchief, if it was really his, in<br>passing the spot, before the murder was committed. Ae maintained teat it was incon-<br>ceivable that tne murderer, reeking from the deed, covered with blood could be seen in<br>Kilmarnock,?this was only spoken to by one witness, which by our law cannot prove ann<br>fact The attempt to corroborate it had failed. He insisted upon the value and cony<br>clusiveness of the evidence furnished by the exculpatory witness, in relation to the pris-<br>oner's having blood of calves on his clothes, and that he had endeavoured to clean that<br>off; the combatted the effort of the prosecutor to prove that the shaving off his whiskers<br>was an attempt on his part to ovade the officers of justice ; he.was never seen in company<br>with James Young by any one, noa within three miles of the place where the murder<br>occurred. Circumstantial evidence had been so usually defective that no work, of fact or<br>fiction had ever been written in which it was alluded to, where its inefficiency had not<br>been demonstrated.<p>Lord MACKENZIE then addressed the jury at great length, carefully going over the evid<br>ence on both sides.<p>The Jury then retired, and after an absence of about half an hour returned into Court,<br>and gave in a verdict unanimously finding the prisoner guilty as libelled<p>Lord MACKENZIE then said?James M'Wheelan or M'Queen, it is now my painful<br>duty to announce, that you have been convicted, by an unauimous verdict of the jury, of<br>the whole crimes charged against you?that crime, being no less than murder and rob-<br>qery. Robbery although a capital offence by the laws of Scotland, can be dealt with<br>mercifully: but the crime of murder can receive no mercy whatever. The punishment<br>is capital. " He that shedeth man's blood, by man shall his blood be shed." The law<br>in this case, leaves me no dis retson, I'must do my duty. You must, therefore, consider<br>your life in this world at an end. A short time, and you will be conveyed to the scaffold <br>I can hold out no eopes of pardon Murder is always an atrocious Crime. There rem.<br>ains for you no hope this world. I cannot say that there will be no hope in the worl-<br>which is to come, You must stand before the judgment seat of Almighty God, when yod<br>will have to answer for this caime. His Lordship then, in the usual form sentened theu<br>prisoner, James M'Wheelan, or M'Queen, to be executed at Ayr. between the hoers of<br>eight or ten o'clock, on the forenoon of the 26th October current.</p>
