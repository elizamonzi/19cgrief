	<h2>Transcription</h2>
	<p> Trial  and Sentence.<p>JOSEPH ALLISON and MAXWELL ALLISON were charged<br>with having, on the 27th May last, at or near to the house in<br>Fisher Street, Stranraer, county of Wigton, then occupied by Joseph<br>Allison, attacked and assaulted James Mourne, or Morrin, or M'-<br>Morrin, flesher, and stab him with a bayonet, or other sharp weapon,<br>whereby he was mortally wounded, and almost immediately ex-<br>pired. The pannels pleaded not guilty.<p>James M'Crea, shoemaker, was in Prince's Street, Stranraer, about<br>2 o'clock on Sunday morning 27th May, when Morrin was killed.<br>Witness, on the morning referred to, was going along Prince's<br>Street towards Fisher Street, and saw the two prisoners, and John<br>and William Allison, sons of Joseph, at the door of a house named<br>Hainey's in Prince's Street. Saw Armstrong come out of it along<br>with James Torrance and Hugh Willie. When the men came out<br>of the house the Allisons went in the direction of Joseph Allison's<br>house, in Fisher Street, and the men followed, as did wituess. He<br>then saw Morrin fall near Allison's house. Witness was about 20<br>yards from him. Morrin was about six or eight feet off the door<br>of Allison's house. Witness could not say what made Morrin fall.<br>Saw no person near him when he fell : but just a moment before<br>saw the two prisoners near him. Did not see either of the prison-<br>ers do anything to Morrin. The Allisons were between the door<br>and Morrin, and Morrin between the witness and the Allisons ?<br>Maxwell Allison had a stick, and Joseph had a grape. Could not<br>say in what position the grape was held. The Allisons went im-<br>mediately into the house after Morrin fell. There were no one<br>nearer Morrin than witness' self, except the Allisons. When Mor-<br>rin fell witness caught him in his arms. He said nothing but died<br>instantly, without even uttering a groan.<p>Alexander Adam, printer, and James Campbell corroborated M'-<br>Crea's evidence. Ann  Main or Hashwell?lives at the corner of<br>Fisher Street and Prince's Street. Her house is next to Hainey's.<br>Was at home on the morning of the 27th May, and heard a dis-<br>turbance between 12 and 1 o'clock. In the fore part of the night<br>there was a great noise of swearing, Witness looked out at her<br>Prince's Street window, and saw a number of persons running<br>backwards and forewards. The noise continued for some time, and<br>began, again a little before 2 o'clock. The noise was in front of<br>her Prince's Street window?of persons talking of what had been<br>the fight the previous part of the night, and how they got on. Saw<br>Robert Willie; a young man, a printer; William Johnstone ; M'-<br>Cormack, a sailor ; Robert Armstrong's wife, and others. These<br>all went into Hainey's, and there was quietness for some time.?<br>Witness went to bed, and about a querter of an hour afterwards<br>was awoke by hearing a great disturbance coming round the corner<br>from Allison's. Got up, and looked out at Prince's Street window,<br>and saw a number of persons opposite the window. Knew only<br>Joseph Allison, and went to the door, and had a little conversation<br>with him. Witness mentioned the disturbance to him, when he<br>said he was sorry he had offended witness, or any of the neigh-<br>bours. He was speaking of the disturbance, when a brother, who<br>is not one of the prisoners, came up, and began a story of his wife<br>being ill ; that he had been working through the day and got wages,<br>and was going for medicine to his wife, when the money was taken<br>from him. Saw Joseph Allison have a stick under his arm, and<br>in his breast something fixed, to which a string was attached.<br>Mrs Campbell, who lives in the same house with witness was<br>looking out at the window, when witness saw something glance,<br>and she said to Mrs Campbell, " God Almighty, this man has got<br>a knife in his breast." After this, heard " Murder " often repeated,<p>Charlotte Callum or Campbell corroborated the statement of the<br>previous witness. Remembers Mrs Hashwell saying, " God Al-<br>mighty, Charlotte, look at the knife."<p>After several other witnesses were examined, the Solicitor-<br>General addressed the jury, and insisted on a verdict against Joseph<br>Allison.?Mr A Simpson, for the panels, followed, when Lord<br>Moncrieff summed up. The Jury, by a plurality, found Joseph<br>Allison Guilty of Murder, as libelled, and Maxwell Allison not<br>Guilty.<p>This morning, the unfortunate man was sentenced to be taken<br>back to Stranraer, to be fed on bread and water till Tuesday the<br>7th of August next, and then, between the hours of two and four,<br>be executed there.<p>Menzies, Printer.</p>
