	<h2>Transcription</h2>
	<p> An Account of the Trial, Sentence, and Execution<br>of DANIEL GRIMSHIRE, which took place at<br>Reading, in Berkshire, on Thursday, 4th March,<br>1824, for the Cruel and Inhuman Murder of his<br>own Child, by pouring Boiling Hot Water down its<br>Throat, and whose Body was given for Dissection.<p>THIS wretch in the shape of human nature, was arraiged at the<br>last Reading Assizes, on Tuesday March second, for the wilful<br>Murder of his own infant child, by pouring boiling hot water down<br>its throat. He pleaded Not Guilty, and said by his Maker he was<br>innocent; but the evidence was so strong and decisive against him,<br>that the Jury brought him in guilty of the Murder. The judge im-<br>mediately passed sentence of Death on him, and ordered him for<br>Execution on Thursday the 4th.<p>On returning to prison after his condemnation, he persisted inve-<br>hemently declaring his innocence, and said that the jury in bring-<br>ing him in guilty, had committed  Murder.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  The Chaplain visited<br>him immediately after, but from the agitated state of his mind, he<br>could  prod uce little effect upon him by his exhortation.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The next<br>morning at an early hour, he visited him again, and after some se-<br>rious conversation, the prisoner made a full confession of his guilt,<br>with all the eorrid circumstances attending its perpetration; from<br>which it appears he had harboured the shocking thought of murder-<br>ing his own child for several weeks, in which period he had thrice<br>attempted to carry it into execution, but his resolution had as often<br>failed him.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He said on the evening this horrid and appaling crime<br>was commited, he sent his wife for a sixpenny loaf of bread, pre-<br>tending he could not eat that which was  in the house, saying he<br>would keep the child till she came back again.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As soon as she was<br>goue he laid the child into the cradle upon its  back, and took the<br>kettle from the fire, which was boiling, and holding its mouth open<br>with his finger and thumb coldly and deliberately poured the hot<br>water into the child's mouth, which killed it in the course of the<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;night.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <p> It appears this unfortunate being had formerly been a Shepherd,<br>of which life he was particularly fond. And it seems, the motive<br> for committing this diabolical act, was a desire of returning to the<br>employment of a Shephered. The child was an impediment, he<br>considered, in the way of getting a seperation from his wife, with<br>whom he had lately had many quarrels, on account of the irregular<br>life which he led. He seldom worked above three days in the<br>week, and drank the rest; leaving her to fend for the child and<br>herself as she could.<p>The night before his execution, he asked the person who was to<br>sleep with him that night, " What he thought of dying on a gal-<br>\?\ows?", Who told him " he thought it a shocking and disgraceful<br>death." To which Grimshire answered, " he could not tell; but<br>he thought, had he secaped at present, he would have returned to<br>the hills, his conscience might have troubled him, for murdering<br>his child, and in all probability, he would have hung himself upon<br>a tree, for his part he could not see much difference there<br>could be." He then fell asleep, and slept sound till 6 o'Clock in the<br>morning. About an hour after the chaplain came, and prayed with<br>him.  He paid respectful attention to what was said, but the exhor-<br>tation seemed to make little impression on him.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <p>At eleven o'clock his irons were knocked off, and his arms pin-<br>ioned, and while they were doing so, he asked very unconsernedly,<br>" what time of day it was."&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When he was led out he said, " it was<br>a very fine day for the time of the year."&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He ascended the scaffold<br>with a firm and resolute step, he then looked round and addressed<br>the people  in a few words.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He cautioned them to beware of Drunk-<br>enness, and the love of company, observing that it was those which<br>brought him into the situation they now saw him in; and above all<br>things to attend a place of worship, and as that would harmonize<br>their minds, and bring them to a true sense of domestic happiness.<br>The cap was drawn over his face; the drop fell; he struggled twice,<br>and his earthly career was ended for ever.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Price One Penny.</p>
