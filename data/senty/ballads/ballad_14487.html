	<p> MONMOUTH and BUCLEUGH's WELCOM FROM THE NORTH:<br>OR<br>THE LOYAL PROTESTANTS JOY FOR HIS HAPPY RETURN.<p>To the Tune of York and Albany's Welcome to England. <p>When stout young Jemmy went abroad<br>To see the Northen Races,<br>He met ten Thousands in the Road,<br>That swore they were his Graces,<br>They flock about him day and night,<br>And made the Skyes to ring<br>And every one seem to delight <br>In Monmouth and the King.<p>They tost their Hats up to the Sky,<br>The Bells did sweetly sound,<br>God bless young James was all the cry,<br>No other voice was found,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>By Bonefires they exprest their joy<br>In every Town and City.<br>We scarce could see one Tory-boy,<br>Oh! was not that a pitty.<p>Both Gray and Green, both old and young,<br>The Rich as well as Poor,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  <br>Had nought but Monmouth on their Tongue,<br>In every Loyal Door,<br>His Presence made them all rejoyce,<br>A Happy man was he,<br>That could prevail with his loud voice,<br>This Noble Duke to see.<p>A sullen look we could not find,<br>Where ever Monmouth went<br>The Nobles were exceeding kind,<br>He gave them great content,<br>His very Presence like the Sun,<br>Did drive the Clouds away,<br>Their Glory they did think begun,<br>And blest that Happy-day.<p>And then began the Royal-Cup<br>To pass from hand to hand,<br>And all with joy did Drink it up<br>And wisht us Peace i'th Land,<br>The Musick playd, and some did Sing,<br>The worst is past we hope,<br>Long live Great Charles our Sacred King,<br>The D.vil confound the Pope.<p>But on a suddain there was seen<br>A Popish Imp draw near,<br>We partly guess where he had been,<br>So soon as he came here,<br>He cast a Cloud upon the Sun,<br>And would not let it Shine,<br>The Thread that thou for him hast Spun,<br>About thy Neck may twine.<p>But now our Sun with much more Glory<br>Shoots forth his Golden Rays,<br>And now in spight of every Tory,<br>He has his former Praise,<br>He shews much brighter than before<br>Your envy makes him Shine,<br>Bucleugh and Monmouth we adore,<br>And scorn the Popish Line.<p>In King and Monmouth we delight,<br>And for their lives we pray,<br>It's they must do the Free-Born right,<br>It's they and only they ;<br>If they be for us, where's the evil<br>That we can undergo,<br>We fear no Duke, no Pope, nor Divel,<br>Nor any other Foe.<p>Long may the King and his best Son,<br>Be blest with Joy and Peace,<br>And may their Threads of life be Spun<br>Till all our sorrows cease ;<br>Nay may they live and never dye,<br>In everlasting Bliss,<br>And may their Foes take Wings and fly<br>To th'Arms of Pluto's Miss.<p>May their old Love new bud again.<br>May Charles his Son imbrace,<br>Then we'l scorn Rome, and France, and Spain<br>Our strength is in his Grace,<br>If Father and the Son agree,<br>Then Heaven is on our side,<br>And then Old Pope, a fig for thee,<br>That makes our Breach so wide.</p>
