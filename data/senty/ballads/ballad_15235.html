	<p> WILLIAM BURKE'S  CONFESSION.<p>Ye people of this nation, come listen unto me<br>To young and old I will unfold this horrid tragedy,<br>Now at the age of thirty-six sentenced must  undergo,<br>For these murders, we done in the west port of Edinbro'.<br>William Burke it is my name, in Ireland  I was&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;bred,<br>I serv'd some time its well known to the shoe-making trade.<br>Before I left my native land  I took to me  a wife,<br>I left her behind. I was inclin'd to my a  roving life.<br>In 1813 to Glasgow town I came.<p>I took up with a married wife, M'Dougall  was her name,<br>She did advise me to leave town, and go to Edinbro',<br>Now of my whole transactions, I'll give you all to know.<br>For 11 months in the West Port, I think we did live there,<br>I here I became&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;cquainted with a man call'd William Hare,<br>He said he'd put me on à plan that I would money make,<br>But Oh I was a foolish man, that did his council take.<br>Our houses being convenient to trade we did begin,<br>Any fit subject I could spy I did invite them in ;<br>We did entice them for to drink, until quite drunk they lay,<br>So then by suffocation we took their lives away.<br> Mary Peterson's the first they too our charge did lay,<br>But many a life before hers its true we took away ;<br>James Wilson too poor lad its true we treated most severe,<br>I never could his strength subdue till assisted by Hare.<br>But as for Widow Campbell, who came her son to seek,<br> I did invite unto my house on last Hallowe'en week,<br>Great friendship I did seem to shew to her for country sake,<br>But when I got her head laid low, her life I then did take.<br>Another woman and her son we murdered I declare,<br>The woman's life was ta'en by me, the lad was kill'd by Hare.<br>All the murders I did commit Hare was present with me,<br>Only one that I done myself while in the country.<br>A wife we kill'd in Broggan's, but he knew of it not,<br>And a poor washer woman, L.29 for them we got;<br>Like lambs unto the slaughter, these creatures we did lead,<br>Its for nine months and better, we carried on this trade.<br>There's one atrocious murder lies heavy on my mind,<br>And when I do think on the same no rest here can I find,<br>A lovely child in my face smil'd as on my knee it lay,<br>But wretched man now that I am, I took it's life away.<br>Its above twenty bodies now unto one man we gave,<br>Not one of them I'm certain has been raised from a grave;<br>This traffick long we've carried on, but now it is all by,<br>For Hare in jail he may bewail, and I am doom'd to die.<br>With Helen M'Dougall ten years I liv'd in adultery,<br>I took  delight to rake at night and keep bad company,<br>[  ]t  young and old ta'e warning and strive this fate to shon,<br>[  ]hoy can I now think to die far crimes that I have done.<p>PULPIT ORATORY.-- A sermon was lately preached in  one of our <br>churches, Kirriemuir,  by a very popular divine, in which he gave a cata-<br>logue of Burke's crimes as minute as those which are hawked about the <br>streets, and  sent him reeling to the darkest and most dismal corners of the<br>infernal regions. One sentence ran thus:--" I do say that  it is im-<br>possible that his soulmay go to heaven, but it is altogether improbable, <br>for the holy angels would not keen company with such a criminal!"--&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<p>Dundee Advertizer. <p>PHRENOLOGY.- The Edinburgh phrenologists (says a Correspondent)<br>have been sadly thrown out in their calculations, by the skull of Burke the<br>murderer. We would suggest to them another subject which they will<br>find at hand, and with which they may have better luck. Si prodigiosa<br>qu?ris, circumspice. The West-port gang is not only one that has<br>infested Edinburgh of late; nor the present the only conspiracy to gain a<br>clandestine livelihood by shots. It is true, the Princes street gang differed<br>from the West-port in thlis, that they dealt in the carcases of reputations<br>instead of the dead bodies of their victims. The traffic was in either case<br>equally nefarious , equally mercenary, equally systematic, and carried<br>on with the profoundest secrcesy. The assassins of character picked up<br>their information by the sane sinister means, began their operations with<br>a scene of hoaxing and game making, then fell upon and strangled the<br>victims of calumny, and sold them to their employers, who made no inquiry<br>into the means, so that the ends jof utility and social order were attained.  <br>They had also their Daft Jamie, " that poor harmless innocent," Johnny<br>??; and, like the West-port ruffians, spared neither age nor sex.
