	<p> ANCIENT PROPHECY.<p>A most Wonderful and true Prophecy, which was found in an iron<br>box in a Subterraneous Cavern, near the memorable field of Cul-<br>loden, and was written three hundred years ago, and contains<br>many Discoveries of what is to take place in various kingdoms<br>of the World betwixt the years 1822 and 1826.<p>This cavern was situated in the lands of a very rich Gentleman of the name of Gordon,<br>in the neighbourhood of the famous field of Culloden, who took a notion to embellish the<br>interior of the cavern, and for that means employed some masons to raise a pillar for the<br>support of a hanging rock that projected out of the roof, and while at this work, one of<br>the masons took notice of a large square stone that seemed to be transfixed between two<br>rocks; this curiosity led him to try to get the stone out, which he soon accomplished, but<br>was much surprised to find underneath it a small iron box, about eighteen inches long.?<br>The man thinking that the box contained treasure, was very much agitated, but on break-<br>ing it open, found that it contained nothing but a large roll of parchment, all in writing;<br>but as none of  the men were able to read the writing, it was conveyed to Mr Gordon, who<br>is an excellent scholar, and with the assistance of two or three Clergymen to whom he ex-<br>hibited the roll, and who were conversant in the ancient languages, it was found to be a<br>prophecy, and wrote about three hundred years ago. It explains every thing just as they<br>came to pass in the sister kingdom for the last two hundred years ; it gives a true defini-<br>tion of the rise and fall of Buonaparte, from his first entering the French Convention, till<br>his total overthrow at Waterloo, and from that to his exile. It says, that when two crowned<br>heads from the east, and one from the north shall join, there shall be a total overthrow of<br>the Turkish Empire. It also speaks of the Queen of England's trial and acquittal, and<br>what is wonderful, it tells the exact number of days it would last, 45 days, which was the<br>exact number it did last. It also says, that between the years 1821 and 1826, that there<br>will be great blood and slaughter in the sister kingdom ; but when Ireland shall see three<br>eagles coming together in a line from the south, they may expect their troubles to be at<br>an end, and the reign of peace and prosperity shall again revisit that long divided king-<br>dom. It also speaks of the National Debt of Britain, which it says will increase to such a<br>degree, from the people not being able to pay the taxes, owing to the depressed state of<br>trade, and the agricultural interest being completely ruined, that it will be unable to fulfil<br>its engagements, and a national bankruptcy will take place in the year 1823; after that<br>period a new system of finance will be introduced, and Britain will again recover from her<br>embarrassments,  and shine forth among the nations of Europe with increased lustre.<p>There is a good deal of the writing defaced; but it is. supposed by its being in the Celtic<br>language, that it was wrote by some great prophet, when the Celtics inhabited the king-<br>dom of Scotland.<p>There being a great part of the prophecy defaced, in order to fill up the paper, we sub-<br>join the following curious prayer, which was uttered by an old carter, who was permitted<br>to lodge in a barn belonging to Mr Gregg (father of the Rev. Mr Gregg, late of St Alban's)<br>who overheard him the next morning to pray in the following manner :?" Thank God,<br>I have slept soundly to night, and so this morning am pure and well. Thank God, my ass.<br>is well, and has a good lock of hay, her crust of bread, and drank half a pail of water.?<br>God bless us both to-day, and give me strength to walk afoot, that I may'nt be forced to<br>get up and ride the poor beast, for she has luggage enough already. God Almighty send<br>that folks may want my wares, and that somebody may take a liking to my ballads; and<br>them as can afford it may give me some victuals and drink that I may not give my ballads<br>to servants for it, when their masters and mistresses dont know on't. . God Almighty lead<br>us through green lanes, where my poor ass may light on good cropping without running<br>into other folks's grass or corn ; and that poor thing she mayn't tumble down and hurt<br>herself, and break my wares. And God Almighty incline somebody to give me a night's<br>lodging; and that I may have a dry barn, and some barley straw too (an't please God), for<br>I grown old now, and a hard bed is worse than it used to be. But I dont  distrust God,<br>Almighty's care, for he never let me want in my life, and so his great  and holy name be'<br>praised now and evermore. Amen."&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  <p>This eccentric character dealt in earthen ware, and also sold ballads and histories among<br>the country people.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; '&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  <p>Printed for J. Johnstone.<p><p></p>
