	<p> SERIOUS OUTRAGE<p>and Disturbance in Glasgow.<p>An account of a Serious Outrage and Disturbance<br>in Glasgow, on Saturday night last, 21st June,<br>wheu the Military were called out, and 43 per-<br>sons were apprehended and lodged in prison.<p>On Saturday night, about eight o'clock, a number of persons from<br>Bridgeton, Rutherglen, and Camlachie, who had been accustom-<br>ed to walk on the banks of the river above Dalmarnock Bridge,<br>proceeded to clear the way by making breaches in the fortified<br>walls and fences which obstructed their former recreation. A<br>number of encouraging spectators were on the spot. Scarcely<br>had the operators finished their labour when a detachment of the<br>Enniskillen Dragoons. came up and took 43 individuals into cus-<br>tody. Several persons plunged into the river and crossed it, to<br>avoid the risk of seizure. Various individuals walked through<br>the gnps on Sunday morning ; but by and by the soldiers were<br>again employed to prevent the passage. At the time the walls<br>were erected, they were for some nights levelled by the people,<br>and it was not till a strong guard was placed.on the spot by the<br>Proprietor, that the works were finished. The spikes at the ter-<br>mination of the wall next the river were in imitation of the thorns<br>of a Scottish thistle?an unhappy emblem for the occasion. The<br>wall so finished was impregnable to the solitary walker; and,<br>though it constantly excited dissatisfaction, it stood unmolested<br>till some neighbouring prodrietors took it for a precedent, and<br>laid down stone and lime for similar works.<p>The people began the attack by collecting all in a body, the formost<br>being provided with boring instruments. About 12 stout young men<br>were assisted to the top of the wall, and with quarry wedges, levers,<br>heavy hammers &c, they split they stones in which the iron was fixed<br>and pushed the forked roller into the water with three cheers. The<br>wall which is nearly 10 feet high. and 4 feet thick, was attacked at<br>different parts, and after much labour, at half-past to the obnoxious<br>erection was erased and the former passage opened up. A person<br>made his appearance on horseback, and said, ' Well, lads, you have<br>got the wall down, I hope you will not  injure the house,' No, no,<br>was resoanded from all voices, ' we will touch nothing but public pro-<br>perty.<p>The crowd then went off to the second wall about a mile<br>distant, at the end of this wall were large piles of wood driven<br>to the edge of the water, to this they set thorns and loose<br>wood, to which they set fire to. The fire served them for a<br>light, and they soon levelled this wall also, which was very<br>strong. Some person sent to the sheriff, a statement, that an<br>assemblage, collected by beat of drum, some of them armed,<br>were committing violent outrages. Acting upon this inform-<br>ation, the Sheriff had come out with the military. The mob<br>instantly dispersed, some waded through the river, and the rest<br>flew in all directions. No resistance was made. The military<br>took 43 prisoners.<p>The road between Tollcross and Camlachie was thronged the<br>whole night by people either on the out-look for their friends, or<br>to get the news. At 5 o'clock the prisoners were brought into<br>jail, escorted by a party of cavolry, and attended by a large crowd.<br>As they entered the jail, three cheers were given them, which<br>they returned. The former walk being opened up, the lieges<br>next morning were taking that way when they were stopped by<br>the cavalry who remained there all day, and reinforcements of<br>horse and foot were sent out in the evening for the same purpose.<br>At a very early hour on Monday morning, as many masons were<br>set to work as could ger room, and the first breach was soon re-<br>built. The people were kept off by the military, who threatened<br>to fire on any who passed the limits. All the prisoners have been<br>liberated except one.?From the " Glasgow Chronicle."<p>Subscriptions for defraying the expence of clearing the pu-<br>blic walks, on the banks of the Clyde, from every annoyance,<br>are going briskly forward. This is more praise-worthy than a<br>lawless mob committing every kind of depredation.</p>
