	<p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; V.R.<p>Grand Preparations<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  FOR THE <p>Queen's Coronation !<p> <p>An Account of some of the Festivities which will take place in<br>Edinburgh and Vicinity, on Thursday the 28th June, 1838,<br>being the day appointed for the Coronation of Our Most Graci-<br>ous Sovereign, QUEEN VICTORIA FIRST.<p>A most brilliant and splendid display of Fire Works will be ex-<br>hibited from the Half Moon Battery in the Castle, on Thursday eve-<br>ning, on this joyous and auspicious occasion ; and, at the same time,<br>a large Bonefire will be lighted on the summit of Authur's Seat,<br>which must have a grand appearance from the surrounding country.<p>The Shops, and all places of Public Business, are to be shut up<br>for the whole day, to give all classes of her Majesty's subjects here<br>an opportunity to testify their joy and loyalty on this occasion.<br>It must also very satisfactory to learn, that the College Museum,<br>as well as various other Public Institutions, possessing great interest,<br>will, on Thursday, be opened to the public in general, under cer-<br>tain necessary regulations - thus affording a treat to the whole&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>citizens of Edinburgh, which is seldom attainable.<p>There is to be a Grand Banquet in the Assembly Rooms, George<br>Street, the Tickets for which are selling rapidly, and nearly all sold.<br>Also, in order to allow sufficient opportunity to the inhabitants to<br>meet together on this happy occasion, there is to be an Entertain-<br>ment in the Great Waterloo Room, Regent Bridge, in addition to<br>the Banquet in the Assembly Rooms, and there is good reason<br>to believe that every thing will be conducted in the most creditable<br>manner to the city. Several other smaller parties intend meeting<br>to celebrate the Coronation in the same happy, loyal and joyous<br>manner.<p>One of the most magnificent individual manifestations of loyalty<br>towards our youthful and beloved Queen, to be exhibited in this,<br>or we believe, any other quarter of the Empire, on Thursday first,<br>will take place on the occasion of the partial Opening of his Grace<br>the Duke of Buccleuch's splendid Pier at Granton, in the vicinity<br>of Edinburgh. All the principal Nobility and Centry at present<br>in town, being invited to a Grand Entertainment to be given on<br>the Pier that day at two o'clock, in honour of the auspicious event;<br>at which his Grace's brother, Lord John Scott, will preside. At the<br>same time, with his wonted liberality, has given orders that several<br>oxen shall be roasted, and other appropriate viands prepared?not<br>forgetting a suitable supply of liquids?in order that the whole of<br>the industrious artisans and labourers (upwards of 300 in num-<br>ber), employed on the Works, may participate in the festivities and<br>rejoicings of the day.<p>That his Grace may be long preserved to diffuse comfort and<br>happiness amongst his numerous dependants, both at Granton and<br>elsewhere, will certainly be the prevailing wish amongst all classes<br>of the community, upon the forthcoming interesting occasion.<p>And finally, among the numerous ways in which Thursday - a<br>day that will long be remembered - is proposed to be spent, the<br>clergy of the Established Church in Leith resolve to hold a meeting<br>in South Leith Church, at eleven o'clock forenoon of that day, for<br>the purpose of offering up prayers to Almighty God for a long and<br>prosperous reign to her Majesty - and that the Coronation Anthem<br>is to be sung by the Choir, and the Queen's Anthem by the chil-<br>dren attending the Charity and Sessional Schools, on the occasion.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>A Grand Cricket Match, between the Holyrood and Caledonian<br>Clubs, is to be played on Thursday, her Majesty's Coronation day,<br>on Sparkes Cricket Ground, Grove Street, which is expected to be<br>a great treat to the lovers of this noble and manly game.<p>Menxies, Printer.</p>
