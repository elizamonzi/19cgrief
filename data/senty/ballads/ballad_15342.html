	<p> STRANGE CIRCUMSTANCE<p><p>WHICH TOOK PLACE in the TOLBOOTH CH.<p><p>Jast Published, an Account of that Extraordinary &<br>Singular  Circumstsnce Which took place at the Tuesday<br>morning Lecture, in the Tolbooth Church, High Street,<br>Edinburgh ; when neither Minister or Prcentor having <br>come forward, an old Woman mounted the Pulpit, ad-<br>dressed the Audience- sung Psalms-offered up Prayers,<br>and dismissed&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the  Congregation, to  the astonishmen-<br>ed satisfaction of her Hearers<p>The Church IN DANGER. -The following singular circumstance<br>which we have on  unquestionable authority, occurred in the Tol-<br>booth Ohurch, in&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;this city.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It has  long been a Custom to have a<br> Sermon preached every Tuesday forenoon in this Church, which the<br>City Ministers preach in rotation.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On the day referred to, a congre-<br>gation of 21 persons assembled in the Church, which is seated for<br>1300,  and although&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;they  therefore could not complain for want of<br>Church accommodation, there was a great want of pastoral superin-<br>tendance.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After waiting  considerable beyond the usual time, from<br>some accidental want of arrangement, neither minister nor precentor<br>appeared.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  In this emergency,  an old woman who has been&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  regular<br>in  this Church&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;on Tuesdays for many years, resolved to supply the<br>want  of pastoral  superintendance&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to the best of her ability on the<br>Voluntary  principal.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  Accordingly she gave out a Psalm  in the usual<br>way,  and commenced singing, in&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;which she was joined by the rest.<br>of the congregation.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She then offered up  a prayer of considerable <br>length,  sung  another psalm, and dismissed the congreation  in the<br>usual manner.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The  whole&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;proceedings were conducted&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;with the<br>greatest decorum,  and we have no doubt made a lasting impression<br>on all who witnessed the  extraordinary scene.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;old  women<br>can&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;so  easily he&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;found to officiate with propriety in the absence<br> of the City Ministers, we think even Dr Chalmers will<br>admit that there is still some hope that the mast of<br>heathenism which he says abounds to such a fearful<br>extent in this City, may yet be excavated, without the<br>errection of additional Churches. It may be admitted,<br>that this astounding innovation is one of the signs of<br>the times, strongly indication that the CHURCH Is IN<br>DANGER.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  'SCOTSMAN'<p>A few&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sundays  ago, a Reverend Divine going to do<br>duty for a neighbouring incumbent, at a viliage not<br>many miles from the metropolis, was followed by a faith-<br>ful dog. on discovering which to avoid what happened,<br>he had his faithful follower, as he thought, safely secur-<br>ed by the side of his horse in the stable. In the course<br>of the service, however, Rover contrived to make his<br>escape, and made his way into the Church to attend<br>his master, who had just ascended the pulpit. placing<br>his paws and head upon the cushion in token of his<br>satisfaction, to the no small dismay of the of the<br>preacher, and amusement of the tittering congregation.<p>JAMES BROWN, PRINTER, EDINBURGH.</p>
