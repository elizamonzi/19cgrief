	<p> Martin's Wonderful Prophecies!<p>RELATING TO&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <p>England, Scotland, and  Ireland.<p>With an Account of the Wonderful Changes that must shortly<br>take place in the Government, and in the State and Condition<br>of the People.<p>HAVING devoted many years to the  study of human events, and been an atten-<br>tive observer of what has been passing in Europe, particularly in Great<br>Britain, and its dependencies, I am thereby enabled to calculate, from what has<br>happened, and the perfect configuration of political affairs, What shall eventually<br>happen, and must shortly come to pass, as materially affecting the interest and hap-<br>piness  of the people under the British Government. In the course of my journeyings<br>through the wildernesss of this world, what strange scenes have I witnessed, and what<br>reverses of fortune have I suffered ! I have enjoyed prosperty, and suffered adver-<br>sity, more, perhaps, than has fallen to the lot of many persons. From these how-<br>ever, I have learned wisdom?been  in ored in the ways  of Providence to mankind,<br>and instructed by the vices and follies of erring mortals.<p>The revolution of seasons?the rise and fall of  Kings? the prosperity and adversity<br>of empires?the fends of party,  and ravages of war  have been carried on with little<br>intromission, in almost every country in the habitual globe.  All  these I have wit- <br>nessed, and not more than  outlived them.<p>I paused here and went to bed; in the midst of a comtemplation, I was weighting  <br>in my mind what was  the cause of all these wars, and the numerous evils which em-<br>bittered the life of man. I had recourse to the Bible,, where I found all those things<br>as plainly as if they had taken place at the time the writers were penning them-- even <br>the last of power, the pride and ambition of  Governers. I  closed  my eyes  for  sleep-<br>when lo ! a vision appeared, and thus addressed me :-"Far greater things than<br>those you have been contemplating will shortly take place. ENGLAND, after<br>having lavished her millions upon surrounding nation, will be forced herslf to seek<br>relief?no power will he found hospitable  enough to satisfy her request?her manu-<br>facures shall fail, there being no demand for them, and the seat of commerce shall<br>be removed beyond the Atlantic sea?divisions  will take place in the council of the<br>nation as to the best mode of saving it from bankruptcy?a bill will be passed to<br>abolish all credit-many merchants and tradesmen will be ruined. the poor labourinng<br>people will suffer severely, and&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;many will die of hunger and starvation ; after which,<br>a new system of things will take place, England will again shine forth in all the<br>splendour of noon-day.<p>IRELAND, long the seat of disaffection, shall be relieved from its present dis-<br>tress, and enabled, by cultivation of its soil, to maintain its own people, without<br>being obliged to allow her sons to emigrate to other countries, to take employment<br>from them who have not enough for themselves nor eat the bread of others, while<br>their own country, so amply fitted to produeced her long sought for claims, will be<br>restored, and her sons enjoy all the privileges which Protestants, at present ;receive:<br>she will not be allowed to emerge back to her former superstition, but be  brought<br>under the glorious dispensation which is so near at hand, when all sects will be<br>united in one great body.<p>SCOTLAND, the cradle of industry, whose mechanics can challenge Europe for<br>their equal, whose scholars can match the far-famed Greeks, whose orators can com-<br>pete with the cloquent sons of Rome ! thou must also undergo a change; darkness<br>must hover around thee for a season;  thy sons shall be driven from their employ-<br>ment, and be obliged to work for a scanty pittance at labour which they are unac-<br>customed to; thy women and children in humble attire, their food but scanty, they<br>shall cry, there will be no pity !  All thus shall come upon thee for thy abuse of<br>former mercies. For thy numerous transgression  shalt thou meet this punishment,<br>But thou shalt come out these afflictions, and be reinstated in thy former greatness.<p>From the various configurations of the planets, much variety of events may be<br>expected. Some foreign powers, that were thought, to be great friends to one ano-<br>ther, may be expected suddenly to break the league; and they will try, by craft and<br>subtlety, to exasperate those who are now at peace, and make them take a part-<br>Perhaps, however, the death of one or more great potentates, or their ministers,<br>may prevent all this mischief. More preferments may shortly be expected to be<br>conferred on deserving men, both of the legal and ecclesiastical function; and the<br>way is now open for men of all persuasions to via in promoting the interests of their<br>country.<p>Let us hope peace, happiness and prosperity, will attend the British nation; for<br>when was it ever known that war ultimately produced any good to Old England, or<br>to the countries she has professed to assist?  What has been achieved by the late<br>expensive contest? Why, at home an enormous debt! and on the continent of<br>Europe, the restoration of the ancient governments, with all their absurdities, ty-<br>ranny and blasting influence...standing monuments of disgrace to the age we live<br>in; and powerful barriers to the principal improvements that can give dignity to<br>man, or raise him to that eminence in the sphere of his existence which he was<br>designed to occupy by his Great Creator.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When contending princes fight,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For private pique, or public right,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Armies are rais'd, the fleets are mann'd,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They combat both by sea and land ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When, after many bottles past,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Both, tir'd with blows, make peace at last;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is it, after all, the people get ?<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why, taxes, widows, wooden legs and debt!<br>The vision immediately fled?a cold sweat covered my body?this may appear<br>wonderful as prophets have ceased, and may be considered by the learned as a fit<br>of delirium or a dream: the reader may rely that none of these circutmstances de-<br>oeited me, as these events will take place in your own day, and be confirmed by<br>your own experience,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(Price One Penny)</p>
