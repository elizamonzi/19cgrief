	<h2>Transcription</h2>
	<p> A particular account of the proceedings&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of the Circuit-Court of<p>Justiciary, which was opened at Glasgow on Wednesday the 11th<p>of April, with the sentence of the different criminals.<p>On Wednesday the 11th of April 1798, the<br>Circuit-Court of Justiciary was opened at<br>Glasgow, by the Right  Honourable the Lord<br>Justice Clerk and Lord Craig, the Court being<br>constitute in the usual manner.<p>Isabella Perston, a weaver's daughter in the pa-<br>rish of Cambuslang, was put to the bar, accused<br>of the murder of  her own bastard child ; the In-<br>dictment being read, she pleaded not guilty, at<br>the same time a petition was presented to the<br>Court, craving banishment; after advising the<br>same, and some favourable circumstances, the<br>Advocate-depute consented, when the Court<br>passed  sentence, banishing her furth of Scotland<br>for life, after the l0th day of May next, with<br>certification, if she returned, she was to be trans-<br>mitted from County to County, till brought to<br>Glasgow, and there publicly whipped through<br>the streets on the next Wednesday after, and<br>again to banish herself: and this so often as she<br>returned.<p>William Gordon, spirit-dealer, indicted for<br>theft and shop-breaking, was then called upon; <br>but he falling to appear, sentence of outlawry<br>was pronounced against him.<p>John M'Millan, confectioner and spirit-dealer,<br>was afterwards put to the bar,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;accused of  the<br>murder of Alexander Moodie, gardener, in Glas-<br>gow,  about six years and a half  ago, when he<br>made his escape,  but being  lately taken up at<br>London, he was transmitted to Glasgow to stand<br>his trial, the Indictment being read, he pleaded<br>not guilty, the Court then asked him, if he had<br>any counsel to conduct his trial, he answered he<br>had none, the Court then appointed Mr. Millar,<br>Professor of Law, in the University of Glasgow,<br>as his Advocate,  when they proceeded to the<br>examination of witnesses.<p>The first witness being sworn, and purged of<br>malice and partial connsel, was asked if he knew<br>the prisoner: he made answer, He did ; and be-<br>ing interrogate what he knew about the murder<br>of Alexander Moodie ? he said he was called in-<br>to the house of M'Millan to see if an account or<br>receipt was right, when he found Mr. Moodie<br>sitting on one side of the table, and M'Millan<br>on the other, and  being shown the paper, he said<br>he thought it was very right: on which Alexan-<br>der Moodie wanted payment, but M'Millan made<br>some objections: on which Moodie said he would<br>call him before a Magistrate to-morrow, on<br>which M'Millian fell into a great passion, and rose<br>and went towards a press when M'Millan's wife<br>exclaimed, John, what are you about? on which<br>the witness left the house in a fright, along with<br>another man then in the house: that they re-<br>turned in less than an hour, when they found<br>several people in the house, and Alexander<br>Moodie lying in his blood and dead, but M'Mil-<br>lan had absconded.<p>The next witness called, agreed with the for-<br>mer, and that he had left the house and returned<br>with the preceding witness: there were several<p>other witnesses called particularly to indentify<br>the person of M'Millan.--The Doctor who<br>inspected the body of Moodie said, the wound<br>was between eight and nine inches deep through<br>part of the heart and lungs.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<p>The proof being closed, the Advocate-depute<br>for the Crown, summed up the evidence to the<br>Jury in a pathetic and masterly manner;  he ob-<br>ferved, that though this murder had been com-<br>mitted at no less time than six years and a half<br>ago, and the murderer residing 400 miles dis-<br>taoce, yet Providence had brought him to be<br>tried, and suffer where he had committed the<br>murder.--Mr. Millar then addressed the Jury<br>for the pannel.<p>Lord Justice Clerk then charged the Jury, in<br>which he pointed out the clearness of the evi-<br>dence; and observed, that though none of the<br>witnesses had sworn positively to seeing the mur-<br>der committed, yet the circumstances were so<br>clear, that they were equal to positive evidence;<br>he also made some excellent observations, of the<br>Almighty so over-ruling circumstances that mur-<br>derers seldom escaped ; and though a long time<br>had intervened since this murder was commit-<br>ted, yet he is brought to fulfill that saying,<br>" Whosoever sheddeth man's blood, by man shall<br>his blood be shed," The Jury were ordered to<br>inclose and return their verdict to-morrow at<br>ten o'clock : to which time the Court adjourn-<br>ed ; they rose about five o'clock.<p>On Thursday the Court met according to<br>adjournment, when John M'Millan was put to<br>the bar, and the Jury having given in their ver-<br>dict, and being read by the Clerk of Court,<br>which was being unanimous in finding the pan-<br>nel Guilty ; but delayed passing sentence till Fri-<br>day eleven o'clock.<p>David Wilson, weaver, in Paisley, was then<br>brought to the bar, and the Indictment being<br>read, accusing him of being guilty of a great num-<br>ber of articles, of taking out webs to work from<br>a number of Manufacturers both in Paisley and<br>Glasgow, under a number of different names,<br>and embazzelling the same, or applying them to<br>his own use; also of several acts of theft in steal-<br>ing yarn, &c. to all which he pleaded Guilty, and<br>having signed his acknowledgement, the Court<br>restricted the libel, and the Jury was then inclos-<br>ed, and ordered to return their verdict as soon<br>as they could, who returned their verdict<br>in half an hour, by finding him guilty by his<br>judicial confession. The Court delayed pro-<br>nouncing sentence till to-morrow eleven o'clock.<p>Before the Court adjourned, Lord Craig ad-<br>dressed the audience, exhorting them to be sub-<br>missive to the laws of their country ;- and re-<br>presented in the strongest light, the many acts of<br>cruelty, oppression, and disorder, the French na-<br>tion had been guilty of, and hoped they would<br>be united in resisting an inveterate and impla-<br>cable foe, &c.<p>Friday the Court met at eleven o'clock, according to appointment, when John M'Millan was again<br>brought to the bar to receive sentence: which was that he be carried back to prison, and fed on<br>bread and water only, until the 16th day of May next, and between the hours of two and four that<br>day to be taken to the common place of execution, and hung by the neck till he be dead, his body<br>afterwards to be given to the Professor of Anatomy for dissection,--David Wilson was then brought<br>to the bar, and received sentence, which was to remain in the tolbooth of Glasgow two months<br>from this date; and the next Wednesday to stand on the Pillory, from twelve to one, at the Cross<br>of Glasgow, and afterwards to be detained other two months in prison, and then set at liberty.</p>
