	<p> FIGHT<p>Which took place at the Dumbie-Dykes, on<br>Friday morging, between a Tailor and<br>Clothier and a Coachman, in respectable<br>family in the New Town, originating in<br>their pretentions to  the hand of a handsome<br>Lady's-maid living in the same street.<p>Mr C?------- had long cherished a secret<br>penchant for the beautiful and accomplished<br>Miss lucy Martin, and was only prevented<br>from declaring his passion and throwing him-<br>self at the feet of his adored by a retiring<br>modesty towards the fair object of his affec-<br>tions, mixed up with a soul-harrowing dread<br>lest his Profession as a Tailor should operate-<br>as an insuperable bar in the eye of his<br>angelic Madona to anything like a re-<br>turn of his ardent flame. Jem the dashing<br>choachee of an adjoining house, had also cast<br>a sheep's eye towards the fair object of the<br>Tailor's fond regard;  and, on a late occasion,<br>at a convival party by a jovial butler, a mu.<br>tual friend of the aspiring swains, Coachee<br>thought proper evultingly to toast off a bum-<br>per to the health his fair dulcinea. This<br>liberty taken by Jehu with the idol of his<br>soul, so enraged honest Stichie that high<br>words ensued between them, which was<br>quickly followed by a blow from the dexter<br>hand of our hero of the whip, which drew<br>claret from the proboscis of the man of Cloth<br>who forthwith floored his opponent by a re-<br>mendous hit on potato-trap. A regular pll-<br>mell would now have commenced; but, for<br>the sake of the house, order was re-establish -<br>ed by their kind entertainer, and prelimin-<br>aries immediately arranged for settled the<br>matter by a regular STAND-UP FIGHT.<p>Both men appeared on the ground at the<br>appointed time;?the Tailor being seconded<br>by Tim, the flesher, and Jem by Jarvis, a<br>brother chip. A ring having been formed.<br>both stripped and went to work.<p>Round 1. Both men showed some science ;<br>they sparred for some minutes, when the<br>Stichie come down by a left hander upon his<br>knowledge-box.<p>Rounds 2 & 3. Good fighting ; the Tailor<br>jobbed cleverly, and threw down his man.<p>Round 4. Jem catched it on his dexter<br>ogle, which made it blush like a full blown<br>rose. In a close both fell, Jem upper.<p>Rounds 5, 6, 7, & 8. Lively work ; tiddy<br>tipping on both sides ; good game shown,<br>but coachie getting weak, and floored each<br>time.<p>Rounds 9 & 10. Counter jobbing ; Jem's<br>pepper-box shewed ocular demonstrations of<br>heavy work from his adversary.<p>From Round 10 to 14, it was evident that<br>the Tailor had it all his own way, as Jem<br>was getting weaker and weaker ; but he still<br>shewed pluck. The two last rounds lasted<br>only a few seconds, and Jem was taken off<br>by his suppoaters in a state of great ex-<br>haustion, having shewn game to the last.<p>Brown, Printer, Edinburgh.</p>
