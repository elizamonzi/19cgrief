	<p> A Full and Particular Account of the<p>EXECUTION<p>Of  FIVE WHITEBOYS, who were Hanged at Newcastle, in the<br> County of Limerick,on Monday the 7th January, 1822. Also,<br>their Address from the Scaffold to their deluded fellow-country-<br>men. With an account of their funeral procession from the place of<br>Execution to the Croppies Hole, where they were buried by the<br>Public Authorities. <p>(From the Limerick Chronicle.).<p>ON Monday morning, 7th January, at eight<br>o'clock, Thomas Kelly, Michael Kiely,<br>Timothy Shea, John Histon, and John Mul-<br>lane, who were convicted at the Commission,<br>of offences under the Whiteboy Act, and order-<br>ed for execution, were taken from the county<br>jail on cars, to Newcastle, in the County of<br>Limerick, by an escort of the carabineers, and<br>one hundred men of the 79th, commanded by<br>Lieut.-Colonel Brown, to undergo the awful<br>sentence of the law. They arrived at the place<br>of execution, a field of Mr. Hartnett's, near<br>Newcastle, a little after two o'clock. When<br>the platform was erected, the unfortunate men<br>ascended, attended by their clergy, who, hav-<br>ing previously afforded them spiritual consola-<br>tion, individually exhorted them to make open,<br>free, and full confessions to the surrounding<br>spectasors; and to warn them against the awful<br>delusions which had brought so fatal a result<br>before their eyes.<p>Kelly spoke first?He called upon the pea-<br>santry to listen to the wholesome advice of their<br>clergy, to be obedient to the laws, and to the<br>gentry, and finally to give up the arms, and re-<br>turn to peace and quiet, and resume habits of<br>industry; but denied his guilt pf the crime for<br>which he was was about to suffer.?Shea ac<br>knowledged the justness of his sentence. He<br>called upon all persons concerned with the<br>whiteboys to give up their arms, and to forsake<br>their evil ways, that by a due obedience of the<br> holy doctrines taught by their respective, pas-<br>tors, they might expect forgiveness on earth as<br>well as hereafter in heaven; he also stated, that<br>after his conviction, he had given information<br>against several persons as being implicated with<br>him in whiteboy acts, which, he found himself<br>bound to say, was false; and that he was led in-<br>to such expressions by the vain hope that it<br>would have released him from his unhappy si-<br>tuation; he pronounced all the persons he had<br>heretofore named as perfectly innocent of his<br>charge. Kiely addressed the populace in Irish,<br>which he spoke fluently; he said he was not<br>guilty of the charge for which he was about to<br>die?that he was engaged with the disaffected<br>people of the country about 2O years ago, and<br>also in the disturbances which occurred about<br>eight years back, but that having a  knowledge<br>of the results of those periods, and clearly see-<br>ing the folly of pursuing such conduct any lon-<br>ger, he had Always exerted himself in advising<br>the people of the present day to give up their<p>pursuit, as it would only end in the way which<br>was then presented to their view; he said his<br>real name was Kelly, not Keily ?Histon fully<br>acknowledged his crime, and also freely ad-<br>mitted that he did belong to the nightly depre-<br>dators, whom he called upon, as they valued<br>the happiness of their families and friends, to<br>give up their arms, and lead quiet and peacea-<br>ble lives in future, which was the only means<br>within their power to compensate for the crimes<br>which they had committed.?Mullane (who<br>appeared an idiot) declared in Irish his inno-<br>cence, that he never took arms, and did not<br>know what they were.<p>After the unfortunate men had severally ad-<br>dressed the populace (who had all been suffered<br>to approach within the military lines, by Mr.<br>Cuthburt, sub-sheriff, and whose number might<br>be estimated at about 1500 only) the Rev. Mr.<br>Fitzgerald, in the most solemn manner, exhort-<br>ed the people upon the awful examples then<br>about tb take place; five human beings standing<br>on the brink of eternity, brought to that igno-<br>minious scaffold by the vile counsel of those<br>whose mandates they have fulfilled; and per-<br>haps some of those very persons who have thus<br>immolated their fellow mortals at the shrine of<br>vicious purposes at this moment silent specta-<br>tors of those miserable victims. If such are<br>presents, what must be their feelings, what re-<br>paration could they make to an offended God,<br>and to upright laws so violently outraged??<br>Turn from their evil ways or that must be<br>their fate also.<p>Kelly, Keily, and Shea were then launched<br>into eternity; Histon and Mullane in about<br>half an hour after. They had all changed this<br>mortal scene before 4 o'clock, and after hanging<br>the usual time, their respective families were<br>permitted to take down the bodies, and to in-<br>dulge in their feelings, the exhibition of which<br>was truly affecting.<p>The bodies were then placed in cars, and the<br>cavalcade returned to Rathkeale, where they<br>stopped, leaving the cars, during the night,<br>near the sessions-house, under the care of a<br>military guard; and on Tuesday they were,<br>brought into this city, and interred in a place<br>called Croppies' Hole, at the back of the county<br>jail, with quick lime. The appearance of the<br>dead bodies on the cars had a dreadful effect<br>and was sufficient in itself to strike terror into<br>the minds of the country people as they passed<br>along the road.<p>John Muir, Printer, Glasgow. </p>
