	<p> Execution.<p>A full and  particular account of the<br>Execution of John Wilson and Duncan<br>Fraser, this day 28th January,for break-<br>ing into a shop in St. Mary's Wynd,<br>with an account of their behaviour in<br>Jail and at the place of Execution.<p>Edinburgh, Jan. 28, 1824 This day were Executed pursuant<br>to their sentence, John Wilson and Duncan Frazer, for breaking<br>into a Tailors Shop, in St. Mary's Wynd, and stealing sundry<br>articles of wearing Apparel; they both pled guilty at their trial.<p>These unfortunate young men have been exceedingly restless<br>since the other convict, Douglas, (who was sentenced to be Ex-<br>ecuted along with them for the crime of highway robbery,) got<br>a respite. In consequence of this unlocked for extension of the<br>Royal clemency, Wilson and Frazer, it seems, entertained a hope<br> that it might also be extended to them, considering their own<br>crimes as of a less atrocious character than that of Douglas.<br>This hope Wilson particularly continued to indulge till Wedne-<br>esday morning last, the 21st, when he gave himself up to a state<br>bordering on despair, uttering horrid imprecations, and vehement-<br>ly declaring that force alone should drag him from his cell to the<br>place of execution. It is hoped, however, that the exhortations<br>of the clergymen who Visited him brought him to a temper of<br>mind more suitable to his awful situation.<p>Expectation were generally entertained that the place of exe-<br>cution would be changed  prior  these unfortunate  men's  awful<br>exit, but at a meeting of the town council,  it was decided that no<br>alteration  at the  present time  would  take place.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The  scaffold<br>was, as usual, erected last night at the head of Libberton's Wynd.<br>This morning crowds collected very early, and took their stances<br>as near to the scaffold as the guard would permit,  and a continu-<br>ed movement  and noise reigned until the unhappy victims made<br>their appearance, when a dead  silence prevailed,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They were re-<br>moved from the  Calton-hill Jail  on Tuesday afternoon  about 4<br>o'clock, (previous  to leaving  the jail; they parted  for the  last<br>time with  their relations,)  in a carriage,  which landed  opposite<br>the Court-door in the Parliament Square, by which the prisoners<br>were conveyed into the Lock up-house.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the morning when<br>  the  clergymen and magistrates arrived,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;they were  brought into<br>the hall,and seemed to pay attention to a most feeling and path-<br>etic  prayer  delivered&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;by one  of the  clergymen.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After  eight<br>o'clock struck,  they prepared to&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;move to the  scaffold; the ex-<br>Iutioner  appeared and&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;pinioned thir arms, and&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;about a quarter <br> before nine they proceeded to the fatal spot,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They joined in the<br>religious  duties with great fervour.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Before mounting the drop,<br>Frazer  came forward  to the front of  the scaffold  and addressed<br>the multitude  in nearly the  following words, Good People, take<br>warning by our  untimely end.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Refrain  from Sabbath-breaking,<br>and the company of bad women,  drinking and swearing, which<br>have been ruin,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; God be with you all,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They then  ascended the<br>drop with fortitude,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and a quarter past nine they were launched<br>into eternity.<p> They ware both young men. and belonged to Edinburgh.<br>Frazer was brought up in the Castle-hill, and Wilson in the West<br>Bow; and, we believe, no blame can be attached to the<br>parents of these unfortunate young men, who, we under-<br>stand used every endeavour to check them in their wicked carreer,<br>they at times flattered, at others threatened, but it had no otther<br>effect than making them absent themselves from under their<br>parent's roof, and associate with those who by their bad exam<br>ple have brought them to this untimely end. Wilson's father<br>on the morning of their trial, wrote a most feeling letter, ad-<br>dressed to the Lord Justice Clerk.<p>It would, have been thought that the many examples made,<br>and the sure fate of the above two, would have thrown a damp-<br>ness over the twenty-two convicts that were sent away on Thurs-<br>day last, the most of whom having narrowly escaped the same<br>fate, but instead of that, their minds were premediating the mur-<br>der of one of the turnkeys and effect their escape ; their deadly<br>weapon was a table knife, made sharp in the point and the back,<br>fortunately the horrid plot was discovered, and the weapon tak-<br>en from them; they were considered the most hardened and<br>mischievous set that have ever been within the walls of the jail. <p>Edinburgh, Printed for the Booksellers.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  </p>
