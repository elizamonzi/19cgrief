	<p> My Big Wig all so<br>Mealy and White.<p>A NEW SONG.<p>Sung, without much applause, on several late occasions,<br>by his, Majesty's Attorney-General.<p>TUNE?The Black Joke.<p>PLAIN JOHN is my name, though they've made me Sir John,<br>A straight-forward man, when I have not got on<br>My big wig all so mealy and white.<br>I lately have heard of your city's distress,<br>And feeling my own, I could scarcely do less<br>Than lay down my briefs, and thus haste to your aid<br>Well knowing your love for our plain spoken trade,<br>With our big wigs all so mealy and white.<p> I'm a STRANGER among you, 'tis all very true,<br>Yet, if you'll consider, what else could I do<br>For my big wig all so mealy and white ?<br>I was kicked out of DUDLEY some few weeks ago,<br>And, ere I had time to recover the blow,<br>I was civilly told by those masters of mine,<br>" You must find a new seat or your office resign,<br>With your big wig all so mealy and white!"<p>Where was I to go then an opening to seek ?<br>Whom could I apply to except to THE CLIQUE,<br>With their small wigs all so mealy and white?<br>They always are ready to help out a friend,<br>And, if he's a PLACEMAN, their zeal has no end;<br>They always (God bless them) have members to make,<br>And whatever they do, it is all for your sake,<br>With their small wigs all so mealy and white !<p>I have too little leisure already, by far,<br>For you know, my good friends, I'm the head of our bar,<br>With my big wig all so mealy and white :<br>Yet its common enough in the Courts where I plead<br>To take up a CASE that one never can read ;<br>This perhaps may be called by an awkwardish name,<br>Yet its perfectly common, and all quite the same<br>To our big wigs all so mealy and white !<p>I'm all in the dark as to all your affairs,<br>For in fact you have taken me quite unawares,<br>In my big wig all so mealy and white.<br>But supposing I knew them, both " measures and men,<br>Having half a day's leisure to give them?what then ?<br>I'm afraid I should find that it hardly would pay<br>To suffer your business to come in the way<br>Of my big wig all so mealy and white !<p>If any one asks my political creed,<br>I answer, 'tis one which each voter may read<br>In my big wig all so mealy and white.<br>In Church and in State my unchanging belief<br>Is to change with my clients?to look to my brief?<br>And if you elect me, I fairly may boast<br>That it shan't be my fault, if not found in my post<br>With my,big wig all so mealy and white!</p>
