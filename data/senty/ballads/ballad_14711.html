	<h2>Transcription</h2>
	<p> Strange Affair.<p>Particular Account of JOHN WOOD, who is now<br>under sentence of death at Perth, and is to be<br>Executed there on FRIDAY the 16th July,<br>and what is wonderful is to be tried at Edin-<br>burgh the day before his Execution, for another<br>crime, Housebreaking and Theft, and though<br>he should be cleared of the second indictment,<br>he must suffer the day following for his first of-<br>fence, being one of the most singular circum-<br>stances which has ever occurred in Scotland.<p>The above unfortunate young man, who was condemned<br>along with another young man of the name of Donnelly, for<br>Housebreaking and Theft at Perth, at the last Circuit Court<br>of Justiciary there, and were sentenced to be Hanged at Perth<br>on the 4th of June last, and who received a respite of one month,<br>and another for a fortnight, are to be Executed on Friday first,<br>the 16th July, 1824.<p>What makes this case so remarkable, is the fact, that he is<br>to be tried  the day previous to his Execution at Perth, in Edin-<br>burgh, upon au another indictment, charging him with House-<br>breaking and Theft in the house of a respectable Gentleman in<br>the same neighbourhood. The reason for this strange step We<br>are not acquainted with, as the newspapers do not assign the<br>particular motive. They say, that he has been blamed with a<br>departure from the religion of his fathers, which they who<br>have attended him in his devotional exercises positively deny.<br>Be that as it may, any person of common sense would never<br>for a moment suppose that a new trial would be brought for-<br>ward on account of the religious principles which, the man<br>professes; perhaps, it is quite the contrary, and may be done<br>to satisfy both the ends of justice and the prisoner. Let the<br>issue be what it may, it cannot be worse for the prisoner than<br>the punishment he is already doomed to suffer, except the agi-<br>tated state in which it may place him, his end being so near<br>at hand. We believe the whole affair to be nothing more<br>than to fairly investigate the business, and to bring the guilty<br>to that punishment which such a crime merits.<p>Every person will naturally feel for the unfortunate man,<br>for being taken from place to place in this awful situation,<br>but it is infinitely better the case be investigated that it  may<br>appear whether he be innocent or guilty.<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  W.
