	<p> FRIENDSHIP'S BUT<br>A SHADOW.<p>Written and Sung by Mr J. Macguire, with the greatest<br>success.<p>Air?-' English, Welsh and Scotch."<p>This Popular Song can be had at 190 and 192<br>OVERGATE, Dundee.<p>As we journey on through life we meet with many ups and<br>downs,<br>And often wish that we had ne'er been born ;<br>When poverty o'ertakes us in our humble happy home,<br>Our best friends are apt to turn on us with soorn.<br>When fortune seems to favour you they'll meet you with a<br>smile,<br>They will treat you and will see you safely home,<br>But remember what I say or forget it if you may,<br>Your best friend is a shilling of your own.<p>CHORUS?<p>Friendship's but a shadow, the shrewdest can be sold ;<br>Experience has taught me to discern<br>One true friend is better far than half his weight in gold<br>'Tis a lesson we have all some day to learn.<p>When a sailor comes home from some port beyond the seas,<br>His friends will gather round him by the score,<br>The girl he loves so dearly she will grasp him by the hand,<br>And say, "My boy, you are welcome home once more."<br>He lavishes his money on those he deems so true,<br>And his warm and manly heart with joy does swell,<br>But when  his purse is empty, and these friends do seem so<br>cold,<br>How different is the tale he has to tell.<p>The rich man rolls in splendour, whilst the poor man plods<br>along<br>Through all his life in misery and woe,<br>With trouble and with labour he is bent down to the ground,<br>And his hair hangs round his neck as white as snow.<br>He sits alone, and ponders o'er the follies of his youth,<br>And all the friends he had in bye-gone days ;<br>A vision of his boyhood does arise before his eyes,<br>And these are the touching words he says,<p>I don't say for one moment that everyone's alike,<br>But we must be very cautious in those days<br>Impostors are so numerous, 'tis hard to judge a man,<br>They all seem to adopt such winning ways ;<br>There are hearts as true and warm as ever beat on earth.<br>Yet use all the discretion that you can,<br>Take each man to be honest till you prove he is a roguo,<br>And fight you way on bravely like a man.</p>
