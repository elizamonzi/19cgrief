	<p> THE&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; LOSS<p>OF THE<p>PRINCESS ALICE.<p>Tune :?Sailor's Grave.<br>How  many thousands have found a grave<p>eneath the rolling wave,<br>And day by&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;day the list  we swell<br>Another&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; loss&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; we have to tell;<p>Above&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;five&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;hundred precious  lives,<br>Women and children men and wives,<br>In the&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; midst of joy and pleasures'  games,<br>They&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  all were&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;drowned&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; in the river Thames.<p>eneath the&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thames their bodies lie,<br>Both old and young were doom'd to die,<br>The Steamer sank beneath the wave.<br>And hundreds found a watery grave,<br>To Sheerness they had been that day,<br>Eight hundred souls how sad to say,<br>Returning home with hearts so light,<br>Through the darkness of the night.<br>They met a vessel on the way,<br>At the close of that eventful day,<br>The "Princess Alice " she was run down,<br>Opposite to Woolwich town.<br>Eight hundred souls were in the waves,<br>Struggling against a watery grave,<br>The old and young both were there,<br>Feeble age and youth so fair.<br>Women with children on their breast,<br>In death's embrace they sank to rest,<br>Many a man how sad to say,<br>Lost all he loved that fatal day.<br>The screams were heard on Woolwich shore,<br>Of those who sank to rise no more,<br>Down in the Thames' cold watery bed,<br>Above five hundred were lying dead.<br>Just before, they were full of life,<br>The husband sitting beside his wife,<br>Their little children by their side,<br>Now all were drown'd beneath the tide.<br>They had no time for the humble prayer,<br>Destruction soon was reigning there,<br>The waters caught each fleeting breath,<br>One minute in life, the next in death.<br>Their pleasure came to a fearful end,<br>No-one on earth relief could send.<br>Their time was come for them to die,<br>God bless them all now dead they lie.<br>What must the feeling of relations be.<br>Waiting and expecting friends to see,<br>Little thinking they were drowned,<br>Or that such a fearful death they'd found. <br>We all shall think of them I'm sure,<br>And prayfor&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;thembe they rich or poor,<br>History will record the names,<br>Of those who were drown'd in the riverThames.<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;THE&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; PARROT<p>AND THE<p> OLD ARM CHAIR.<p>PARODY ON THE " OLD ARM CHAIR."<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  My girl invited me one Sunday home to tea,<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Her Pa and Ma had gone out for the day,<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  Not feeling disinclined I said I didn't mind,<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With the girl I loved to pass the time away,<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So on Sunday changed my clothes, and then says I,<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;here goes,<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And straightway to her house I did repair,<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  While looking for a seat I heard a voice repeat,<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You can sit down in the Old Arm Chair.<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  I heard you kiss her and heard you chaff,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I heard you tickle her and make her laugh,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I heard what you said I positively swear,<p>I see what you was doing in the Old Arm Chair.<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; T was a parrot that I heard a very knowing bird,<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And soon my girl she took the bird away<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  I then began to laugh, the girl began to chff,<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  And said it's been a bother all the day,<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  But as I sit at my ease, with my girl upon my knees,<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I got so wild I could have torn my hair,<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You had better let me be, for I can plainly see,<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What you're doing in the Old Arm Chair.<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  Scarce knowing what to do I said to darling Lee,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  For two pins I would take the parrot's life,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  Oh, don't, dear John, said she, if you so cruel be,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  I shall never be your darling wife;<p> I heard just what she said, and she gently laid her<br>head<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Upon my arm, and lightly smoothed my hair,<p>When in the old man popp'd and caught me'on the<p>hop,<br>With his daughter in the Old Arm Chair.<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now very soon I found myself upon the ground,<br>And darling Loo was stretched upon the floor,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And I found to my surprise he'd blackened both my<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;eyes,<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  And swore I shouldn't come there any more;<p>When her mother heard of this she said you naught;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  Miss,<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The parrot told us all I do declare,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You shouldn't let him in then Polly  said with a grin,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I see you in the Old Arm Chair.</p>
