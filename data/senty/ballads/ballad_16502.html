	<p> FREEDOM<p>AND<p>LEARMONTH<p>MUST CARRY THE DAY!!<p>A NEW SONG.<p>TUNe?" Lillibulero,' &c.<p>I.<p>All honest electors of this our fair town,<br>Come listen to me, and I plainly will shew<br>How an impudent Lawyer, with wig and with gown,<br>By a good man and true, shall soon be laid low?<br>John Learmonth's the man<br>To defeat each vile plan,<br>In his quiet, unprentending, yet resolute way,<br>For in their tricks,<br>We will beat them to sticks,<br>And freedom and Learmonth will carry the day.<p>II.<p>If they call him " a tradesman," I merely reply,<br>That his is a belter and honester trade<br>Than a lawyer, whose life's one perpetual lie,<br>And who sports just the conscience for which he is paid.<br>They may try to be droll<br>On  his place at the pole,<br>And many smart things of the sort they may say,<br>Yet there's no one but feels<br>That we're now " upon wheels,"<br>And that freedom and Learmonth must carry the day,<p>III.<p>He is ONE or OURSELVES, and has all his life been,<br>So that all can his talents and virtues declare;<br>And if at your leisure you walk t'wards the Dean,<br>You will see what a Bridge he has built for us there;<br>Your men of the law,<br>With their jabber and jaw,<br>May be all well enough in their own roguish way;<br>But they'll talk for some time,<br>Ere they " beat stone and lime,"<br>So Improvement and Learmonth must carry the day.<p>IV.<p>At the old burgh system, the CLIQUE used to rail,<br>Yet now that at last from that scourge we are free,<br>They would fain make us o'er by a sort of entail,<br>To a junto of lawyers to hold us fee.<br>But GIBSON & Co.,<br>To their sorrow shall know,<br>That this is a trade which no longer will pay,<br>And it now shall be shewn,<br>We've a man of our own,<br>And that freedom and Learmonth must carry the day.<p>V.<p>Their English Attorney, with forehead of brass,<br>Who's been kicked here from Dudley will scarce do<br>for me,<br>Why, 'tis worse than the days of old William Dundas !<br>Far worse than the tricks of the old thirty-three!!!<br>No, no, Sir James, no,<br>We're not quite so low<br>As to welcome each minion of Althorp or Grey?<br>Your old Duds, 'tis clear,<br>Will never do here,<br>And true blue and Learmonth must carry the day.<p>VI.<p>Then Learmonth forever ! and down with the Clique<br>Who have sucked us so long, but have now lost their<br>hold,<br>And who (as the song says) " tho' at their last squeak,<br>Still would treat us like Gatton or Sarum of old!"<br>Johu Learmonth's the man,<br>Who in liberty's van<br>Goes forward as smoothly as on a railway;<br>And Dudley, 'tis clear,<br>Will be left in the rear,<br>While freedom aad Learmonth will carry the day !</p>
