	<p> an account of the Trial of ROBERT BROwN ANDERSON, and JAMES MENZIES, alias Ro-<br>BERTSON, before the Circuit Court of Justiciary at Stirling, for Shop-breaking and Theft,<br>at Grahamstown, near Falkirk, who were sentenced is be executed at Stirling, on. Friday<br>the 11th of october, 1811.<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;STIRLING, SEPTEMBER 9,<br>THE&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Circuit Court  of Justiciary was<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;opened here on Saturday last, by the<br>Right Honourable Lord Hermand.<p>Robert Cochnan, sawyer in Alloa, indict-<br>ed for forging and vitiating documents of<br>debt, was outlawed for not appearing.<p>The Court then proceeded to the trial of<br>Robert Brown Anderson, and James Men-<br>zies, or Robertson, prisoners in Stirling jail,<br>accused of breaking into the shop of James<br>[  ell, merchant in Grahamston, near Fal-<br>kirk on the night of Saturday the 23d of<p>February last, and stealing therefrom a cask<br>of brandy, two chests of tea, a drawer con-<br>taining copper coin, and a loaf of sugar<p>John Burns, changekeeper in .Falkirk,<br>Elizabeth Williams, his wife, and Alexander<br>Logan, changekeeper in Denny, were in-<br>cluded in the same indictment, for resetting<br>the said goods, knowing the same to have<br>been stolen. The trial lasted till Sunday<br> morning; and this day the Jury returned a<br>verdict, by a plurality of voices finding the<p>  libel proven against Anderson and Menzies,<br>but recommended them to mercy.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Unani-<br>mously finding Burns and his wife Guilty;<p>and by a plurality of voices Not Proven a-<br>gainst Logan. Anderson and Menzies were<br>sentenced to be executed here on the 11th of<br>october next. Burns and his wife to be<br>transported for 14 years, and Logan was<br>assoilzied and dismissed from the bar.<p>The Court were next occupied with the<br>trial of Thomas Coventry, for the forgery of<br>a bill of L.30. At the conclusion of the<br>evidence, the Advocate-Depute restricted the<br>libel to an arbitrary punishment, and the Jury<br>returned a verdict, finding the libel Proven.<br>He received sentence of transportation for<br>seven years.<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;AYR, SEPTEMBER  12.<br> The&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Circuit  Court&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Justiciary  was<br>opened here, on Friday, by the Right Ho-<br> nourable Lord Justice Clerk and Lord Ar-<p>madale.<p> The Court were occupied during the<br> greater part of that day with the trial of<br>Alexander Kerr, sen. and Alexander Ker,<br>jun. Archibald Cook, James Nichol, and<br>John Murphy, indicted for the crimes of<br>assaulting and deforcing certain of the Ayr<br>Customhouse Officers.<p>The general facts libelled were distinctly<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  sworn to by  James Campbell,  tidewaiter,<br>as affecting all the prisoners, and by John<p>Taylor, tidewaiter, as affecting three of<br>them, with the addition of the specific facts<br>committed by Archibald Cook and Alexan-<br>der Ker, jun. in knocking him down, and<br>kicking and trampling on him. The evi-<br>dence on the part of the prosecution being<br>closed, and some exculpatory witnesses ex-<br>amined, William Boswell, Esq. Advocate-<br>Depute, addressed the Jury in a short ener-<br>getic speech, in which he maintained that<br>it was abundantly clear that all the pannels<br>had been engaged in the smuggle, and that<br>three of them had been guilty of the assault<br>and deforcement?and by james Ferguson,<br>Esq. senior Counsel for the prisoneis, who<br>employed much ingenuity in endeavouring;<br>to show, that the evidence had completely<br>failed, inresect to Alexander Ker, sen. and<br>John Murphy, and that it was defective in<br>as far as it related to the identifying of the<br>other three. After which his Lordship short-<br>ly summed up the evidence, and stated that<br>it came completely home to the pannels<br>Alex. Ker, jun. Archibald Cook, and James<br>Nichol. The Jury returned a verdict on<br>Saturday morning of Guilty against the said<br>Alex. Ker, jun. Archd. Cook, and James<br>Nichol, and of Not Proven in the case of<br>Alex. Ker, sen. and John Murphy, upon<br>which these two last were dismissed from the<br>Bar, with a suitable admonition from the<br>Lord Justice Clerk, who pointed out to them<br>in forcible language the illegality of smug-<br>gling, with respect to the revenue and the<br>fair trader, the guilt to which it frequently<br>led, and the dangerous conlequences with<br>which it was often followed.<p>Alex. Ker, jun. Archd. Cook, and James<br>Nichol, were sentenced to fix months' Jm-<br>prisonment, and to seven years' banishment<br>from Scotland.<p>Afterwards John Armstrong, sometime<br>sailar on board the Helena, of Workington,<br>was brought to the Bar, accused of the crime<br>of Rape; but no evidence having been ad-<br>duced to identify his person, during the<br>commission of the crime, the Jury returned<br>a verdict, finding the libel Not Proven; and<br>he was, therefore, dismissed from the Bar,<br>after a most feeling and impressive admoni-<br>tion from Lord Armadale.<p>The Public Prosecutor not considering<br>himself justified in proceeding with the trial<br>of John Grafs, indicted for Murder, on ac-<br>count of the absence of some material wit-<br>nesses, deserted the diet pro loco et tempore.<p>Printed by T. dunoan, 159, Saltmarket.</p>
