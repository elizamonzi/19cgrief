	<p> THE KNIGHT TEMPLAR'S DREAM.<p>As Morpheus my senses in slumber did drown,<br>I dreamt I was climbing Horeb, a holy mound,<br>Where Moses was chosen Grand Master in love,<br>By the Great Architect, for the great lodge above.<p>With trembling, fear, and wonder, I stood all in amaze,<br>To see a bush a burning all by a mighty blaze.<br>My bones they did shudder, quite feeble was my frame.<br>When a dreadful fiery serpent right forward to me came.<p>I looked on death approaching, with terror, dread, and grief,<br>And called then on goodness to grant me some relief,<br>Unto my great astonishment, a voice unto me said,<br>Come take up the serpent and do not be afraid,<p>I looked all around me, and put my trust in God,<br>I then engaged the serpent, and it soon became a rod,<br>A rod  in bud and blossom with variegated hue.<br>That Moses smote the waters with, and led his brethren through.<p>I then became a pilgrim, to travel night and day,<br>I took the rod of God with me to guide me on the way,<br>Over rugged mountains hound for the temple bright,<br>Till I came into Jemsalem that city of delight.<p>I saw the knights of Malta enshining arms bright,<br>Surround the  sons of darkness that cast away the light,<br>The flushed feathered pheasant  that gave the signal call,<br>When Peter he denied the Redeemer of us all.<p>There were many war-like hereoes that struck me with surprise,<br>Until a greater wonder approached my ravished eyes,<br>A grand illumination before me there appeared<br>With an ancient warrior that wore a dreadful beard.<p>His robs were long and beautiful and rich with honour glowed,<br>A regal helmet on his head of gold all his honour showed,<br>Twelve dazzling stars of lustre all on his royal breast,<br>With the sword of justice in his hand with sparkling gems & crest.<p>He enlisted me as a soldier to fight for Christian Liberty,<br>Against the Turks and heathens, and all idolatry,<br>To all our faithful battles Jehovah lent a hand,<br>To Gideon brave and Joshua that caused the sun to stand.<p>Through Sharon's lovely valley, and great Mount Gerizlim high<br>Mount Caivary lay mourning as I was passing by,<br>I crossed the river Jordan, and Jericho likewise,<br>To lovely mount Zion where sweet odours scent the skies.<p>I travelled through Mount Arrarat and fair Armenia's land,<br>From that to Enoch's temple where I saw two pillars grand,<br>The one was malble in the east the other brazon pure,<br>With a carved stone of Jasper that closed up the door.<p>I tinkled at the Jasper door, admittance there I sought,<br>Through many coloured arches till I found the secret vault,<br>With torches burning round me in one continued blaze,<br>Where I saw the mystery and on it carefully gazed.<p>I fell upon my knees and offered up a prayer,<br>To all goodness and mercy with fervency and oare,<br>Unto my great astonishment two fiery dragons came,<br>And in the height of my astonishment I woke out of my dream<p>KILLARNEY'S<p>LAKES<p>AND<p>FELLS.<p>By Killarney's lakes and fells,<br>Emerald isles and winding bays,<br>Mountain paths and woodland dells,<br>Memory ever foundly strays.<br>Bounteous nature loves all lands,<br>Beauty wanders everywhere,<br>Footprints leaves on many strands,<br>But her home is surely there.<br>Angels fold their wings and rest<br>In that Eden of the West?<br>Beauty's home, Killarney !<br>Heaven's reflex, Killarney!<p>No place else can charm the eye<br>With such bright and varied tints;<br>Every rock that you pass by,<br>Verdure broiders or besprints.<br>Virgin there the green grass grows;<br>Every morn Spring's natal day;<br>Bright-hued berries daff the snows,<br>Smiling Winter's frown away.<br>Angels often pausing there,<br>Doubt if Eden were more fair,<br>Beauty's home, Killarney !<br>Heaven's reflex, Killarney!&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <p>Music there where Echo dwells,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  <br>Makes each sound a harmony;<br>Many-voiced the chorus swells,<br>Till it faints in ecstasy.<br>With the charmful tints below,<br>Seems the heavens above to vie;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>All rich colours that we know<br>Tinge the cloud-wreaths in that sky.<br>Wings of angels so wight shine,<br>Glancing back soft light divine?<br>Beauty's home, Killamey!<br>Heaven's reflex, Killarney !<p>JAMES KAY, GLASGOW.<p>PRICE&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ONE&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; PENNY.<p>27</p>
