	<p> THE  LAST<p>SPEECH and Dying Words<p>OF<p>James Shepherd  who was Exceuted for<br>high Treason.<p>S I R,<p>I Had not Room in my last to reply to your chief Arguments in Defence of your murdering Pupil,<br>Viz. That a Publick National Price has been twice set on the Head of the Pretender, whom<br>you call your Lawful Soveraign, this is another glaring instance of your want of&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sense; be-<br>cause the Argument makes against you, even tho' it could be prov'd, which is simply impossible,<br>that the Pretender is your Lawful King ; for you ought to remember, that you said  the Pretender<br>had expesly forbiden and Disclaimed all such attempts in his Declaration upon his going to Scotland;<br>which is a fair Confession that you and your Pupil wanted the Authority of your  supossed King, nor<br>can you so much as pretend to the Authority even of a mock Parliament, which really alters the Case,<br>for hear by your own Confession the National Authority has twice condemned your Pretender to be<br>dealt with as a Trayter, and an nnjust invader,  We know that the first price was set upon his Head<br>by the late Queen ANN, whose Memory you pretended to revere while you thought  it could be of<br>use to animate your High Church Mob against the present Government, ( but now thanks be to GOD )<br>your Villanious Principles and Designs to Murder even her, are fairly discovered by the Dexterity of<br>Mr.  Lerrain, who put that pertinent Question to your Pupil&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;in the hearing of all that were present<br>whither he would have Killed the Queen had he in her Lifetime the power. and the same  perswasion't<br>To which he answered very readily and impudently that he would; But yon had taught him the Jesu-<br>iitcal Art of Quibling & Desembling so perfectly , that when he perceived the People about him suprized<br>at that Villanious Expression, he endeavoured to recan it, and said. perhaps he would not have done it<br>because she was a Woman who Governed not her self but others did it for her. And that this Assassinating<br>Principlesis entertained by your Party, was also happily difcovered by Mr.  Lorraign, who putting the<br>Question to Shephert's Consessor, whither he did not think in his Conscience that shephert ought pub-<br>lickly to Consess this horrid Crime and beg Pardon for it.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; His Confessor answered No, and at the<br>same time said, that he found Shepherd in a very good State.<p>This Charge was long ago proved upon your Pary, when the None juring Priests Cook and Snat<br>were committed to Newgate for absolving those at the Gallows that were Condemned for a dosign to<br>Assassinate King William of Glorious Memory, without demanding any acknowledgement of their<br>Crimes or prosession or Repentance for it, and Collier who was also one of the Absolvers, would have<br>had the same Fate, had he not fled, This is enough to justify the setting a Prise upon the Head of the<br>Pretender, for whose sake and that of his suposed Father, all these Assassinations were undertaken,<br>there was sufficient Evidence then, that the late French King, and the late King James encouraged<br>these barbarous Designs, and whatever you had said to the contrary, no Body has reason to believe,<br>bat that the Pretender is instructed in the same Principles, since he is an incurable Biggot to the Church<br>Rome, which he has publickly declared that 'tis lawful to Murder Heriticks. France and Ireland<br>as well as other places of Europe have found the Truth of this by woful Experience, and that your<br>Factions entertains the same Villanious maxims, is evident by Sheperds declaring to Mr. Lorraign that<br>he thought it no Crime to Kill King George or any of his Friends, which is Demonstrations of your<br>inclinations, had you power to effect it.<p>We the Grand Jury for Middlesex, do pre ent that Cookand Collier did take upon them to  give Ab<br>solution to Sir John's and Sir William Perkius at Tyburn immediatly before they had severally de-<br>livered a Paper to the Shirriff, wherein they have severally endeavoured to justify  the Treason for<br>which they were justly Condemned and Execute. and that the said Cook and Snat having thereby<br>countenanced the same Treasons for which the said Perkins and Jown's were both Execute to the<br>great cncouragement of other Persons to commit the like Treason, and the scandle of the Church of<br>England established by Law, and to the disturbance of the Peace of the Kingdom, that the World<br>may see what honest Fellows these None-juring Shamm makers were, I think fit to inform you that<br>Cook one of them had been convicted of Forging the Lord Notinghams Hand and Seal to a Pass for<br>One Demsion who was going to France, so that tis no new thing for such as you and your Priests to<br>forge Papers and Speeches as well as Counterfit Passes.<p>EDINBURGH Printed in the Year 1718.</p>
