	<p> TWELVE QUERIES<br>to the<br>CITIZENS of GLASGOW.<p>Query 1.<br>IF the Speaker on the 23d of February, 1784, lives in the<br>neighbouring city, and pays no stent to the town, and no<br>tax to the poor, and does not own the authority of the<br>Provost, nor even the power of a town-officer to seize a de-<br>linquent in the neighboring city, what right had he to speak<br>in that meeting ?<p>Query 2.<br>Being allowed however to speak, did he inform you in<br>a very intelligible manner that you were stupid, contempti-<br>ble, interested, and the smugglers of an address to the K.? <br>If so, What right had he to break through an established<br>rule in speaking; which is, " To set out with courting the<br>" good will of the audience", Unless it was to shew the good-<br>ness of his cause, and the power of his eloquence, by telling<br>you that you were not only stupid and contemptible, but a<br>parcel of s-?<p>Query 3.<br>Stupid and Contemptible as you were represented, did<br>he find that you instantly resented his behaviour, by hissing<br>at him, by rattling with your sticks, and by forming a plan,<br>if he had spoken again, to send him down stairs much fas-<br>ter than he came up ?<p>Quiry 4.<br>Was there any man in that meeting who Could be so<br>Much as supposed to be personally interested in the successs<br>of that address, excepting the speaker himself, to whom the<br>last Ministry attempted to give the office of L. A. and af-<br>terwards that of K. S. ?  Was not this modesty ?<p>Query 5.<br>Did three facts prove that your address was smuggled ?<br>The meeting was called for the avowed purpose of making<br>an address, and not for a different one, like his famous meet-<br>ing which was held in the neighbouring city.  The business<br>of addressing was not communicated to a few, as was the<br>case of the famous address, but to the whole world.  Your<br>address was not carried like the famous one by the minority,<br>but by a prodigious majority of the whole meeting. Was<br>there not good reason then to charge you with stupidity,<br>since you published in the newspapers what you had a mind<br>to conceal, and since there is no making you believe that<br>four is the majority of nine, which is the majority of six-<br>teen, the addressing members in the neighbouring city ?<p>Query 6.<br>Were you not unjust in not allowing another person,<br>Master Cocky Bung, to speak to you against the address ; <br>for he certainly had a perfect right, not only to make a<br>noise, but a noise as a citizen ; because, it is well known,<br>that he made a noise for many years upon old barrels, and<br>in your city ; and because he showed his gratitude for that<br>privilege, and for the bursaries to which he had been pre-<br>sented by the town, by insulting your Provost, when he<br>made a visit in the neighbouring city ; in which hospitable<br>business he was assisted with much humanity by Penna<br>Pennae, Esquire. <p>Query 7.<br>Were you not both unjust and foolish in hindering Mr.<br>Bung to make a speech ; for his arguments, like those of<br>the Speaker, would have served your cause; they being,<br>on all occasions, like the sound of his old trade, without<br>clearness, force, or elegance; while they are overlaid with<br>the dunting of hard words, he being as remarkable in the<br>north for such stuff, as Samuel Johnson is in the south; so<br>that when he wrote a pamphlet like him, it was no imitation,<br>but true nature, having only brought himself down from<br>the superlative to the comparative degree, which made it<br>impossible for the reviewers to tell, which was the counter-<br>feit, and which was the man.<p>Query 8.<br>Was it not unjust in you to allow one of your number,<br>and when standing upon one foot, to ask Mr. Bung, whe-<br>ther the speaker meant by a smuggled address the famous<br>one in the neighbouring city; and to allow another to give<br>Mr. Bung the lie, dividing his words into syllables, that a<br>grammarian, might be at no loss to understand them?&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Will<br>it not be good for Mr. Bung to soap his nose, till he learns<br>something like the manners of a gentleman ?<p>Query 9.<br>Was it foolish in you not to encourage the speaker and<br>Mr. Bung, who, in the course of their reasoning, would<br>have told you many fine things about religion, and repu-<br>blics; and the great good which the Fox will produce by<br>his reformations; such as the taking away of finecures, and<br>at the same time granting pensions; such as the giving<br>100,000 l. instead of 50,000 l. to the P. W. such as the<br>taking away of charters without an equivalent, destroying<br>a mercantile company by an act of power, and destroying<br>the mode of trying individuals as established by King,<br>Lords, and Commons ; so that there will be no longer any<br>trials with open doors, with aid of council, and extracts,<br>which glorious system of republican liberty they actually<br>brought into practice about nine months ago, till they were stopt<br>by the Judges of the King? You will remember too how<br>they acted in expelling a student for a supposed incivility to<br>One of themselves, for no proof could be brought of what<br>was in private, even by their own tale. You may judge of<br>the Fox and his party from his underlings in this country.<br>And will it not be delightful to get a rival commercial<br>company destroyed by applying to him and his faction;<br>and to get any person tried to whom you have a dislike,<br>with shut doors, without counsel, without extracts, and<br>without the check of the King's judges, who are guided<br>by no ideas of republican liberty, but only by law, and<br>by justice?<p>Query 10.<br>Have you not been imposed upon by the merit which<br>the Fox takes to himself from his India bill ? There are only<br>three things in it that deserve your attention. The sove-<br>reignty, the commerce, and the patronage. As to the<br> first you will observe, that it is not the sovereignty of a king,<br>  but of a republic ; and of a republic which has far excelled<br> even Nero in every art that can fix disgrace on human na-<br>ture.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All are now agreed, that the sovereignty of this re-<br>public should be destroyed, because it is an usurpation, and<br>the most oppressive of all governments. Nor is this wonder-<br>full, for it is well known to the historian, that the greatest<br>of all tyrannies have been exercised in republics, both an-<br>cient and modern.  The only question then is about the<br>best method of destroying the sovereignty of this tyrannical<br>usurpation, so as to do justice to the poor Indians.  The<br>Fox therefore and his trumpeter have no merit on this<br>head, because it is the cry of every man, woman, and child.<br>But consider the other two branches of his bill, and there<br>you will see political prostigacy in the highest perfection,<br>First, he attempted to break a chartered right, without so<br>much as pretending to give an equivalent ; so that by the<br>same rule he may seize every charter in the kingdom, upon<br>finding that the persons to whom it is given, have exceeded<br>their power, which he and his friends will always find with<br>the greatest expedition. Secondly, he declared a company<br>of merchants bankrupt, and seized their property, not by<br>the operations of a court of law, which every merchant,<br>and every British subject is entitled to, but by the long<br>arm of legislative power. And, thirdly, he vested the ma-<br>nagement of this mercantile company, not in the proprie-<br>tors, nor in persons named by the Crown, as the executive<br>part of our constitution, in which case it would have been<br>under three checks, that of the King, Lords, and Commons ;<br>but in the uncontroulable junto of the majority of the House<br>of Commons, so that the Earl of ----- in England,<br>and</p>
