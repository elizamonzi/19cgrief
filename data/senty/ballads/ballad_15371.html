	<p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Fatal Duel!<p> An Account of that Fatal Duel that took<br>place, between GEORGE MORGAN, Esq.<br>Banker, and DAVID LANDALE, Esq. Tan-<br>ner, both of Kirkcaldy, in Cardon Den,<br>on the estate of Raith; above Kirk-<br>caldy, on the 23d August, 1826, when<br>George Morgan, Esq. was unfortunate-<br>ly Shot through the Heart on the first<br>fire, and instantly expired.<p>THE following account of this melancholy<br> circumstance, we copy from the Fife Herald<br>of Thursday last, which has just come to our pos-<br>session. We have heard that the cause of the fatal<br>meeting originated in some cash, or rather bill-<br>discounting transactions : but whatever may have<br>been the cause, the result is melancholy indeed,....<br>dreadful even to think of it. We have also heard<br>it reported, as a curious coincidence, that the unfor-<br>tunate gentleman, Mr Morgan, received his death-<br>wound from the very same pistol that killed his<br>father, who, it is said, met with his death in a. si-<br>milar manner, namely, in a duel with the father of<br>Mr Landale.<p>" KIRKALDY.?It is with no ordinary feelings<br>of regret that we have this day to record the fatal<br>issue of one of those unfortunate manoeuvres<br>which the world calls an affair of honour.<p>It seems that an Unpleasant correspondence had<br>taken place between GEORGE MORGAN, Esq.<br>banker here, and DAVID LANDALE, Esq. tanner,<br>arising out of some mercantile or banking tran-<br>saction, which led, as we are informed, to a chal-<br>lenge being given by the latter gentleman on Tues-<br>day last. The parties met yesterday morning at<br>six o'clock, in Cardon Den, on the estate of Raith,<br>accompanied by their seconds, and two medical<br>gentlemen. Having taken their ground at the<br>usual distance, we are sorry to say that Mr Morgan<br>fell, at the first fire ; his antagonist's ball having<br>penetrated his breast, he instantly expired. His<br>body was brought to his own house about seven<br>o'clock ; and precognitions were taken during the<br>day. We hear that Mr Landale and his second<br>have left Kirkaldy."...Fife Herald of Thursday.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ______<p>FIRE.?On Sunday morning, between one and<br>two o'clock, a fire broke out in the ground flat of a<br>tenement, near the west end of Home Street, Toll-<br>Cross, possessed by a confectioner. The fire raged<br>for some time with much fury, but on the arrival<br>of the engines and firemen under Mr Braidwood,<br>the Superintendent, it was got under, not, however,<br>before it had destroyed the flat in which it began,<br>and materially damaged the flat above. An unfor-<br>tunate accident happened to a poor woman, Mrs<br>Easton, who resided in the lower part of the house.<br>In endeavouring to save some part of her furniture,<br>she remained in a room until the smoke became so<br>dense as to prevent respiration, and when she was<br>discovered by one of the firemen, life was extinct.<p>Printed for John Gullagher, Price One Penny.</p>
