	<p> Execution at Inverness.<p>An account of the Execution of Robert Ferguson, at Inerness, on<br>Friday the 13th of November, 1812 for the Murder of Captain Munro,<br>late of the 42d regiment of foot-?with an account of his Behaviour,<br>last Speech and dying Declaration, at the place of execution.<p>ON Friday the 13 th of November, 1812,<br>Robert Ferguson was executed at In-<br>Verness, in pursuance&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of his sentence, for<br>the  Murder of Captain C. Munro, late of<br>the 42d regiment of foot.<p>So uncommon a spectacle in that part of<br>the country, attracted a great concourse of<br>spectatprs, who appeared deeply affected at<br>the melancholy occasion.<p>About one o'clock, the unfortunate man<br>was taken from the prison, and led to the<br>place of execution, attended by the Rev.<br>T. Fraser, and the Rev. D. Martin.<p>On arriving at the place of execution, af-<br>ter prayer and praise, in which the prisoner<br>appeared to join most fervently, he addressed<br>the surrounding multitude in the Gaelic<br>language for a considerable time.<p>He acknowledged himself worthy of death<br>for the crime he had committed deplored<br>the sinfulness of his conduct previous to the<br>unfortunate event which rendered him li-<br>liable to punishment, lamented the ignor-<br>ance in which he was educated, and his ne-<br>glect of moral and religious duties.<p>He particularly regretted his disregard of<br>the Sabbath, and his intemperance, which<br>he said, was the immediate cause of the<br>murder of Captain Munro.<p>He then stated,that, since he came to<br>Inverness, he heard his enemies had report-<br>ed, and industriously circulated, that he<br>was guilty of another murder, and that his<br>wife was accessary to the murder of Captain<br>Munro?both these charges he solemnly<br>repelled.<p>He then made many suitable reflections on<br>his situation, and stated, that, till some time<p>after he was confined in Invernesss prison,<br>he had not access to the Scriptures; that by<br>the benevolenee of well disposed persons in<br>Inverness, he was soon taught to read; and<br>that, ever since, the word of God had been<br>his only comfort. Ignominious as his death <br>appeared, he would, from the consolation<br>he had experienced, meet it without dread.<p>He believed that his condemnation was,<br>in the hands of Providence, the occasion of<br>his conversion, and he said he had full as-<br>surance of the forgiveness of sin, through<br>the merits of Jesus Christ.<p>After his exortation he mounted the drop<br>without the least intimidation, and, after<br>delivering a most impressive prayer, he was<br>launched into eternity without a struggle.<p>Throughout the whole of this awful scene<br>the unfortunate man displayed the most he-<br>roic firmness and Christian resignation, and<br>spoke with a clearness and consistency that<br>astonished all who heard him.<p>The body, having hung the usual time,<br>was carried back to the prison, and given<br>over for dissection, in terms of his sentence.<p>The crime for which this unfortunate<br>man suffered was committed on the 2d of<br>June last, in the smithy of George Thomson.<br>Robert Ferguson used some unbecoming<br>language to Captain Munro, who pushed<br>him out of the shop. Ferguson got into<br>a violent passion, and soon returned, armed<br>with a large knife, with which he run at<br>the Captain, who had only a switch in his<br>hand to defend himself. Ferguson, how-<br>ever, soon closed with him, and gave the<br>Captain a mortal wound in the left side of<br>the cavity of the belly, which occasioned his<br>death the day following.<p>Printed by Thomas Duncan, 159, Saltmarket.</p>
