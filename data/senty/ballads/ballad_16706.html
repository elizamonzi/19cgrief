	<h2>Transcription</h2>
	<p> An Account of the last Dying Words and Execution of<br>MRS. SHUTTLEWORTH, for the Murder of her<br>Husband, on Friday the 7th of December inst. 1821,<br>at Montross, near Edinburgh.<p>THIS day was fixed for the execution of the unfortunate Margaret Tindale, convict-<br> ed of the murder of her Husband, Henry Shuttleworth. The appalling apparatus<br>of death was erected yesterday in front of the gaol?a spectacle never before witnessed in<br>this place. About the beginning of last week a petition was transmitted to his Majesty,<br>signed by a number of respectable Gentlemen of the town, praying for a commutation of<br>punishment, that the feelings of the inhabitants might be spared the horrible exhibition of<br>a public execution?and that too of a female. An answer was last night received from the<br>Secretary of State, stating that the case of the prisoner had already received the most mi-<br>nute investigation of the Privy Council, and that the Petition contained no grounds upon<br>which his Majesty's advisers could feel themselves warranted to recommend the interposi-<br>tion of Royal clemency.<p>Provost Gibson, accompanied by the Rev Dr. Paterson, communicated the result of<br>the Petition to the unfortunate woman. She heard the tidings which extinguished the last<br>ray of hope with great composure, and stated that it was nothing but what she expected.<br>On being visited by her sister the night before her execution, she spoke without any agi-<br>tation concerning her unhappy situation and the dissection of her body, and reproved her<br>sister for giving vent to the excess of her feelings. Dr. Patterson remained with her till<br>about one o'clock of the rooming, assisting her in acts of devotion. After he left her she<br>retired to bed, slept about two hoars, and was up and dressed by six o'clock.<p>In the forenoon she was visited by the Rev. Mr. Dodgson, of the English chapel, who<br>administered the sacrament to her. The constables were summoned to attend in the Town<br>Hall, at twelve o'clock, from which they proceeded about one o'clock, to the front of the<br>prison. About a quarter past two the criminal was brought out, attended by the Rev,<br>Mr, Molleson, Dr. Patterson, and Dr. Dodgson. A part of the 51st Psalm was sung, be-<br>ginning at the seventh verse, in which a part at the audience joined.<p>The Rev. Dr. Paterson then delivered a most fervent and impressive prayer, during<br>which the unfortunate woman kneeled down, and joined with the greatest fervour. At<br>this time the scene was awful and appalling deyond description. The crimiaal was neatly<br>dressed in black:, with a White apron, and altogether appeared in a clean and handsome<br>manner. She now came forward with a firm pace ; and after the executioner had adjust-<br>ed the rope, she addressed the audience in a strong and audible voice?protesting her in-<br>nocence of the crime for which she was to suffer, and cautioned the spectators against the<br>vice of drunkenness, and tha sin of Sabbath-breaking. Her last words were-?"I die in-<br>nocent?I loved my husband?I love my life?Jesus Christ have mercy on my soul."<p>About ten minutes before three the drop fell, and she closed her eyes on sublunary ob-<br>jects without any visible struggle.?After hanging about fifty minutes, the body was tak.<br>en down, and put into a box, to be sent to Edingburgh for dissection, pursuant to her<br>sentence.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (MONTROSS REVIEW, December 7, 1821</p>
