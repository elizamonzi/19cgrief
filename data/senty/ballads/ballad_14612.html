	<p> LETTER.<p><p>A Copy of a Letter regarding that  unfortunate<br>man, John M'Court, who is to be executed on<br> Monday week, for the murder of his wife. Janet<br>M'Lauchlane or M'Court; together with a mel-<br>ancholy Lamentation on the occasion, in which,<br>you have a serious warning to both husbands and<br>wives, to beware of Drunkenness and inordinate<br>passions.<p>The following is an article taken from an Edinbro' news.<br>paper of  Thursday  which shews the falsity of the  current<br>report, that that ill fated man, John M'Court, declines taking<br>any food, and that on the contrary he appears to be truly<br>penitent and resigned to his deplorable fate.<p>We also Subjoin a short lamentation, shewing the state of<br>his mind, and containing a salutary advice to his fellow crea.<br>tures, warning them to Bridle their passions and abstain from<br>bad company and vicious habits, which too often,alas, leads<br>to an ignominious end.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.<p>A report has been generally circulated that M'Court, who<br>is at present a prisoner in the Calton Jail, and who. has  to<br>undergo the extreme penalty of the law for the murder of<br>his wife, Janet M'Lauchlane of M'Court, has put on a resolu<br>tion that he will starve himself to death, in order to avoid the<br>ignomy of a public execution. This assertion, we are informed,<br>through a channel where the utmost confidence may be re-<br>lied on, is altogether unfounded.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We are informed that in.<br>stead of attempting self destruction, he listens to his Rev.<br>attendants with  the greatest earnestness.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  Therefore, was<br>suicide attempted,  the clergymen would doubtless diswade&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>him from such an attempt.<p>It is lamentable in the extreme to reflect on the depravity<br>of this ill fated family. Three of M'Court's sons were<br>banished before they had obtained the age of twelve years,<br>the mother murdered by her own husband, and the husband<br>to. be executed for the murder of  his wife. It appears that<br>M'Court and his wife had long lived very unhappilly together,<br>principally owing to her addiction to drink.<p>While her sons were children, she used to send.them to<br>the streets to beg in order to raise money to satiate her un-<br>hallowed cravings. If these ill fated boys proved unsuccess-<br>ful, she beat them most unmercifully ; they were therefore<br>obliged to steal in order to avoid a drubbing. Thus were<br>the sons of M'Court trained up to vice of every kind and at<br>last becoming by habit and repute thieves, they were found<br>by the laws of their country unfit subjects for home, and were<br>banished to a foreign land.<p>M'Court's wife, by every informatian we have been able  <br>to learn, was an habitual drunkard, and was often found ly.<br>ing in her stair, and at other times carried home,  when her<br>husband would do every thing&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;in his&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;power for her com,<br>fort.<p>LAMENTATION.<p>Come gentle readers listen all<br>To what I here narate ;<br>Take warning of my awful fall<br>Before it is too late.<p>With acking pangs within my<br>breast,<br>I tamely must submit;<br>O may my latter end be blest,<br>Although to die unfit.<p>Had she who suffered by my<br>hands<br>Lived sober, good, and mild,<br>I  never would have broke the<br>bands,<br>Nor satan me beguiled<p>I ever used my utmost power<br>In happiness to live,<br>And even to my latest hour,<br>Her faults I will forgive.<p>Husbands be cautious how you<br>use<br>|The partners of your love,<br>Beware you do not them abuse<br>Or death like mine t'll prove.<p>Wives be  ye  also&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;on  your<br>guard,<br>Your passions do not raise,<br>Of  drinking&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to excess&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;be<br>spared,<br>Also your maker praise.<p>.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - Forbes and Co,Printers,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
