To<br>which the pannel pled not guilty.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  <p>The circumstances of the case were shortly these:<br>The prisoner, along with several others, happened<br>to be in the watch-house, on Tuesday evening, the<br>4th December, and went to take a turn round the<br>church-yard at Libberton, on the night libelled on,<br>from which a body had been attempted to be raised<br>the week before ,and some of his companions<br>thinking he had been rather long out, two of them<br>proceeded to look for him but,the one going be-<br>fore the other, they accidentally took opposite di-<br>rections. The night was cloudy, and windy,with<br>some lightning, and as Ewart was turning a cornor<br>at the church, the deceased Pennycuik approached<br>him. Ewart, believing the deceased to be a resur-<br>rectinest, called out to him three different times,<br>and, receiving no answer, fired at him; but, just<br>as the shot went off, Pennycook said, " Andrew,<br>you'll no shoot me, and fell.<p>There WAS no malice air ill-will, nor any pre-<br>meditated intention of injury, in any sense of the<br>word, alleged against the pannel, but the Solicitor-<br>General mantained, that it was illegal to use fire-<br>arms in watching a church-yard, consequently to<br>shoot a man, on the supposition he was a resurret-<br>rionest, was murder. This view of the law was<br>supported by the unanimous opinion of the court.<br>The Jury, therefore, by a large majority, found the<br>pannel guilty of murder, but unanimously recom-<br>mended him to mercy.<p>The preciding Judge, Lord Gillies, after a so-<br>lemn address, sentenced Ewart to Executed at<br>Edinburgh, on Wednesday the 19th March next,<br>at the usual place of execution, and his body to be<br>delivered for dissection.<p>The prisoner is a decent looking man, and ap-.<br>peared to be very much affected when the awful<br>sentence of death was pronounced against him.<p>WATCHING CHURCHYARDS?The melancholy acci-<br>dent which lately occurred in Libberton Church yard, when<br>a man was mortally wounded by one of the watchmen, who<br>took him for a resurrectionist will not, we trust, be allow  <p>ed. to pass without a strict scrutiny into all the circumsatan-<p>ces connected with it. Much as we detest the practice of<br>raising dead bodies, and anxious as we are that proper<br>measures were adopted for putting an end to this gross and<br>constantly reiterated outrage against the best feeling, of our<br>nature, we cannot imagine a greater evil to flow from it than<br>that the people should take the law into their own hands, <p>and proceed without ceremony to would, maim, or kill<p>persons found trespassing at night within the en-<br>en-closures of a church-yard. This we strongly  urged in<br>a late article on the violation of sepulchres, pre-<br>dicting that if, unchecked, it would soon lead to a state<br>of things repugnant to the very first principles upon which<br>society is founded. At the same time, it is evidently illegal<br>to put loaded fire-arms into the hands of persons employed<br>to watch church-yards, and thereby expose not merely re-<br>surrectionists, but innocent and unoffending individuals to<br>be shot, when the clown who is thus armed, causes to fancy<br>himself warranted in tiring. The practice we know has<br>been winked at with a view of deterring resurrection-<p>ists from  prosecuting their nefarious trade; but the <p>remedy is worse than the evil it was meant to prevent;  <p>and it is high time that a decisive check were given to<br>it. Suppose a resurrectionist is caught  in the fact, we<br>know of no law or principle which will warrant his be-<br>ing shot dead or grievously wounded on the spot : and<br>we have a striking instance before us of the mischief<br>and danger that may ensue from entrusting fire-arms to<br>persons whom fear, folly, or drunkenness may preci-<br>pitate into the commission of acts lit le short of murder__<p>When the accident occurred at Libberton ail the parties<br>were, we understand, in a state of intoxication ; and the<br>unhappy man who met his death was frisking about among<br>the grave-stones, for the purpose of frightening the watch-<br>men. But this, so far from extenuating, aggravates the<br>criminality of the act by which that individual met his<br>death ; and justice will not be done If the person who fired<br>be not called before a jury of his country to answer to a<br>charge of culpable homicide.</p>
