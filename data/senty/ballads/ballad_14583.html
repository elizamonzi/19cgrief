	<p> Trial and<p>Sentence.<p>The Trial Sentence of<br>William Adams, alias Reid,<br>for the Robbery of Michael<br>Pirnie, who is to be executed<br>at Edinburgh on the 6th of<br>January, 1830.<p>Edinburgh, Dec. 1. 1829.<p>Came on before the high Court of Justiciary, the trial<br>of William Adams, or Reid, the indictment stated,<br>that the said William Adams, did in the Venal enter-<br>ing  from the north side of the cowgate of Edinburgh,<br>or on or near a stair leading from the said Venal to the<br>back stairs of Edinqurgh, violently wickedly and felo-<br>niously attack and assault Michael Pirnie, mason,then<br>or residing at Gifford park, near Edinburgh, in the<br>parish of St chuthbert's and county of Edinburgh, and<br>did strike him a severe blow on the head with your<br>clenched fist, or with some; other weapon to the Pro-<br>secutor unknown, by which he was instantly knocked,<br>to the ground ; and while lying on the ground, did by<br>force and violence seize and did rob him of a one pound<br>bank or benker's note of the firm of Sir William.<br>Forbes & co. for shillings and sixpence sterling-<br>or thereby in silver money, and twopence or thereby<br>in copper money, and a plain tin snuff-box being all<br>the property in the possession of the said Michalel<br>Pirnie. The panel dleaded not guilty.<p>Michael Pirnie mason being sworn stated that on<br>the 5th September he was going np the Venel, when<br>the prisoner who had followed him struck him a tre-<br>mendous blow which brought him to the ground. He<br>had in his pockets a twenty shilling note, of the bank<br>of sir William Forbes J. Hunter and C0. four shillings<br>aud sixpence in silver, and twopence in copper money,<br>also a plain tin snufF-box ; after being foundered with<br>the blow and knocked down the prisoner kicked and<br>struck him very severely He identified the tin snuff-<br>box which was shown im.<p>A number of witnesses were examined whose<br>various statements went to prove the charge against<br>the prisoner, and completely established the fact of his<br>identity.<p>The Lord Justice Clerk pointed out the evidence to<br>the Jury at full length, and particularly bore upon the<br>'evidences  of the various&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;witnesses whose  evidence<br>brought home the charge to the prisoner,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Jury<br>after consulting for  some time gave  in their  unani-<br>mous verdict of guilty.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Lord Justice Clerk  then<br>addressed the prisoner in a  very  feeling  speech&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and<br>said that although the Jury had humanely recommen-<br>ded him, yet he warned him not to place any hopes on<br>that recommendation, but to&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;prepare himself for the<br>awful end, which the  laws  of his  country  submitted<br>to.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He then pronounced  the sentence,  which  was<br>that he was to be executed at Edinburgh on the 6th of<br>January, 1830, betwixt the  hours  of eignt and  nine<br>o'clock morning, at the usual place of execution.<p>The prisoner is a.tall stout looking young man, and<br>is well known in Edinburgh,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;more  especially&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;at the<br>head of the canongate, being brought up by his grand-<br>mother who keeps a small shop at that place, and&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;in<br>fact was better known by her name (Reid) than by his<br>own.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; His father is a porter  in Edinburgh, an honest<br>and quiet man, but we are sorry to say that the prison-<br>er has proved himself all along a very undutiful and<br>disobedient son, he is now about 20 years of age, which<br>he has spent in a very loose and dissolute manner.<p></p>
