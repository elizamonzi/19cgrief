	<p> Coronation of His Majesty<p>Which took place at London on Thursday last, the 19th July, 1821,<br>with an account of the non-admittance of the Queen.<p><br>London, July 19th,1822.?This morning, so early as two o'clock, the streets resounded<br>With the rattling of carriages, and at three the platform leading from Westminister Hall to<br>the Abbey was thrown open to public view.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The outside of the platform was occupied<br>by masses of troops, and disclosed the interior, like the celebrated Trojan horse,  filled with<br>Soldiers, lying down, except a few to prevent the intrusion of the populace.<p>About half-past five o'clock, her Majesty in her state carriage, drawn by 6 horses, en-<br>tered St. James' Park by Constitution Hall Gate. Her Majesty was not observed  until she<br>entered the Park, when she was loudly cheered, and the general exclamation was, " God-<br>bless your Majesty! stick up for your rights, we will protect you !". The soldiers at the<br>different posts  which She passed, presented  arms to her. Her Majesty was dressed in white,<br>and had on her head a eap or bandeau, with a large plume of white ostrich feathers, and<br>appeared  in full health. About half-past six o'clock, the Lord  Mayor and other Members<br>of the City, proceeded for Westminster Hall. Her Royal Highness the Duchess of Glou-<br>cester was the first of the Royal Family who arrived. About half-past, shouts were  heard<br>from without, and a great bustle among the guards around the entrance, and cries of  "Shut<br>the gates! shut the gates, were distinctly heard, and as readily obeyed." This announced<br>the approach of her Majesty, and the military formed in double line across the platform,<br>to prevent the entry of her Majesty. Her Majesty then drove round to the west front of<br>the Abbey, and the carriage drew up, when Lord Hood alighted to search for some ingress<br>to the Hall. Having found a gate in the rear of the Champion's stable, he returned, and<br>her Majesty, with her attendants, alighted.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <p> On reaching the gate the royal party were informed that this was no thoroughfare ; they<br>then proceeded to another passage which was open for persons with Peer's tickets. Here<br>an officer of the guard presented  himself, and half-drawing his sword,asked their authority<br>to pass, when Lord Hood presented a ticket, and they were allowed to pass the platform.<br>They then proceeded to the House of Lords, to try to enter the Hall; but were debarred<br>all ingress. They tried the passage leading into the Abbey from Poet's corner, and were<br>informed that none but persons with a regular ticket could be admitted. Lord Hood asked<br>whether they were aware that it was the Queen who sought admittance ? and her Majesty<br>twice repeated, " I am your Queen! I am your Queen !" The persons repeated their orders<br>were peremptory. Her Majesty then returned with her attendants  to her  carriage and they<br>drove off, amidst enthnusiastic cheers. The reception which her Majesty met with from<br>people of all ranks was most flattering, and shows the high estimation in which she is held.<br>  His Majesty entered the Hall about ten o'clock, accompanied by the Great Officers of<br>State, the Band playing God save the King. A gun was then fired, announcing his Majesty<br>having taken his seat. The regalia having been brought by the Lord Chancellor, the De-<br>puty Lord Chamberlain took up the several swords, sceptres, the orb, and crown, placing<br>them in the hands of those who were to carry them. Here follows the names of the differ-<br>ent articles and their bearers, with a long list of Dukes, Marquisses, Lords and Bishops,<br>who attended this earthly procession, which would only wear out the patience of any ra-<br>tional man to peruse.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>  The whole having arrived, the Archbishop stood at the altar, having St. Edward's crown<br>before him, took the same into his hands, and consecrated and blessed it with the prayer,<br>" O God, who crownest thy faithful servants with mercy,"' &c. The Archbishop then took<br>the crown and placed it on the head of his Majesty, while the people, with loud and repeat-<br>ed shouts, cried " God save the King !" the trumpets sounding, the drums beating, and<br>the Tower and Park guns firing by signal. The acclamation ceasing, the Bishop pronounc-<br>ed the exhortation, " Be strong and of a good courage," &c. The choirs then sung the<br>following anthem, " The King shall rejoice in thy strength," &c. As soon as the  King<br>was crowned, the Peers put on their coronets the Bishops their caps, and the Kings of<br>Arms their crowns.<br>The eastern parts of London were quite deserted, and a stream of people was pouring to-<br>wards Westminster and the Parks. It was delightful to witness the peace and joy which<br>beamed on all around. Mr Sadler and a friend  ascended in a magnificent balloon from the<br>Green Park, It ascended perpendicnlarly, with the rapidity of a rocket, and had a grand<br>effect. All things went off quietly, and there were but few accidents, considering the vast<br>number of spectators assembled.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  <p>W. Carse, Printer, Glasgow.</p>
