	<p> Alas!  Jamie's Pickled<p>ELEGIAC LINES<p>ON THE<p>Tragical Murder<p>OF<p>POOR DAFT JAMIE.<p>Gude people all, I pray give ear, to what I now do say,<br>And buy a copy o' this Poem before I gang away;<br>It can't but melt the hardest heart, whoe'er d' read it o'er,<br>How poor daft Jamie met his death, the like was ne'er before.<p>ATTENDANCE give, whilst I relate<br>How poor Daft Jamie met his fate;<br>'Twill make your hair stand on your head,<br>As I unfold the horrid deed :--<p>That hellish monster, William Burke,<br>Like Reynard sneaking on the lurk,<br>Coyduck'd his prey into his den,<br>And then the woeful work began :--<p>" Come, Jamie, drink a glass wi' me,<br>And I'll gang wi' ye in a wee,<br>To seek yer mither i' the town-<br>Come drink, man, drink, an' sit ye down."<p>" Nae, I'll no' drink wi' ye the nou,<br>For if I div 'twill mak' me fou;"<br>" Tush, man, a wee will do ye guid,<br>'Twill cheer yer heart, an' warm yer bluid."<p>At last he took the fatal glass,<br>Not dreaming what would come to pass ;<br>When once he drank, he wanted more--<br>Till drunk he fell upon the floor.<p>" Now," said th' assassin, "now we may<br>Seize on him as our lawful prey."<br>" Wait, wait," said Hare, " ye stupid ass,<br>He's yet too strong--let's tak' a glass."<p>Like some unguarded gem he lies--<br>The vulture waits to seize its prize;<br>Nor does he dream he's in its power,<br>Till it has seized him to devour.<p>The ruffian dogs,--the hellish pair,--<br>The villain Burke,--the meagre Hare,--<br>Impatient were the prize to win,<br>So to their smothering pranks begin :--<p>Burke cast himself on Jamie's face,<br>And clasp'd him in his foul embrace;<br>But Jamie waking in surprise,<br>Writhed in an agony to rise.<p>At last, with nerves unstrung before,<br>He threw the villain on the floor ;<br>And though alarm'd, and weaken'd too,<br>He would have soon o'ercome the foe :<p>But help was near--for it Burke cried,<br>And soon his friend was at his side;<br>Hare tripp'd up Jamie's heels, and o'er<br>He fell, alas! to rise no more !<p>Now both these blood-hounds him engage,<br>As hungry tygers fill'd with rage,<br>Nor did they handle axe or knife,<br>To take away Daft Jamie's life.<p>No sooner done, than in a chest<br>They cramm'd this lately welcom'd guest,<br>And bore him into Surgeons' Square--<br>A subject fresh--a victim rare !<p>And soon he's on the table laid,<br>Expos'd to the dissecting blade;<br>But where his members now may lay<br>Is not for me--or you--to say.<p>But this I'll say--some thoughts did rise :<br>It fill'd the Students with surprise,<br>That so short time should intervene<br>Since Jamie on the streets was seen.<p>But though his body is destroy'd,<br>His soul can never be decoy'd<br>From that celestial state of rest,<br>Where he, I trust, is with the bless'd.<p>Written by J. P.<p>Second Edition.<p>N. B.--There is published by the same Editor, (the second Edition with alterations,)<br>a LACONIC NARRATIVE of the LIFE and DEATH of POOR JAMIE ; in which are inter-<br>spersed, several Anecdotes relative to him, and his old friend BOBY AWL :--PRICE THRIP<br>PENCE.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The work will be embellished with a striking Portrait of Jamie.<br>Published by W.
