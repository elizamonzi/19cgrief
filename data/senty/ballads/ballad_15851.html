	<p> THE Feeing Time<p>My friend and I struck frae Milngavie,<br>For Glasgow town we took our way;<br>When all along the road was strung<br>With lads and bonnie lassies gay.<br>When drawing nigh one did I spy,<br>She was walking slowly by hersel',<br>For fear the rain her claes would spoil,<br>I did display my umbrell.<p>Where are ye gaun, my bonnie lass,<br>How far, then, are you bound this way?<br>To Glasgow town, sir, I am bound,<br>For this you know is feeing day.<br>Says he, the day seems wet to be,<br>Although the morning did look fine;<br>Smiling, she said, I am afraid<br>I'll no be in again feeing time.<p>O, cheer your heart my bonnie lass,<br>We'll hae good weather by and bye,<br>And don't be sad when with a lad,<br>A roving baker frae Milngavie.<br>And if you will accept a gill,<br>Of whisky, brandy, rum, or wine,<br>Well hae a gill, and then we will<br>Be in Glasgow by the feeing time.<p>She gave consent, and in we went<br>To an ale-house that was by the way;<br>Glass after glass, round it did pass,<br>Till we baith forgot it was feeing day.<br>The clock struck three, she smiled on me,<br>Says she, young lad, the fault is thine,<br>For night is on and I'm from home,<br>And besides I've lost my feeing day.<p>Its lass don't grieve, for while I live,<br>I ne'er intend for to harm you;<br>For marriage I will surely try,<br>And baker lads they aye prove true.<br>I'm too young to wed a man,<br>Besides my mother has nane but me,<br>But I'll comply and ne'er deny,<br>And I'll wed before I take a fee.<p>We spent that night in merriment,<br>So we got married the next day.<br>And aye since syne my love does say,<br>I'm glad I lost my feeing day.<br>My love and I we do agree,<br>I neer do think she will repine,<br>For every day she smiles and says,<br>I'm glad I lost my feeing time.<p>W. M'Namara's Lament FOR JOHN MITCHELL.<p>You Irish heroes of Hibernia's nation,<br>Give ear with patience to what I say,<br>Let young and old of you be clad in mourning,<br>Since brave John Mitchell is in the clay;<br>For he loved the land the tyrant taught to handle,<br>Left many a foe in their crimson gore,<br>He felt the pain of Bermuda's chain,<br>But alas! John Mitchell is now no more.<p>In '48 he thought to complete<br>The work, great and grand, that was so long in hand,<br>Like famed Owen Roe, for to strike a blow,<br>And to drown each foe in the River Ban.<br>Because English peers they would not adhere<br>To nine millions' tears on the Shamrock Shore,<br>Mitchell said, Draw your freedom blades,<br>But alas! that hero is now no more.<p>If every man had made a stand,<br>And lent a hand to John Mitchell's call,<br>Our flag of green, we so much esteemed,<br>Would now be seen on each rampart wall.<br>But Mitchell, Maher, and O'Brien were taken,<br>And brave Jehn Martin of Rorstrevor shore;<br>They were tried, convicted, condemned, transported,<br>But, alas! John Mitchell is now no more.<p>For English gold then the cause was sold,<br>And our heroes bold had to cross the main,<br>Their crime was love to their Irish nation-<br>They had strove to burst the oppressor's chain.<br>John Mitchell brave would not live a slave,<br>To Bermuda's jail he soon bade adieu;<br>He wrote those words on his prison table:-<br>"The man that stops me, I'll run him through."<p>When he reached New York then he went to Cork,<br>In Bermuda's prison he would no more be seen,<br>He had friends galore, with their guns in store,<br>On Columbia's shore they'd still love the green.<br>To the American, Irish, and Yankee heroes,<br>The brave John Mitchell, he did relate<br>The persecution of the Irish people<br>From 1500 to '98.<p>How Ned and Bess did our church distress,<br>If a priest said mass he would suffer sore,<br>They would flog or mangle, behead or strangle,<br>Like to Father Murphy and thousands more.<br>When Michael Allan, O'Brien, and Larkin,<br>And the valiant Barrett, they suffered sore,<br>John Mitchell called up a Fenian meeting,<br>Of ten thousands heroes on Columbia's shore.<p>When he took the chair and saw what was there,<br>Amid deafening cheering and loud applause,<br>He said he'd risk his life and freedom,<br>For one Fenian charge through their martial laws.<br>But Mitchell's gone where the saints and martyrs,<br>And patriots wear a glorious crown,<br>Where perjured traitors receive their merit-<br>No orange juryman can there be found.<p>This noble friend has come to his end,<br>For the brave John Martin we do deplore,<br>His dying words were: "God Save Ireland,"<br>And alas! John Mitchell is now no more.<br>And Irish patriots will weep for him,<br>While the shamrock grows on Erin's shore,<br>And the harp shall murmur in accents wailing,<br>Our brave John Mitchell is now no more,</p>
