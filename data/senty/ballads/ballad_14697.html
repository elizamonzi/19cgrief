	<p> Another Church Yard Pirate,<p>Who was caught in the High Church Yard<br>on Thursday Morning, the 1st May,<br>with a dead body.<p>Glasgow, May 1st, 1823.?This morning, another of those<br>disgusting scenes occurred, which produces horror in the minds<br>of the living, and keeps them in anxious suspense concerning<br>the bodies of the departed dead.<p>As the watchman was on duty near the High Church, he ob-<br>served a fellow coming over the wall from the burying ground.<br>He instantly sprung his rattle, and with the assistance of some<br>people had him secured. When seized, he had in his posses- <br>sion the body of a man put up in a sack, which, along with<br>the culprit, was taken to the Police Office. The depredator<br>keeps the shop of a medical person in town. The body was<br>claimed this morning by the wife and son of the deceased. The<br>name of the deceased was John Dempster, a labourer, who<br>was hurt some time since at the new building at the foot of<br>Montrose Street. He died in the Royal Infirmary, and was<br>buried on Tuesday afternoon. The poor woman was this morn-<br>ing in a most melancholy condition, on beholding, in such a<br>way, the countenance of her husband. We refrain from en-<br>tering into farther particulars, until an investigation of the af-<br>fair by the proper authorities, be laid before the public.<p>Such outrages as have lately been committed on the mansions<br>of the dead, calls aloud for some exemplary punishment being<br>inflicted on these worst of pirates, who, afraid of meeting with<br>any person who can offer them resistance, practise their thefts<br>in the lonely church-yard. It is surely a most lamentable and<br>afflicting circumstance, that, after a poor family has involved<br>itself in debt, (which often requires the greatest-industry to ex-<br>tricate itself from) in order to get the object whom they loved<br>decently interred, and, as they thought safe from the plundering<br>hands of man, it adds a deeper wound to their feelings, and keeps<br>the community in constant dread of their friends, after their depar-<br>ture, sharing a like fate.<p>We would recomond it to those who pretend that it is for the<br>good of Society that Subjects should be had, in order to treat on,<br>the number in that line, being now very numerous, it would confer a<br>favour, if they would bequeath their own bodies, at their death, for<br>so laudable a purpose.<p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  W.
