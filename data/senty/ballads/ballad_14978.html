turn thee ! beardless youth<br>He loud insulting cries.<p>Soon turned about the fearless chief,<br>And soon his sword he drew,<br>For Donald's blade before his breast<br>Had pierced his tartan through.<p>This for my brother's slighted love,<br>His wrongs sit on my arm ;<br>Three paces back the youth retired,<br>And saved himself from harm.<p>Returning swift, his sword he reared<br>Fierce Donald's head above,<br>And thro' the brain and crashing bones<br>The sharp-edged weapon drove.<p>He staggering reeled, then tumbled down<br>A lump of lifeless clay;<br>So fall my foes ! quoth valiant Rose,<br>And stately strode away.<p>Thro' the green wood in haste he passed<br>Unto Lord Buchan's hall ;<br>Beneath Matilda's window stood,<br>And thus on her did call.<p>Art thou asleep, Matilda, dear,<br>Awake, my love, awake !<br>Behold thy lover waits without,<br>A long farewell to take.<p>For I have slain fierce Donald Graham,<br>His blood is on my sword,<br>And distant are my faithful men,<br>Nor can defend their lord.<p>To Skye I will direct my flight,<br>Where my brave brothers bide,<br>And raise the mighty of  the Isles<br>To combat on my side.<p>Oh, do not so, the maid replied,<br>With me till morning stay,<br>For dark and dreary is the night,<br>And dangerous the way.<p>All night I'll watch thee in the park,<br>My faithful page I'll send<br>In haste to raise the brave clan Rose,<br>Their master to defend.<p>He laid him down beneath a bush,<br>And wrapped him in his plaid : <br>While, trembling for her lover's fate,<br>At a distance stood the maid.<p>Swift ran the page o'er hill and dale,<br>Till, in a lonely glen,<br>He met the furious Sir John Graham,<br>With twenty of his men.<p>Where go'st thou, little page, he said,<br>So late?who did thee send ?<br>I go to raise the brave clan Rose,<br>Their master to defend;<p>For he has slain Sir Donald Graham,<br>His blood is on his sword,<br>And far, far distant are his men,<br>That should assist their lord.<p>And has he slain my brother dear,<br>The furious chief replies;<br>Dishonour blast my name, but he<br>By me ere morning dies.<p>Say, page, where is Sir James the Rose ?<br>I will thee well reward;<br>He sleeps into Lord Buchan's park,<br>Matilda is his guard.<p>They spurr'd their steeds and furious flew<br>Like lightning o'er the lea;<br>They reach'd Lord Buchan's lofty tow'rs<br>By dawning of the day.<p>Matilda stood without the gate,<br>To whom the Graham did say-<br>Saw ye Sir James the Rose last night,<br>Or did he pass this way ?<p>Last day at noon, Matilda said,<br>Sir James the Rose passed by ;<br>He furious pricked his sweaty steed,<br>And onward fast did hie.<p>By this he is at Edinburgh,<br>If horse and man hold good ;<br>Your page then lied, who said he was<br>Now sleeping in the wood.<p>She wrung her hands and tore her hair,<br>Brave Rose, thou are betrayed,<br>And ruined by those means, she cried,<br>From whence I hoped thine aid.<p>And now the valiant knight awoke,<br>The virgin's shrieks he heard ;<br>Straight up he rose and drew his sword<br>When the fierce band appeared.<p>Your sword last night my brother slew,<br>His blood yet dims its shine,<br>But ere the setting of the sun <br>Your blood shall reek on mine.<p>You word it well, the chief replied,<br>But deeds approve the man ;<br>Set by your men, and, hand to hand,<br>We'll try what valour can.<p>Oft boasting hides a coward's heart,<br>My weighty sword you fear,<br>Which shone in front of Flodden Field<br>When you kept in the rear.<p>With dauntless step he forward strode,<br>And dared him to the fight,<br>But Graham gave back and feared his<br>For well he knew its might.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[arm,<p>Four of his men, the bravest four,<br>Sunk down beneath his sword ,<br>Bui still he scorned the poor revenge,<br>And sought their haughty lord.<p>Behind him basely came the Graham,<br>And pierced him in the side;<br>Out spouting came the purple stream,<br>And all his tartans dyed.<p>But yet his hand dropped not  the sword ,<br>Nor sunk he to the ground,<br>Till through his enemy's heart his steel,<br>Had forced a mortal wound.<p>Graham, like a tree by wind  o'erthrown,<br>Fell breathless on the clay,<br>And down beside him sunk the Rose,<br>And faint and dying lay.<p>Matilda saw, and fast she ran,<br>Oh, spare his life, she cried:<br>Lord Buchan's daughter begs his life,<br>Let her not be denied.<p>Her well-known voice the hero heard,<br>He raised his death-closed eyes,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>And fixed them on the weeping maid,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>And, weakly, thus replied :&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <p>In vain Matilda begs the life&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>By Death's arrest denied;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  <br>My race is run?adieu ! my love,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>Then closed his eyes and died.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <p>The sword, yet warm, from his left side,<br>With frantic hand she drew ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>come, Sir James the Rose, she cried, <br>I come to follow you.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  <p>The hilt she leaned against the ground<br>And bared her snowy breast,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>Then fell upon her lover's face,<br>And sunk to endless rest.<p>Saturday morning, January 23, 1869.</p>
