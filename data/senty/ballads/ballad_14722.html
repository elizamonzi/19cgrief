	<h2>Transcription</h2>
	<p> An account of the proceedings at the Lancaster Assizes against the<br>Rioters in Lancashire; when no less than 35 Men and 7 Women<br>received the awful sentence of Death on Monday last, for destroy-<br>ing the Steam-power Looms ; Also, the excellent Address of the<br>Judge on passing Sentence, with the Names of the unfortunate<br>Prisoners.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  <p>LANCASTER, MONDAY, AUGUST 21, 1826.<p>This day the sentence of Death was recorded against no less than 35 men and 7 women,<br>convicted of destroying different Steam Loom Factories &c., in Lancashire.<p>The prisoners having been placed, 42 in the dock, in sets, his Lordship addressed them<br>as follows:------<p>Prisoners?I have desired that you might be hrought up here, a few at a time. I lament <br>most deeply that there are no fewer than 42 follow-creatures under capital conviction for a<br>most heinous offence. It is impossible for a country governed by law, that it should be<br>permitted to persons to endeavour to relieve their own distresses by violence. There has<br>been, God knows, a great pressure of distress in this country, but it cannot be permitted<br>to individuals to carve out their own relief. You are most deluded persons; for you have<br>been destroying the means by which you were to live, and taking out of the hands of those<br>who were disposed to serve you, the means by which they could do so. It is of high im-<br>portance that these things should not be tolerated, and that men guilty of such offences<br>should receive a very severe punishment. The law has affixed to the crime of which you<br>have been guilty, the punishment of Death. It is not my intention, however, to carry that<br>sentence into full effect, and I shall recommend it to his Majesty to be pleased to pardon<br>you so far as your lives are concerned. My motives for so doing are these?that I think it<br>probable that the lenity which is about to be shown to you will have a due effect upon your<br>minds, and that what you have already seen and heard will convince you that the law is able<br>to reach you even to the extent of your lives for these offences, and that it is your own in-<br>terest, happiness and comfort, to lead quiet and respectable lives. The injury which you do<br>to your families by these courses cannot be calculated, because, if parents, brothers, and<br>sons, will commit offences, they must involve in their punishment their innocent relatives.<br>Another motive for my lenity is, that most of those who have been convicted are extremely<br>young persons, and, although their outrages have been dreadful and disgraceful as against<br>property, I have not found any instance, with a single exception, of pessonal violence being<br>resorted to.<p>I have said that most of you are young: I must make an exception to that observation,<br>in one of the prisoners now standing before me, viz. James Chambers, who is the oldest<br>amongst you, and the most grievous offender, because he has been convicted of two capital<br>felonies, in which he took the most active and riotous part, and also of an offence not capi-<br>tal, under another statute. It was my intention at one time, and I may say for several<br>days, to have made him an example by taking his life; but I shall not select him singly on<br>this occasion, and therefore I shall not clect him singly on this occasion, and therefore I<br>shall transmit his name, amongst others, for His Majesty's gracions  consideration. But I<br>would not have you consider that, although I transmit this recommendation, those who ad-<br>vise His Majesty may not think it necessary to carry the sentence into full effect; but I<br>hope, I indeed believe, that this will not be the case. Do not,. however, flatter yourselves<br>too strongly, that you will escape without very severe punishment. Another motive which<br>has induced me to take the course I have taken, is, that the respectable Juries who have<br>tried you, have recommended the first six of you to mercy; and that on a ground which is<br>applicable to all the cases, namely, the severe pressure of the times. I have nothing more<br>to say, but that I earnestly trust that the dredful example of punishment which is now<br>about to be made, and which must be made, though I trust it will not reach the lives of any<br>at you, will convince you that no happiness can result from a life of turbulence and riot, but<br>that peace and good order are always conducive to the interest and happiness of men. <p>The following are the prisoners convicted:?James Riding, Wm. Sutcliffe, Rd. Kay, Jas.<br>Latham, James Ormerod, James Haworth, James Chambers, Simeon Wright, Rd. Entwisle,<br>Wm. Winder, John Haworth, Henry Melling, Thomas Lomax, Thos. Greenhalgh, James<br>Crowshaw, Thos. Leaver, Isaac Hindle, Thos. Dickinson, James Leaver, Edw. Houghton,<br>Thos. Ashworth, Thos. Sharples, Rt. Butterworth, James Aspden, James Shorrock; Alext<br>Norris, John Orrell, Thos. Emett, Mary Hidle, Betty Haworth, Ann Eatwisle, Mary Mars-<br>den, Margaret Yates, Betty Cunliffe, Josh. Clayton, John Hoyle, Mark Cockerill, Jonah<br>Baldwin, Ann Ingham, Lawrence Hardman, Geo. Ashworth, John Ashworth.<p>John Muir, printer, Glasgow.</p>
