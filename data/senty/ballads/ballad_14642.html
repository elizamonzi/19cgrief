	<p>  ROBBERY OF<p><p>Dead Bodies.<p>An account of that woman who died in Jamaica<br>Street, Edinburgh, on the 3d Feb. 1825, and after<br>being coffined and locked up, the room was en-<br>tered by a window, the corpse stolen, and the<br>coffin filled with stones ; also the apprehension of<br>a resurrection man in Haddington church-yard<br>with the instruments employed for lifting the<br>dead. Likewise an account of the discovery of<br>the body of a man in a trunk, by  a porter at<br>Pettycur while carrying it to the steam-boat, on<br>Tuesday the 8th Feb and which had been brought<br>from Dundee on its way to Edinburgh.<p>Those who follow the unlawful employment of stealing dead<br>bodies are now contriving, in place of taking them out of their<br>graves, to get possession of them belore they are buried. Last<br>week, a poor woman, who lived by  herself, died in Jamaica Street,<br>when her body was placed in a coffin and the house shut up. In<br>the course of Thursday night the house was entered by a window<br>from a back lane, the body was carried off, and the coffin filled<br>with stones. The discovery was not made till Friday, when the<br>interment was about to take place.<p>On Friday the 30th ult. about one o'clock, the watchmen, when<br>going their rounds in the church-yard of Haddington, had their<br>attention suddenly arrested by the sound of a whistle; being fully<br>convinced of the sound having proceeded from a person intending<br>to desturb the silent repositories of the dead, they stationed them-<br>selves near to the place where four bodies were lately interred, to<br>wait in silence the approach of the resurrectionist. In a few<br>minutes he leaped over the wall, carrying along with him a bag,<br>a rope, and a screw, (such as is used on similiar occasions), when<br>he was immediately laid hold of by Andrew Kerse, late of the<br>49th regiment, who, with the assistance of his neighbour watch-<br>men, conducted him to the watch-house, in the coal-honse of<br>which he was confined till eight o'clock, when he was carried<br>before Provost Dodds for examination; but he persisted in silence<br>in his presence, as he had hitherto done in the watch-house ;<br>he was therefore committed to jail for farther examination. He<br>appears to be an Irishman, but refuses to give his name or the<br>number of his accomplices.<p>An occurrence happened at Pettycur on Tuesday forenoon,<br>which nearly proved fatal to the person concerned. The Coach<br>arrived from Dundee with passengers and luggage for the Steam<br>Boat at Pettycur for Leith ; the porters employed carrying a<br>trunk from the Coach to to the Boat, thought that a nauseous<br>smell peoceeded from it and immediately threw it down, waiting<br>for their employer, who was well known as a constant weekly<br>passenger for some time past; and when he came forward, the<br>crowd which by this time began to get numerous, demanded to<br>see it opened, which he stiffly refused, untill he saw that violence<br>was going to be applied, when he told them that his master was<br>in the Inn, and he would go and get the key. Judging his in-<br>tention, they watched him, to see if he would enter the Inn,<br>but as soon as he passed the door he took to his heels, and<br>endeauoured to make his escape; he was however overtaken, and<br>was with great difficulty lodged in Kingborn Jail, not without<br>some cuts and bruises from the usage of the crowd ; who, especially<br>the women, manifested a determination to give him summary<br>punishment; the trunk was opened, and the body of a dead man<br>found therein, supposed to be taken from [some of the Church.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>yards in Dundee.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<p>Edinburgh, Printed for J.
