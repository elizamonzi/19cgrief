	<h2>Transcription</h2>
	<p> Execution of Mary M'Kinnon.<p>16th April, 1823: with her own account of her I ife.<p>This morning, at a few minntes before 9 o'clock, the<br>unfortunate woman, Mary M'Kinnon. appeared on the<br>scaffold, at Libberton's Wynd, attired in mournings.<p>Sne had to be supported to the scaffold, where sev-<br>eral ministers met her and endeavoured to compose her<br>mind. She made several attempts to address the im-<br>mense multitude that surrounded her;. and then gave<br>the fatal signal, and was launched into eternity.<p>She was daughter of an officer of the army, residing<br>at Inverness. At the age of about 20 years, she was re-<br>siding in her father's house, at the above-mentioned<br>place. Her mother and two sisters, who are ai present<br>employed at a mill in the Gorbals, were also, then with<br>her father, who was a quarter-master. And, at that<br>period which may be reckoned back to about 20 years<br>ar o, it appears that an Irish officer, of the 7.?-regriment<br>paid his addresses to her. This person being known to<br>her fa her as one of loose morals, she was dissuaded from<br>encouraging his visits; notwithstanding which she con-<br>trived ro elope with him, and afterwards confided herself<br>to his protection. Indeed, her father having by th s<br>time disowned her, such a trust will seem to be more<br>the act of pitiable necessity, than of implicit faish. The<br>advantage which this person took of the confidence of<br>a weak woman, might justify her hatred of the sex during<br>her life. She is about 40 years of age, but no more.<p>The result of her connexion with  officer was, that he, soon<br>after, deserted her, when she was then thrown upon the world With<br>what money she could  collect from the sale of her clothes and other<br>valuables, she was enabled  to open a small public house, in Inver-<br>uess, and in which situation it was that she gave  birth to an infant,<br>the offspring of the guilt of her seducer. There are few tender<br>hearts but will feel for her at this juncture. This occurrence com-<br>ing, to the ears of her father, it appears he was prepared to ex.<br>pect something of that nature, when he Wrote to her making seveva<br>comments on her disgracing her family. At this period she re-<br>irioyed to Edinburgh, with her little BEN ONI; on the charms of<br>whose innocence, her mind always delighted to dwell, with<br>the most enthusiastic affection. This child at the age of 8 years was<br>sent to London, and there still remains. This is from her own mouth.<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mayne & Co.
