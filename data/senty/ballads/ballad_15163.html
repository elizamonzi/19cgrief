	<h2>Transcription</h2>
	<p> An  Account of the Trial and Sentences<br>of Thomas Hay. for stabbing Wil-<br>liam. Moffat, in Leith, on the 18th<br>of July last, and before his sentence<br>is carried into execution he is to be<br>lashed through the town of Leith on<br>Wednesday 18th February 1824.<p>A case came on for trial yesterday, (2d February 1824,) unpara-<br>lleled by the recent atrocity in Hertfordshire, and can only be<br>compared to some of the crimes which the busy tongue of rum-<br>our had alleged against Thurtell and his gang. In the present<br>instance the accused, Thomas Hay, resided in a solitary manner<br>in a house in King street, Leith, no living creature cohabited<br>with him. Having fitted up his inner room as a human slaugh<br>ter-house, he set out one morning in July last in quest of his in-<br>tended victim, whom he deeoyed to the place of sacrifice, and a-<br>gainst whom he aimed the murderous blow,?but happily failed<br>in the accomplishment of his diabolical purpose.<p>The indictment having been read, the panel pleaded, " I am<br>not guilty my Lord, but Mr Wilson is gnilty of rousing me out<br>of my bed this morning, and bringing me here without my break<br>fast, a state, I presume, which no  one present is in besidee myself."<p>Mr William Moffat, wright in Leith, said that on the 18th of<br>July last, he waas walking, and met the prisoner about 8 in the<br>morning, who asked him to go along with him to see some re-<br>pairs he had to make, and requested him to send away  two dogs<br>that followed the witness,  as the pannel had a cat and kittens in<br>the house, when they got in the house the pannel locked and<br>bolted the door prisoner pressed him to go into another room<br>from the one they first eatered, witness did so, and observed to<br>the pannel that his was-cloth on the floor was not properly laid<br>down, for the red side was uppermost, and the ends lying against<br>the the chairs and bed instead of being laid below them.  The<br>pannel invited witness to take a glass of spirits, he then said that<br>he had bought some property in Edinburgh, and, wished witness<br>to put up some partitions, and wished him to go and settle with<br>the person he bought the property from, as his leg was so sore<br>he could not go himself, and asked witness to make out a receipt<br>for what money he would entrust him with, which was £220,<br>and shewed him 12 £20 pound  notes. The pannel gave him a<br>letter to read, while doing so he lift up his eyes and saw the<br>panuel unfolding something, which he thought at the time was<br>the money, but shortly after witness was surprised to hear a<br>strong suction of breath very near him, after seeing the prisoner<br>at a distance from him, he locked up and saw prisoner standing<br>over him and making a thrust with a knife, which in attempting<br>to ward off the blow he received in his arm, witness, wrestled<br>with him, and threw him against the bed, and held him on the<br>floor, and succeeded in taking the knife from him, but got the<br>leader of one of the fingers of the right hand, and the leaders of<br>all the fingers of the left hand cut. He then opened the door<br>and called for assistance, prisoner was not intoxicated at the<br>time. Had never quairelled with the prisoner, nor had any<br>words with the prisoner before he stabbed him.<p>The panel's declaration was read. Among other things it<br>stated that Mr Moftat made up to the prisoner in Giles street, on<br>the morning in question, and accompanied him to his house;<br>that the wound was occasioned by his foot tripping while he had<br>the knife in his hand cutting bread and cheese with it, that in<br>falling he upset the table and cut Mr Moffat's arm. He (declar-<br>ant) was unable to say where he purchased the knife, which ap-<br>peared new and never to have been used for any other purpose.<br>He was unable to account for many other circumstances, and re-<br>fused to answer several pertinent questions.<p>After observations at considerable length from the public<br>prosecutorl in which he shewed the enormity of the crime of<br>which the pannel is guilty, and which was powerfully answered<br>by the pannel's agent, the jury deliberated for a short time, and<br>returned a verdict of guilty.<p>The Lord Justice Clerk previous to pronomncing sentence,<br>dwelt greatly on the heinous nature of the crime of which the<br>pannel is found guilty, and remarked, that had his case been in<br>England, the last sentence of the law would have been awarded<br>against him, his Lordship then delivered the sentence of the<br>law, viz. that he will be transported beyond seas for the period<br>of fourteen years ; and previous to which, to be publicity whipt<br>through the streets of Leith, on Wednesday the 18th February<br>1824&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  </p>
