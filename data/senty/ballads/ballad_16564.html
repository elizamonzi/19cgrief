	<p> Unfortunate Duel.<p>A true and particular Account of a most unfortunate Duel which<br>took place on Tuesday the 26th March, 1822, at  Auchter-<br>toul, in Fife,  in consequence of a Song which appeared in<br>one of the Glasgow Newspapers, when  Sir  Alex.  Boswell<br>of Auchinleck was desperately wounded, and is since dead.<p>ON  Tuesday last, about eleven o'clock forenoon, a meeting took place at Auch-<br>tertool, near Balmutto, between Sir Alexander Boswell of Auchinleck, and Mr.<br>James Stuart of Dunearn. Sir Alexander was attended by Commissioner Douglas,<br>and Mr. Stuart by the Earl of Rosslyn. The Sheriff had heard of it, and the night<br>before it took place, they were bound over to keep the peace. This took place at<br>twelve at night, and on Tuesday morning the one party set off at three, and  the other<br>at four o'clock for Fife, where they met. The parties fired by signal, and Sir Alex-<br>ander received his antagonist's shot in the breast, at the collar bone, which went<br>through and injured the spine, and he instantly fell. Sir Alexander was carried  <br>Balmutto House, where he is attended by Lady Boswell and several surgeons of the<br>first eminence.<p>Another Account.?You will have heard of the meeting which took place between<br>Sir Alex. Boswell, and Mr. James Stuart, attended by Mr. Douglass and Lord Ross-<br>lyn. The meeting took place at ten o'clock on Tuesday morning. The word was<br>given by Lord Rosslyn, and both parties fired at once, when Mr. Stuart's ball entered<br>Sir Alexander's right shoulder, and passing from thence, penetrated downwards to-<br>wards the spine. The distance was twelve paces, and there were two surgeons on the<br>ground. Sir Alexander was afterwards carried to Lord Balmutto's, about two miles<br>distance. The whole parties concerned have gone off.<p>The cause of this Duel is, we hear, a song which appeared in a Glasgow Weekly<br>Newspaper, the Sentinel of the 26th December last. Sir Alexander arrived in Edin-<br>burgh on Saturday last, from London, and the manuscript haying got by some ex-<br>traoidinary means into Mr. Stuart's possession, he soon after met Sir Alexander,<br>and presenting it to him:, asked him if it was his, to which he immediately answered, <br>" Yes." A challenge ensued, and was instantly accepted. Justiciary warrants was<br>immediately issued, and a strict search made in the houses of both Lord Rosslyn<br> and Mr. Stuart, but both had previously fled, and set off for London, from whence<br>it is said, they will proceed to the Continent.<p>The situation where the ball lodged rendered it impossible to be extracted, and<br>he lingered in great pain till Wednesday afternoon about three o'clock, when he ex-<br>pired. Sir Alexander was attended in his last moments by Mrs. Boswell, the situ-<br>ation of whom, and her numerous family, may be conceived, but cannot be described.<p>The sensation which this event has created both in Edinburgh and Glasgow, and<br>we may add, throughout the country, is excessive. Sir Alexander is so Well known,<br>and so universally beloved, that the public has taken a deep interest in his fate on<br>this melancholy occasion.<p>It is said that Mr. Stuart has signified his intention to surrender himself to take his<br>trial whenever he is called upon.<p>The last fatal duel which happened in Scotland, took place betwixt Sir George<p>Ramsay and Captain Macrae of the 14th regiment of foot, in April 1790, when the <br>former was killed, and the latter was indicted, but was outlawed for not appearing.<p>John Muir, Printer.</p>
