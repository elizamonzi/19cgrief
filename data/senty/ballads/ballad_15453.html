	<p> DREADFUL<p>Collision ! !<p>One Hundred and Twenty-two<br>Lives Lost!<p>A full and particular Account<br>of the loss of the Ship Go-<br>vernor Fenner, with Emi-<br>grants for America, which<br>took place off Holyhead,<br>on Saturday Morning last,<br>when 122 Men, Women<br>and Children lost their lives.<p>I t is our painful task to have to record one of the<br>most melancholy disasters which, of late years, has<br>taken place in the channel, and which has been<br>accompanied by the loss of not less than one hun-<br>dred and twenty-two men, women and children.<p>The American ship Governor Fenner, Captain<br>Andrews, which sailed hence on Friday, at noon,<br>for New York, came in contact, on the following<br>morning, at two o'clock, off Holyhead, with the<br>Nottingham, steamer, from Dublin to this port.<br>The ship struck the steamer amidships. So great<br>was the force of the collision, that the ship's bows<br>were stove in, and, in a few minutes from the time<br>of the vessels coming in contact, she sank, the<br>captain and the mate being the only persons, out<br>of 124 souls on board, who saved their lives. The<br>Nottingham was dreadfully shattered, but, having<br>been struck in her strongest part, the collision was<br>not fatal to her.<p>The passengen were all below in their berths<br>when the collision between the ship and the steamer<br>took place. The shock caused by it would, of<br>course, rouse even those who might have been<br>asleep. No doubt they would make a rush towards<br>the deck : the interval, however, which elapsed be-<br>rween the shock and the sinking was so short,<br>scarcely five minutes, that very few, if any could<br>have succeeded in reaching it; so that, in all pro-<br>bability, most of them perished in their berths.<br>The mate, we understand, had been married a few<br>days only before the ship's sailing on her voyage:<br>the captain had given her a berth with her husband<br>in the cabin. When the fate of the ship became<br>inevitable, he attempted to run aft to rescue his<br>wife. Time failed him?the instinct of self-preser-<br>vation became strong?he sprang up the shrouds,<br>and reached the steamer, as we have already stated,<br>by jumping from the foreyard-arm.<p>The Nottingham, which now lies on the east side<br>of the Clarence Dock, was yesterday visited by<br>thousands of curious spectators. Her starboard<br>side is a complete wreck ; even the houses on the<br>deck adjoining are shivered to fragments. The<br>Head animals, cows and sheep, covered the deck,<br>and presented a shocking sight, most of them hav-<br>ing been disembowelled by the concussion which<br>caused their death.?From the Edinburgh Obserwer,<br>Tuesday, 23d February, 1841.</p>
