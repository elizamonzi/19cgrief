	<p> DESPERATE<p>Engagement.<p>An Account of a Most DESPERATE BATTLE which<br>took place on the 13th of April, 1824, between the clans<br>of two Chieftains, between Auchterarder and Fosswell<br>the Battle was for a long while doubtful, till the two<br>generals encountered each other, single-handed, and fought<br>most furiously. At length they both fell covered with<br>wounds, when the Kincardine troops beat a disgraceful<br>retread, and left their gallant Leader to the mercy of his<br>enemies. Taken from the Edinburgh Weekly Chronicle<br>of Wednesday, 5th May, 1824.<p>An ancient estate lying in the immediate neighbourhood of the<br>village of Aucherarder, which in early ages had been the seat<br>of a noble and gallant family, is now the property of an indi-<br>vidual less known in the historical or military world. This<br>chieftain lately conceived that he had a right to a road thro'<br>another chief's lands; on the brae of Fosswell, of least thought<br>it would be advantageous to have so; but learning that he<br>was to be opposed in his purpose, he mnsterad a few of his<br>clan, and directed them to take and keep possession of a par-<br>ticular post, which would be extremely advantageous, and in<br>fact form the key of his army's position in opening the: pro-<br>posed road; which they did, bat were soon dislodged by the<br>Fosswell clief's troops. A warfare ensued betwixt both ar-<br>mies, which lasted for upwards of two weeks, by the post<br>being captured and recaptured almont, daily : so much so, that<br>a general engagewent became  inevitable, in preparing for<br>which, both chiefs summoned the whole of their respective<br> clans, retainers, and dependants, to appear at head quarters<br>on Tuesday, the 13th ult. under the  usual feudal pains of<br>fire and sword, &c, but whether by the.ancient mode of the<br>torch, or other messenger, we have not learned.<p>The awful  day approached,  and tke troops on each side<br>burned with ardour to distinguish themselves in  presence of<br>their leaders!&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But alas ! they were miserably disappointed;<br>for these great chiefs, in place of heading their troops on the<br>day of  action,  placed generals under them&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the evening pre-<br>ceding the engagement,  and retreated to a place of safety, <br>whether from&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hudibras' motive,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" he that fights&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and runs  <br>away, &c." we know not; but be that as it may,  the crmies<br>came in sight of each other about 11 o'clock, A. M,  when a<br>genéral engagement  immediately ensued,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the furiousness  of<br>which,  or the  obstinacy  and  gallantry  displayed  by both<br>sides, it is impossible for us to do justice to ; suffice it to say,<br>that General C. commanding the Kincardine troops, burning<br>for military fame, and regardless of personal danger, advanc-<br>ed before his troops,  overleaped  the enemy's breast-work,<br>and planted his standard within their entrenchments,  where<br>he was immediately encountered,  single-handed,  by General<br>P. commander of the Fosswell troops.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Prodigies of valour<br>were  performed on both sides,  until both these gallant gen-<br>erals fell covered with wounds ; while the Kincardine troops,<br>to their eternal disgrace,  neither sufficiently supported&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;their<br>gallant general,  nor  even&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;attempted&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to  carry him off the<br>field,  but beat a cowardly retreat,  and left him a prisoner in<br>the hanbs of his enemies,  by whom, we are happy to say, he<br>was  treatee with&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;all the attention  and humanity due to his<br>bravery.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<p>It is impossible to distinguish each individual particular.<br>Every one fought as if victory depanded on his single arm ;<br>the. two generals, however, deserve our highest praise. It is<br>evident that General C, imitated the example of Buonaparte<br>and Berthier at the bridge of Lodi...This speaks Volumes.<br>and oar readers, we are sure, will be happy to learn, that<br>both generals, C. and P. are in a fair way of recovery ; altho'<br>it leaves a lasting stigma on their cowardly chiefs to desert<br>such brave men in the day of hattle.<p>PRICE ONE PENNY.</p>
