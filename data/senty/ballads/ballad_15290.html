	<h2>Transcription</h2>
	<p> Life and Memoirs of James Mossat, Who was sen-<br>tenced at Edinburgh to be Executed, and who died<br>in the Calton Jail, on Wednesday se'ennight, con-<br>taining an account of his wicked carreer and Rob-<br>beries in Britain and abroad ; also, an account of<br>the terrible agony be experienced before his Death,<br>and in the course of the night, during which his<br>dreadful exclamations terrified those around him;<br>he was a native of Edinburgh.<p>IT is believed that James M Coul, alias Mossat, alias Martin, alias Wil-<br>son, alias Mossot, was a native of Edinburgh, and was bred to the<br>business of a tanner, which he for some time exercised in this country. He<br>afterwards went to London, where, he connected himself with the most<br>notorious sharpers, and subsequently became himself an adept and a lead-<br>er. He was, like our famous Brodie, celebrated as a cock fighter, and in<br>pugilism, was what would now, in the elegant language of that science. be<br>styled a demi-professional, demi-amateur, of the Fancy. The connections<br>of his gang, of whom the notorious Hasley White was a prominent mem-<br>ber, were, it is said, so extensive, that he might, with some propriety, be<br>called the Robber of the World ; its ramifications extended over great<br>part of the Continent of Europe, himself at times residing in different<br>towns in Holland, He was in Hamburgh when that city fell into the<br>hands of, the French, where he was of considerable service to the British<br>troops, which subsequently saved him from an ignominious death. About<br>fifteen years ago, as a mask for his real intentions, he commenced a mo-<br>rocco tanning and dyeing concern in the neighbourhood of Edinburgh,<br>more, it is thought, with intent of cloaking his character, and assuming a<br>" visible means of subsistence," than for the purpose of fair gain. About<br>that time he was taken into custody, charged with robbing a gentleman in<br>the Theatre, but got of from want of evidence. His history from this<br>period is less perfect with us than in the records of Dow Street, down to<br>the robbery of the Paisley bank's branch at Glasgow. Soon after that<br>transaction he was taken into custody, and after remaining long in Glas-<br>gow Jail, obtained his liberation, by restoring, through the medium of a<br>friend in London, about L. 10,000 of the money of which the bank was<br>robbed ; having, as it is well known, still a large sum of the money then<br>lost to the bank. He made repeated visits to Aberdeen and Dundee, in<br>order to convert the notes into bills on London, in which he succeeded.<br>At lest, with a large sum of money still on his person, he arrived at Leith.<br>and succeeded in converting it also, being, as was proved, the indentical<br>notes of which the bank was robbed, into bills on London, when he was<br>again apprehended and sent up to the Police Office here ; when, after<br>another imprissonment and much discussion, these bills were. by desire of<br>a very active magistrate of this city, lodged in the bank of Sir William<br>Forbes & Co. In order to recover this money, Mossat had the audacity<br>to raise various actions in the Court of Session, and unsuccessfuley lrigat-<br>ed for the period of eight years, during which he was for the most part<br>to be found about the Coutts of Law, or at certain tap-rooms, denouncing<br>city magistrates, judges,and juries. At the final determination of this<br>cause against him in the Jury Court in May las, the witnesses, it will be<br>recollected, so completely established his being a principal in the robbery<br>that he was then taken into custody, tried before the Court of Justiciary<br>in the month of June, convicted, and sentenced to be executed, which <br>sentence was afterwards commuted to transportation.<p>It is said that it was in early youth that those mal practices which had<br>hitherto distinguished his future life were generated, and had finally pro-<br>duced his wretched end. With this man personally, it was perhaps a<br>matter of indifference whether he died on a gibbet or in a prison room; <br>but had he died as a public malefactor, the spectacle would have been tru-<br>ly terrific. It was not the ignominy attached to such a scene, or even the<br>pain attendant on dissolution itself that seemed latterly to awaken his fears,<br>or agitate his mind. The retrospective part of his life furnished such a<br>view of consummate villainy and wickedness, that in his last moments, he<br>exhibited such a picture of agony, that it appeared as if the terrors of an.<br>other world had seized upon him before he had actually quitted this.<br>All that he spoke was with such an air of horror and eagerness as can be<br>scarcely imagined. He was a man that had been possessed of uncommon<br>talents both of body and mind, but which were improved by the very worst<br>of instruments, infidelity, pride, and self-conceit; and it is worthy of re-<br>mark, that Sabbath breaking and mingling in vicious company were a-<br>mongst his early vices, and to which he attributed all his future acts of<br>iniquity. He was capable of great activity and enterprize, but was equal-<br>ly a stranger to affection as to fear; previous to his trial, he trequently said<br>that he knew not what intimidation. was, and that whatever he was inclined<br>to he prosecuted without remorse or dread of consequences ; but this seem-<br>ed greatly to forsake him after he was laid under sentence of death. Al-<br>though he affected to be calm in his mind, yet he gradually lost his bodily<br>strength ; there was a secret working within that gave, him unceasing pain<br>This he often expressed by grinding his teeth and other marks of agony.<br>He seldom read any, and had no relish for religious exercises; though not<br>an open infidel, his mind was alienated from God, and his hopes of tuturi-<br>ry only presumption. When left to himself his days were agonising and<br>his nights terrible. This greatly increased as his mental vigour declined<br>and conscience acquired strength. When the mind reverted on past en-<br>ormities, he became afraid of himself and felt pain not to be uttered; par-<br>ticularly during the night season he used to, fight with his arms, and to<br>shake his limbs; under those paroxysms he swore and exclaimed bitterly,<br>frequently crying out, 'Depart from me ye Devils, ye monsters and com-<br>panions of my guilt-' to the alarm and terror of all within hearing. His<br>heart seemed hard and secure to the las:, as he lived, so he appeared to die<br>without God and without hope.<p>He died in the city Jail on Wednesday seenight, and was interred in the calton<br>burial groung on. Sabbath afternoon, at 4 o'clock, when's great number of people<br>were assembled from curiosity to witness the interment.</p>
