	<h2>Transcription</h2>
	<p> An account of the Execution of Charles<br>M'Ewan at Edinburgh, on Wednesday<br>the 7th April, for the Murder of Mar.<br>garet Money, on the Firmonth Hill,<br>in Aberdeenshire, with his behaviour<br>in Jail, and at the place of Execution.<p>Edinburgh, Wednesday, 7th April, 1824.<p>This morning, pursuant to his sentence, Charles M'Ewan under-<br>went the last awful sentence of the law, for the inhuman murder<br>of Margaret Money, with whom he had cohabited as' her husband.<p>During his trial he seemed quite unaffected, and after being<br>taken to his cell he was quite sullen. A number of Pious Gen-<br>tlemen visited him, with the humane intention of endeavouring<br>to awaken him to a sense of his awful situation. Instead of re-<br>ceiving them with pleasure, he treated them in the coldest man-<br>ner, and told them that if he had done the deed it was a matter<br>of his own and none of theirs. The unhappy man continued in<br>this state till within a few days back, when he beg-in entertain<br>feelings better suited to his situation. Lately he had been daly<br>visited by three Catholic Clergymen with whom much of his<br>time was cousumed; and to their exhortations must be ascribed<br>the change in his behaviour He had become more tranquil and<br>social ; but continued to discover a lamentable ins-nsibility to the<br>fate which awaited him. When in a talkative mood, he spoke<br>boastingly of his athletic exploits in the Highlands; and was fe-<br>miliar with the names of all the English pugilists. He expressed<br>great anxiety concerning the late of the impending battle betwixt<br>Spring and Langan ; and a few days ago, after having been shaved<br>he invited the barber to spar with him, which of course was de-<br>clined. Once a week he was visited by a near relation residing<br>in Leith, who had attemped in vain to engage him in some suit-<br>able conversation. Every attention had been paid to his comfort,<br>but he seemed to draw his clief temporal solace from a tobacco<br>pipe, which he was almost continually smoking.<p>On Tuesday afternoon, at half-past five, the unfortunate man<br>wat conveyed from the Calton Jail to the Lock-up-house, prepar-<br>atory to the execution of his sentence. Before leaving this place<br>of confinement, he was visited by some friends, one of whom, who<br>has shown him great attention, was with him again this morning<p>The Scaffold was e'rected, as usual, during the night, and in the<br>morning a great concourse of people surrounded the fatal spot.<p>About 10 minutes past eight the prisoner walked with a firm<br>step to the stage of death, accompanied by the magistrates. and<br>clergymen of the persuasion to which he adhered. Here he ac-<br>quiesced in the justness of his sentence, and hoped his fate would<br>be a Warning to others. The devotional exercises being over, the<br>drop fell, and the lamp of life was for ever extinguished. His<br>body was delivered to Dr Monro for dissection.<p>The unhappy man was a native of Ireland, and his real name<br>was M'Eoch, but he took the names of Robert M'Leod. John<br>M'Intyre, Charlos M'Intosh, Charles M'Kay, and Charles M'Ewan<br>according as circumstances suited, but he was best known by the<br>latter. He and a number of his relations left Ireland about ten<br>years back, and travelled in Scotland as tinklers. He pitched upon<br>the north of Scotland as the best country to carry on his trade.<br>In the shires of Aberdeen, Inverness, &c. he was soon well known<br>and to many that lived in remote places, having heard of during<br>deeds committed by him, his appearance in their cottage would<br>throw a dampness over them. He was the terror of all the vagrant<br>travellers in that quarter, and it is said he would help himself at<br>pleasure to part of their goods if they were at a distance from the<br>hands of justice. This and his readiness in giving battle to any<br>that opposed him got him the appelation of " the Cock of the<br>North." He has lived with various women as man and wife ;<br>the one he lived longest with, has 3 children. The unfottunate<br>woman whom he murdered had at that time been only 3 or 4 days<br>co-habiting with him at that time. After committing the bloody<br>deed, he became restless, which was observed in the various<br>houses he sleeped in afterwards.<p>Edinburgh, Prined for the Booksellers.<p></p>
