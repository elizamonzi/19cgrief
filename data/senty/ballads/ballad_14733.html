	<p> Life, Transactions, and Execution of Thomas Connor and Bell<br>M'Mencmy, Executed at Glasgow for Assault and Robbery.<p>GLASGOW, 22d OCTOBER, 1828.?This morning, THOMAS CONNOR and<br>BELL M'MENEMY were Executed in front of the Court Houses, convicted at the<br>last Assizes of the crime of Assault and Rebbery.<p>It may be recollected that M'Menemy, on her trial, pleaded Guilty to the charge<br>of decoying a Highland boatman of the name of M'Kinnon, to the banks of the Ca-<br>nal, near Port-Eglinton, on the morning of the 20th May last, to which place, Con-<br>nor, by previous compact, followed, where, after cruelly maltreating their victim,<br>and knocking him on the head with a stone, to the great effusion of his blood, they<br>robbed him of forty shillings in silver, which the poor Highlander had secreted in.<br>the leg of one of his stockings.<p>Connor, who was 21 or 22 years of age, was born in the County of Tyrone, Ire-<br>land. The officers of justice describe him as being a bad boy ever since he was able<br>to crawl, and that this should have been the case there is no wonder whatever, for his<br>mother encouraged her son, even from his boyish days, in evil practices, and when-<br>ever he committeed an act more characterized by dexterity and skilful depravity than<br>another, he was sure to be rewarded by the caresses and applause of this most aban-<br>doned and most unnatural woman. Such being the footing on which this unfortu-<br>nate young man was placed at home, it would  be endless to relate all his petty depre-<br>dations and misdeeds; suffice it to say, that he was  some years ago banished forth<br>from the County of Renfrew for stealing an anvil and a cart wheel from a  smith in<br>Mearns, but it was never known by what means he succeeded in making away with<br>the anvil, as it would have required three men at least to have removed it to any con-<br>siderable distance. At another period of his guilty career he was banished from<br>Glasgow for theft; and on the 12th May, 1826, he was tried at the Circuit Court here<br>for robbing a man of the sum of L.2 3s., but escaped by a verdict of Not Proven.?<br>The danger he had escaped was immediately forgot, and any slight impression which<br>had been made by his long consinement?the ceremony and solemnity of the trial?<br>and the doubts and uncertainty he felt regarding his fate, were speedily effaced by<br>the decision with which his fears and his better feelings were always treated by his<br>cruel and unrelenting parent?she goaded him on in his guilty and unreflecting ca-<br>reer, until the commission of the deed which brought him to the gallows.<p>With this depraved young man, Bell M'Menemy,when she came to Scotland in<br>the year 1821, got acquainted through the medium of another female, and shortly af-<br>terwards, with his mother. Previous to this period no crime was ever imputed to her, <br>and she had been creditably and industriously employed at a Steam loom Factory<br>From the day her friendship with Connor and his mother began, this unfortunate<br>female herself dated all her wickedness, aud all her misfortunes; she was hurried<br>on from one crime to another with a rapidity which gave her no time for reflection;<br>and she frequently acknowledged after her condemnation, that she had been guilty of<br>many actions which, in her own apprehension, were as criminal as that for which she<br>was about to suffer. She had been once in bridewell for stealing a watch. She was a<br>good looking woman, about 23 years of age, fair complexion, with red hair, and also<br>came from the county of Tyrone.<p>Since the condemnation of the unhappy prisoners, who were both Catholics, they<br>were frequently visited by Bishop Scott, Messrs. M'Grigor and M'Donald, and alto-<br>gether they behaved with much propriety, and listened to the religious advice of these<br>gentlemen with seeming penitence, especially the female prisoner, who seemed to be<br>from the questions she asked, not only a sensible, but a shrewd young woman.<p>They were recommended to mercy by the Jury on account of their youth, and pe-<br>titions were transmitted to the proper quarter for a commutation of ther sentence,<br>but without effect, on learning which the female wept bitterly for some time.<p>Soon after 8 o'clock the unhappy culprits ascended the fatal scaffold, attended by<br>the Rev. Gentlemen who visited them in their lonely cell. They were both decently<br>clad in mournings. The apparatus of death having been finally adjusted, the prison-<br>ers shook hands, and asked forgiveness of each other, and after  a short pause, the<br>signal was given, when the drop fell, and after a  few struggles, they ceased to exist.<br>It was altogether a melancholy scene.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  <p>The crowd, as might have been expected, was much greater than usual, on account<br>of the execution of a female, which is fortunately a very rare occurrence in Glasgow,<br>as it is just 61 years since Agnes Dougal was  executed at the Howgathead for mur-<br>der, who is the first woman of whom there is any record of having been capitally pu-<br>nished here; and the last was Agnes White for murder, in 1793, so that it is 35 years<br>since a woman was executed here before.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; John Muir, printer Glasgow.</p>
