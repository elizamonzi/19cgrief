	<p> Dreadful & Fatal<br>Pitched Battle.<p>An account of a most dreadful and fatal Piched Battle which<br>was fought on Monday last, at Childshill, near London, be-<br>tween Davis and Winkworth, when Winkworth was killed,<br>and warrants  were issued against a number of pugilists, among<br>whom were Byrne, Reynolds  and Spring.?Glasgow, 4th<br>August, 1820.<p>Within the last fortnight, a match was made for L. 5 a side, beween Frederickt<br>Winkworth and Jack Davis, known as the Slashing Painter, both from the vicinity<br>of Tottenham Court-Road. The fight took place at Childshill, near London, where<br>a ring being formed they proceeded to business. Davis has the best of the firs<br>five rounds, and in the sixth he was sent down from a body blow, at which Wink-<br>worth's friends were quite uprorious. Davis had the best of it until the eighteenth<br>round, when good counter hits were delivered on both sides. Winkworth, hawer-<br>er, was too far gone to take advantage of any success; still he fought, and was<br>worsted up to the 24th round, when he repeated a dose upon the right  eye of Da-<br>vis. In the 27th round Winkworth again dropped upon Davis's already damaged<br>eye, but could not keep his opponent out. In the 38th round Davis  gave him a<br>complete cross  and fell upon him with all his weight, shaking his whole frame. In<br>the 40th round he was sent down instanter from a right hander on the left jaw. It<br>was now evident he had no further chance, but he still persisted in fighting on,<br>which he did to the 58th round, when he could fight no more, Davis was conse-<br>quently declared the victor.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  <p>The qght lasted one hour and five minutes. Winkworth was conveyed to an inn<br>where be was bled, but the unfortunate fellow lingered till the following day at 4<br>o'clock, when he expired. <p>Information having been given to Messrs. Hoare and Bosanquet, Magistrates re-<br>sident at Hampstead, those gentlemen immediately issued their warrant against six-<br>teen persons, pugilists and amatecurs, who were recognised as having been present,<br>and on Tuesday night Bill Eales (who was charged with being one of the men who<br>kept the riug ) Paddy Flynn, one of the seconds, and Davis, were apprehended, and<br>brought before them, charged with the murder of Frederick Winkworth.<p>The Coroner's inquest was held, and a verdict of Manslaughter returned against<br>Davies the principal, and the four seconds.<p>The Coroner issued his Warrant for their committal to take their trials for the of-<br>fence, and the Witnesses were bound over to prosecute and give evidence on the<br>trial.<p>On the next day Mr. Hoare, by whom Ealcs was committed, proceeded  to  Clerk-<br>enwell prison  and  discharged  him  upon  bail.  He  intimated,  however  that  it was<br>his  ietention to prosecute all the parties against whom he had issued warrants for a<br>misdemeanour.  We  understand  that  Tom  Spring, who was present by mere acci-<br>dent, Simon Byrne, Tom Reynolds, and  several gentlemen are included  in this<br>threat.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;John  Muir printer, Glasgow.</p>
