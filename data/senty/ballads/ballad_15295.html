	<p> EXECUTION !<p>A Full and Particular Account of JOHN DEMP-<br>SEY, late Private Soldier in the 13th Regiment of<br>Infantry, who was Executed at Edinburgh, on Wed-<br>nesday morning, the 13th December, 1820, for Mur-<br>der, committed at Greenock, in July last, and his Bo-<br>dy given for Dissection ; including his Behaviour at<br>the place of Execution.<p>THIS unfortunate man, JOHN DEMPSEY, it will be recollect-<br>ed, was tried at Edinburgh, before the High Court of Juati-<br>ciary, on Monday the 6th of November last, along with four others,<br>all privates in the 13th Regiment of Foot, for the murder of Ro-<br>bert Simpson, Henry Pearson, and Arahibald Morison, who were<br>shot, in a squabble that took place at Greenock, very early in the<br>morning of the 31st day of July last, between them and a party of<br>sailors and others, After a very long and interesting crial, which<br>occupied the Court upwards of ninteen hours, Dempsey and Ro-<br>bert Surrage were both found Guilty of the murder of Simpson<br>and Pearson only, there being no direct proof as to the death of<br>Morrison, and sentenced to be Executed at Edinburgh, on Wednes-<br>day morning, the 13th December, 1820, between the hours of 8<br>and 10 o'clock, and their bodies to  be delivered over to the Profes-<br>sor of Anatomy for dissection; but the Jury unanimously recom-<br>mended Surrage to mercy, and the sentence passed upon him has<br>since been commuted into banishment for life. The other three,<br>after an impressive admonition, were dismirred from the her the<br>libel being found Not proven against them.<p>Dempsey and his companions were part of a detachment of the<br>13th Foot, stationed at Greenock for a short time last summer; and,<br>as appeared from the evidence at the trial, had been drinking together<br>till very late on the evening of the 30th July. On their way home<br>to their quarters, they fell in with some sailors and women, with<br>whom they had had some altercation, and immediately a mob col-<br>lected about them, when some severe blows were given and receiv-<br>ed on both sides. The soldiers then precipitately retired to their<br>lodgings, followed by the mob, and some of them were knocked<br>down before the door was opened. Upon gaining admission,. they<br>ran up stairs, and some of them soon appeared at a window, with<br>their firelocks in their hands, when several shots were fired, and the<br>three unfortunate men above mentioned were killed. The Guard<br>of the detachment arrived soon afterwards, and took the soldiers<br>immediately into custody.<p>Accordingly this unhappy man appeared very much affected when<br>the awful sentence of the law was pronounced against him, having<br>been solemnly assured that he need not expect any mitigation of<br>the punishment then awarded him. He was very penitent, and ap-<br>peared perfectly sensible of,as well as thankful for the kindness<br>and attention shewn him since his condemnation by several of the<br>clergymen of the City, as well as many "private individuals, and<br>particularly by the clergy and several other persons of his own re-<br>ligious persuasion residing in Edinburgh,  who  often visited him in<br>his solitary confinement He was a good looking young man, a rs-<br>tive of Ireland, apparently about twenty-five years of age, unmar-<br>ried we believe, and of the Roman Catholic Religion.<p>Edinburgh, 13th Dec. 1820.-?This morning, pursuant to his<br>sentence, John Dempsey was executed here, at the ordinary place<br>of execution, head of Libberton Wynd, Lawnmarket, opposite the<br>head of Bank Street. The unfortunate man, who was previously<br>waited upon, at the Lock-up-house, by two clergymen, where some<br>religious preparation had been made, was conducted up the Wynd tc<br>the scaffold, attended by the officiating Magistrates in their gowns,<br>preceded by their officers, accompanied by the Clerglymen, and<br>guarded by a strong detachment of Police officers, a little past<br>eight o'clock. After prayers, by one of the reverend gentlemen at-<br>tending, to whom he seemed to speak seriously for a short time, he<br>bowed respctfully to the magistrates, and shook hands with some<br>of those around him, and then mounted the drop, assisted by a<br>clergyman, where he continued for a few minutes in most earnest<br>and fervent prayer. He then exclaimed, " Gentlemen, I am inno-<br>cent of the crime charged against me," dropt the fetal signal, and<br>was instantly launched into eternity, about half past eight -' clock ;<br>amidst few spectators comparatively, owing to the earliness of  the<br>hour. After hanging the usual time, the body was cut down, and<br>sent to the College to be dissected.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <p>Edinburgh?Printed  for R.Watson,?PRICE ONE PENNY.</p>
