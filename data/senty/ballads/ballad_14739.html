	<p> EXECUTION.<p>The&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Behaviour,  Execution, and  Life  and  Transactions&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of  GEORGE<p>DUFFY, who suffered at Glasgow on the 7th Nov. 1832, for the cruel<p>and brutal&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Murder of his own Wife, in Drygate Street, in May last.<p>GLASGOW, 7th Nov. 1832.<p>This day, the above unfortunate individual<br>suff red in front o' the Jail here. The following<br>is the substance of the way and manner in which<br>he committed this horrid and  brutal deed :?<p>George Duffy was indicted for the murder of<br>Helen Broadly, or Duffy, his wife, having vio-<br>ently seized her person, and by force carried her<br>to and threw her upon the  fire and held her<br>thereon, or close thereto, where by she was so,<br>severely burnt  in the back, belly, legs. and other<br>parts of the body, as to lineer  from 14t h M ay to<br>9th June, when she died?he having for several<br>months  previous used her with great cruelty<p>Alexr Godan, weaver, deponed, that he and<br>his wife lodged for eight months previous to May<br>last, to the same house with pannel  and his wife.<br>who occupied the kitchen, while he occupied the<br>room, which entened through the kitchen ; bad<br>full opportunity of knowing on what terms  Duffy<br>and his wife lived; he was very violent in  his<br>temper, especialy to her; has seen him thresh<br>her, and was twice obliged to interfere to sade<br>her; she was seldom without  marks of violence<br>upon her body ; Duffy was seldom sober ; recel<br>lec's of him being once sober for three days to<br>gether. Mrs. Duffy took a dram sometimes; saw<br>her only once tipsy ; her temper was easy; she<br>did not provoke her husband?during the three<br>days that I saw him so er, he used  his wife very<br>harshly?saw him on two occasions knock her<br>down?he felled her to the floor. One day she<br>had gone out with another person, and on her<br>return  Duffy took her to account, and said he<br>would burn her. She was industrious and had<br>to work for herself and did every things for her<br>husband beside. He dra  k all his earnings  com-<br>monly?she washed cleaned houses, and any<br>thing for industry and shared it with  her hus-<br>band. She was a  little neat woman, about five<br>feet high. He was asked  if he recollected  any<br>thing particular happening on  14th May ? Ano-<br>ther women came to ask for some money from<br>Duffy, and his wife and this women went to seek<br>him. Witness came he me about nine o'clock;<br>as he came through the kitchen, Mrs. D. was in<br>bed; heard her husband say to her. 'you-<br>come out of that of I'd  haill  you to -."-<br>Thought is presence night stop him from worse,<br>as it had done it before, and went  into the kit-<br>chen to light  his pipe, and draw pannel into con-<br>veisation.  Deceased moaned much as in  distress,<br>and said in all probability she  would  not see<br>another day. Duffy said, I wish to God I had<br>you to bury tomorrow She continued to moan<br>the whole night ; perceived an uncommon smell<br>through that night, for which he could not ac-<br>count ; it was a burnt like smell-went to work<br>next morning at five?gave deceased a drink of<br>water, at her request , as he passed out ? saw her<br>in bed where he resumed at nine to breakfast?<br>and at two saw her on a seat  by the fire with her<br>shift on, and petticoat  loose on her shoulders.?<br>She called me, and said  Saunders. will you be so<br>good as go and make  application to get me into<br>the Infirmary ? I asked her, what's wrong now ?<br>She said, my pain is so sore?and said  she must<br>show me her body. She 'ted up her shift and<br>shewed her body ; it was in a shocking state;<br>the skin of the thighs and lower part of the body<br>Was off and  all rawflesh; she  then turned round<br>and shewed me her back; her  loins and poste-<br>riors were in the same state I asked her how<br>this had happened ? she said George had  given<p>her a beating ?had torn up her clothes, and put<br>her on the fire. George was in bed; went and<br>pushed him to waken him, and said what's this<br>you have done?you have settled her now?she's<br>terribly burnt?she's roasted ? He said, swear-<br>ing, she's not half roasted ; she has taken a half<br>crown from my pocket, and this is the rent day.<br>She said now God will reward you, George. I<br>asked him to get a Doctor, and have her wounds<br>dressed. He said he had no money; asked him<br>to get some ointment and dress it himself, but he<br>did not. He never denied roasting her. I went<br>to work, and told him, that if he did not have<br>her dressed before an hour, I would report her<br>to the infirmary and hint to the Police?picked<br>same parts of cinder from the lower parts of her<br>body?applied to have her to the Infirmary, and<br>w is successful?helped her?she took half an<br>hour?might have gone in two minutes but from<br>her weakness.<p>This statement was borne out in all its parts<br>by Mrs. Gollan, Dr. Stirling, the Nurse, Clerk,<br>and Surgeon of the Infirmary, and many other<br>witnesses. The prisoner was unanimously found<br>Guilty, and after an impressive address from the <br>Lord Justice Clerk, who characterised this crime<br>as the most atrocious case of brutal cruelty and<br>savage  barbarity that had ever come under his<br>observation, sentenced him to be Executed on<br>the 7th November, between the hours of 2 and<br>4, and his body buried within the precincts of <br>the jail.<p>Agreeably to this sentence, the prisoner was<br>brought  to the scaffold at the hour appointed,<br>attended  by the Clergy of the&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;persuasion&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;he<br>belonged to, and after spending a short time in<br>prayer on  the fatal drop, it fell&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and in a few<br>moments he became a lifeiess corpse.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After the<br>body had been suspended the usual time, it was<br>cut down and conveyed back to the jail, for the<br>purpose of being buried within its precincts, in<br>terms of the new Act.<p>Since his conviction, he conducted himself in<br>a manner becoming his awful situation, and the<br>horrid  nature of the crime he had to atone for.?<br>He was very penitent and resigned, and ascribes<br>all his past misconduct to the effects arising from<br>intemperance, which made him callous to every<br>feeling of humanity?caused him to ill-use and<br>cruelly beat his wife?and at lengtn led him to<br>commit that horrid crime which the laws of his<br>country could visit with no other punishment<br>than death.<p>He professed to believe in the tenets of the<br>Church of Rome, (though in practice, as well as<br>persons of all sects), he grossly perverted them.<br>He was assisted in his religious exercises by the<br>Reverend Bishop Scott, the Rev: Mr. Murdoch.<br>&c. to whose in-cructions and admonitions he<br>listened with the utmostattention and eagerness;<p>He originally belonged to a place called Green<br>Castle in Ireland, but has been residing in this<br>country these number of  years, and has lived a<br>considerable time in Drygate Street, the place  <br>where the murder was perpetrated. He was a<br>man of low stature, about 45 years of age, and<br>his employment was cleaning of closses and emp-<br>tving of dungsteads, or any other out-door work.<br>He has left a daughter about 14 years old.<p>A crime, perpetrated with such horrid bruta-<br>lity, has seldom been recorded, and we trust will<br>never occur again. It ought to  be a warning to<br>drunkards to person of hasty passion, and to<br>old and young?for all need advice. <p>Wm, Carse , Printer, Glasgow.</p>
