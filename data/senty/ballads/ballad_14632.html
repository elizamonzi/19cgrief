	<p> THE MURDERED MAN,<p>ROBERT TENNANT.<p>WILLIAM PEDDIE.<p>Copy of the Melancholy and Sorrowful LAMENTATION of ROBERT<br>TENNANT, the young man who is now confined in the Jail of<br>Stirling, and who is to be Executed there on the morning of<br>Wednesday the 2d of October, 1833, for the bloody Murder<br>of William Peddie, an old man, about 70 years of age, on<br>the high road between Beancross and Kerse Toll, parish of<br>Falkirk, on the evening of the 3d of August last.<p>ROBERT TENNANT is a young man about 24 years of age, was a labour-<br>er, and employed in breaking stones on the toll road, between Beancross<br>and Kerse Toll, in the parish of Falkirk, when the unfortunate circumstances<br>of the murder took place. William Paddie, the deceased, was about 70 years<br>old, a labourer also, and likewise employed on the same road, on which he was<br>foreman. On the forenoon of the 3d of August, the day on which the murder<br>was committed, Peddie was instructed to dismiss Tennant from the work, by<br>Mr Borth wick, the superintendant of that district of road, because that, although<br>the deceased had before prevailed on the superintendant to keep him on the<br>road, it was evident that his drinking and irregularity rendered him unfit to be<br>longer employed, and had been at that moment, 12 o'clock noon, lying drunk<br>on the footpath opposite the toll, apparently fast asleep. When he awoke, and<br>this instruction was communicated to him, the altercation commenced, which<br>ended in the murder of the poor old man,<p>Ye fellow men, pray view the end,<p>Of those who live in crime,<br>They range abroad without a friend,<p>And die before their time.<br>The dreadful scaffold does unfold<p>A lesson to the young ;<br>It paints in language seldom told,<p>That crime will stop the tongue.<br>When pinion'd fast, the awful view<p>Does damp the prisoner's heart,<br>But little thought spectators take,<p>It leaves no lasting smart.<p>But as I shortly suffer must,<p>My sentence justly due,<br>I leave this last advice to all<p>That my sad end may view.<br>You mothers that have tender hearts,<p>Your children watch with care;<br>Instruct them early in those parts<p>That lead from sinful snare.<br>Now from my dark and dismal cell,<p>I warn this sinful race,<br>To fly from crime, and strive to dwell<p>In unity and peace.<br>May God above support you all,<p>And guide you by his grace,<br>Till you arrive, both great and small,<p>In realms of endless peace.<br>And when my awful end you view,<p>Take warning by my fate,<br>And every day the thought renew,<p>Before it be too late.<br>0 Saviour of mankind, stretch forth<p>Thine everlasting arms,<br>And save me from the second death<p>With all its dire alarms.<p>Justice now has overtook me,<br>Stopp'd me in my wicked race ;<p>Guilt and Horror has pursued me,<br>And now look me in the face.<p>Judge of judges ! King of Glory !<p>0  ! how dreadful is my fate,<br>Summon'd to appear before thee,<p>In this guilty awful state,<br>On the third of August last,<p>I  to a fair did go,<p>Which was the awful cause of all<p>My bitterness and woe.<br>At Grangemouth this fair was held,<p>Listen to what I say,<br>Peddie I met when I returned,<p>And him I then did slay.<br>If my days were to begin again,<p>I to the world would show,<br>That I would shun the paths of sin,<p>Wherein destroyers go.<p>But O ! these days are past and gone,<p>In fetters here I lie,<br>In a strong cell I am confin'd,<p>By men I am doom'd to die.<br>Because God's laws I did transgress,<p>And would not walk therein,<br>But shun'd the paths of righteousness.<p>And trod the paths of sin.<br>My days are now fast fleeting by,<p>The hour draws on apace,<br>No earthly mercy now is nigh.<p>Death stares me in the face.<br>Farewell, my friends, we now must sever,<p>The thought lies heavy at my heart,<br>Forget my awful end for ever,<p>I from you soon must part..&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<p>EDINBURGH :,...Menzies, Lawnmarket.,...Price One Penny.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
