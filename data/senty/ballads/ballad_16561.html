	<h2>Transcription</h2>
	<p> An account of the Execution of that Horrid Villain JOHN THOMAS, Who<br>was. Hanged in front of York prison, on Tuesday the 16th of<br>January 1822, for the inhuman, murder of Margaret Thomson, a far-<br>mer's, wife, and of Mary Harris, a girl of eleven years of age:?Also,<br>his Dying Speech at the place of execution.<p>ON Tuesday the 16th of January, 1822,<br>John Thomas was executed at Whitehaven,<br>for repeated acts of cruelty and murder.<p>The crimes for which this depraved wretch<br>suffered were attended with circumstances of<br>uncommon barbarity; and, had they not been<br>acknowledged by himself, when on the brink<br>of eternity, it would not be credited that a man<br>so devoid of feeling, so totally savage in his.<br>mind, could be found in a civilized country.<p>The murders for which he was tried and<br>condemned, were well known to the public<br>some time ago; and which coupled with the<br>discoveries he made after his condemnation,<br>had a powerful effect in exciting a general;<br>curoisity to see the perpetrator of so many at-<br>rocious and most inhuman offences?of course,<br>the number of spectators assembled at the<br>place of execution, was greatly beyond what<br>has been observed on an ordinary occasion.<p>Although this wretched man must have been<br>extremely hardened while leading his career of<br>unexampled wickedness, he at last, through<br>the unwearied endeavours of several pious and<br>worthy gentlemen who attended him after his<br>condemnation, became sensible of the magni-<br>tude of his iniquities, declared his sorrow for<br>the crimes be had committed, expressed hopes<br>of forgiveness from Almighty God, and died<br>very penitently. <p>One of the murders for.which he was exe-<br>cuted was that of Margaret Thomson, an old<br>woman, and the wife of a respectable farmer.<br>Thomas, entered the house when the unfortun-<br>ate woman was alone; and she being then en-<br>gaged in some domestic concern, with her<br>back towards the door (which had been open<br>for some time previous) did not immediately<br>perceive him. Of this circumstance the villain<br>took a fatal advantage; he came softly behind<br>the poor woman, and knocked her down by a<br>blow on the head from a bill-hook, after which<br>he dispatched her by repeated blows, giving<br>her several dreadful wounds. As. soon as he<br>perceived she was dead, he searched her pock.<br>ets, took out her keys, and went up stairs, where<br>he unlocked a chest of drawers, took out a suit<br>of her husband's clothes, in which he deliber-<br>ately dressed himself, leaving his own, covered<br>with the blood of the murdered woman, in their<br>place and then quietly walked away!<p>After this bloody transaction, he proceeded<br>towards Dodsbrooke. In the evening he met<br>a girl, about eleven years of age, on the road.<br>He inquired if she could shew him the way to<br>the next village, and, at the same time pro-<br>mised ber a penny if she would accompany him,<p>as he was afraid he would miss the proper road,<br>day-light being nearly withdrawn<p>The unsuspecting child, whose name was<br>Mary Harris, and who belonged to one of the<br>villages, complied with the monster's request,<br>and went with him toward next village.<p>They had  not proceeeded [&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;] on the road,<br>when he suddenly se[&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;]celess guide,,<br>and dragged her int[&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ]ng enclosure,<br>where he attempted [&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;]; her&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;erson; but,<br>owing to the resistan[&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;]made, he did not<br>accomplish his purpose.<p>Finding himself disappointed in the first part<br>of his designs, he immediately proceed to<br>the perpetration of the second, and  which,<br>perhaps, for disgracefulness and blood thirsty<br>cruelty, was never exceeded by the- most pro-<br> fligate villain.<p>He searched about till he procured a heavy<br>stick, with which he returned to his already ex-<br>hausted victim and literally beat out her brainst!<br>It being now quite dark, he acknowledged that,<br>he ascertained the fact of having beat her head<br>in pieces by feeling it over with his hand.<p>He then proceeded to strip the body, which<br>he disengaged of every article of clothing, tak-<br>ing off the very shirt, and tied all up in his<br>handkerchief He proceeded to a neighbour-<br>ing pool of water to wash himself, and disco-.<br>vering that the unfortunate girl's shirt was<br>greatly stained with blood, he threw it into a<br>hedge, and left it behind him. he was soon<br>after apprehended; a reward of two hundred<br>guineas being offered for his apprehension,<br>when he confessed the above, and several other<br>shocking murders.<p>His Dying Speech at the Place of Execution.<br>Good people, you are come to see my shame-<br>ful and untimely end, which, I confess, has de-<br>servedly fallen upon me, as the just judgment,<br>of the righteous of all the earth for the deepest<br>crimes; I beseech you to take warning by my<br>fall; beware of the subtile ways of the enemy of<br>our souls, going always about like a roaring<br>lion seeking whom he may devour. In my in-<br>fant years, not regarding God's holy words,<br>but wilfully breaking the Sabbath, I delighted<br>more to be at the alehouse with bad company,<br>than at the church. I becoming totally de-<br>praved, I committed the horrid murders for<br>which my heart now bleeds within me. I ear-nestly<br>nestly entreat all young persons to avoid Sab-<br>bath-breaking, drunkenness, and disobedience<br>to their parents, and to beware of lustful  desires<br>and the company of lewd women, who will<br>betray them to ruin.<p>Printed by John Muir.</p>
