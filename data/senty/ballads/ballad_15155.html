	<p> Particular Account of the Execution and behaviour of a young man, named David Wylle, who suffer<br>ed at; Glasgow, on Wednesday the 12th November<br>1823, for Housebreaking and Theft, with his<br>Warning to the young to beware of the numerous<br>gangs of thieves who art at present committing<br>crimes through the country, also his affectionate<br>address on the scaffold.<p>Glasgow, Wednesday, Nov. 12th, l823<p>This day, the above unfortunate young man underwent the aw-<br>ful sentence of death, for being a partner in the expensive theft,<br>aggravated  by housebreaking, from the house occupied by James<br>Herbert Rodgers, Esq. Gordon Street, Glasgow. This young<br>man was libelled along with 'David' Dunsmore, Ann Dunsmore,<br>his wife, William Johnston, John Toy, and James Perguson, all<br>concerned in different ways of plundering and resetting the fol-<br>follwing, articles;..The family had gone to sea-bathing quarters<br>on the 19th of Sept. 1822, and did not return till the 19th Oct. <br>Following, when they found their house completely ransacked, all<br>the locks forced off the press doors, and all the plate, gold and<br>silver coin, wearing apparel, &c. carried off, Wylie and Johnston<br>were found Guilty and sentenced to be Executed, but the latter<br> has since been respited. Dunsmore and his wife were transported<br>for 14 years; Toy to be imprisoned for 18 months in Bridewell ;<br>and Ferguson was outlawed. This was one of the most extensive<br>thefts which has been committed for a long time, and their con-<br>nexion is said to have extended a considerable way.<p>This young man's conduct since sentence was passed upon  him,<br>has been in every respect  highly becoming his future  prospects,<br>and contrition for his past life; the thought of time mis-spent, of<br>crimes committed, of acquaintances whom he once loved, separat-<br>ed from him for ever, and finally, the parting with those parents<br>a very composed  manner,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;decently attired; after  viewing the<br>surrounding multitude, he took an affectionate  farewel of them,<br>observing, " The crowd&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;which&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I  now behold,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I once mingled<br>among, to behold the end of some&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;wretched victim  or victims;<br>at that time I little though at a fare  like theirs  would&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;so soon be<br>mine."&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After a&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;few minoutes spent in  prayer, he gave  the  last<br>signal  was thrown off.  and his struggles in time ended.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At the<br>"who counselled,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;instructed,  and by every tic which links human<br>nature together, warned him of impending danger ; all these weigh-<br>ed heavily on his  mind,  and impressed in a variety of shapes the<br>awful situation  in which he had  placed himself; but the  gospel<br>has a  balm for every wound, a hope for every fear, an eternity off<br>happiness  for a dark day of adversity,  and a change of earthly<br>pursuits for&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;heavenly joys;  all-these,  aided by the valuable  in-<br>strctions of several Ministers of the city, and the kind treatment<br>ef pious and benevolent friends, (especially of those under whose<br>immediate care  he was placed,) dispelled his doubts,  animated<br>his hopes,  and enabled him&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to look&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;forward with exultation  to<br>that change which awaited him.<p>From the hour of condemnation, to the hour he appeared on<br>the ignominous board, he has (we anxiously hope) fully atoned<br>for his bypast life....Ministers exhorted, prayed, and offered up<br>praises in his behalf during the time he was confined in his soli<br>tary room ; and the devotions of the hall, which continued for<br>about an hour, in reading, prayer and praise, fully prepared him<br>for ascending the fatal drop, which he did about three o'clock in<br>time when his companion received the respite, language cannot<br>pourtray the feelings which predominated in his youthful breast,<br>it affected him more then the sentence itself.<p>During the time of his confinement, he told those who visited<br>him, to warn the youth of the city to beware bad company, es-<br>pecially resetters, who haunt young  men in their houses : who<br>give them meat and drink for the pilfer which they prompt them<br>to take in a clandestine manner; little money is given to the<br>depredators, and what is gained by those destroyers of youth,<br>who sell the property of honest people, is spent in debauchery<br>drunkenness, and every thing which degrades human nature.<br>Bad women and sabbath breaking he considered as two evils next<br>in magnitude to the one already mentioned, the whole of which<br>he warned young and old carefully to avoid, especially those num<br>bers of young persons who are at present living by no other<br>means than housebreaking and theft.<p>Wylie belongs to Paisley, is about 17 years of age, and by trade<br>a weaver.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; His parents are respectable, and no person can blame<br>but rather feel for them, when the fault lay with the young man<br>man himself, who despised  the&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;wholesome  counsel which they<br>afforded him, and which he knew when too late.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  <p>Printed at Glasgow....Reprinted at Edinburgh for J.
