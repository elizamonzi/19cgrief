	<p> THE<p>Darlin' old Stick<p><p>My name is bold Morgan M'Carthy, from Trim,<br>My relations all dead, except one brother Jim ;<br>He's gone a sogering out to Cow-Bull,<br>I dare say he's laid low with a kick on the skull.<br>But let him be dead or let him be living,<br>A prayer for his corpse I'll be giving,<br>To send him soon home or to heaven,<br>For he left me this darlin' old,stick.<p>If that stick had a tongue it could tell you some&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;me tal<br>How it battered the countenance of the Neils ;<br>It made bits of skuls to fly about in the air<br>And it's been the promoter of fnn at each fair.<br>For I swear by the toe nails of Moses,<br>It has often broke bridges of noses ;<br>' Of the faction that dare to oppose us?<br>It's the darlin' knipeen of a stick.<p>The last time I used it 'twas on Patrick's Day,<br>Larry Fegan and I got into a shillay ;<br>Went on a space to the Fair of Athboy,<br>Where I danced and when done kissed Kate M' Evoy<br>Then her sweetheart went out for his cousin,<br>And by japers he brough in a dozen,<br>A coldrum they would have knocked us in,<br>If I had not a taste of a stick.<p>War was the word when the faction came in,<br>And to pummice us well they pulled off the skin,<br>Like a Hercules there 1 stood for attack,<br>And the first that came in I sent down on his back,<br>Then I shoved out the eye of Pat Clancy,<br>For he once humbugged sister Nancy,<br>In the meantime poor Kate took a fancy<br>To myself and my bit of a stick.<p>I smathered her sweetheart until he was black,<br>She tipped me a wink we were off in a crack,<br>We went to a house the other end of the town,<br>And we oheerd up our spirits by letting some down<br>When I got her snug into a corner,<br>The whiskey beginning to warm her,<br>She told me her sweetheart was an informer ;<br>Oh, it was then I said prayers for my stick.<p>We got whistificated to such a degree,<br>For support poor Kate had to lean against me)<br>I promised to see her safe to her abode,<br>By the 'ternal! we fell clean into the mud on the road.<br>We were rousen by the magistrate's order,<br>Before we could get a toe further?<br>Surrounded by peelers of murther,<br>Was myself and my innocent stick.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-<p>When the trial came on Kitty swore to the fact,<br>That before I set too I was decently whacked,<br>And the judge who had a little more feeling than sense<br>He said what I had done was in my own defence.<br>But one chap swore against me named, Carey,<br>Though on that night he was at Tipperray,<br>He'd swear a coal porter was a cannary,<br>To transport me and my stick.<p>"When I was acquitted I leapt from the dock,<br>And the gay fellows all around me did flock ;<br>I'd a pain in my shoulder I shook hands so often,<br>For the boys all imagined I'd see my own coffin.<br>I went and bought a gold ring, sirs,<br>And Kate to the priest did bring sirs,<br>So the next night you come I will sing, sirs,<br>The adventures of me and my stick.<p><br>LOCH KATRINE WATER.<p>The brave highland chieftains went forth heart and hand,<br>For to welcome their Queen at the head of their clan ;.<br>And the sons of St. Muago proved  loyal and true,<br>On the day that our Queen went Loch Katrine to view,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>In the month of October on the 14th day,<br>She turned on the water to Glasgow they say,<br>While all that was present so loudly did cheer,<br>For to welcome the Queen tha' we all loved so dear.<p>From city and village, from cottage and hall,<br>To welcome the Queen they went forth one and all,<br>From the lowlands and highlands they were to be seen,<br>That day at Loch Katrine to welcome their Queen.<p>The Water Commissioners to the loch did repair,<br>And the provost and magistrates likewise were there,<br>And the head engineer Mr Bateman was seen,<br>On the platform that' day for to welcome the Queen.<br>And the Volunteer Rifles from Glasgow did go,<br>For to welcome their Qaeen and their loyalty show,<br>By the rain on that day they got jolly well wet,<br>And some got a cold they will never forge,<p>When the little Rob Roy she at length hove in sight,<br>Each bosom beat high with a thrill of delight,<br>Loch Katrine that day lay calm and serene,<br>Rejoicing it bore on its bosom a Queen.<br>'Midst the cheers of the people that day she did land,<br>And God save the Queen was played up from each band,<br>While the brave Athol Highlander', cannons did roar,<br>For to give her a welcome she ne'er got before.<p>When the Glasgow old wives gets the water to drink,<br>They'l never need any more whisky I think,<br>At the public-house counters no more they will clatter,<br>For instead of the blue, they'l drink Loch Katrine water.<br>And Forbes M' Kenzie they vow and declare,<br>They'll drown in the loch, and the devil may care.<br>With the shebeen-house keepers who fortunes have made,<br>By poisoning the folk since this act was made.<p>To Glasgow it will be a blessing I'm sure,<br>The Loch Katrine water so wholesome and pure,<br>What fevers and plagues it will from us keep,<br>And we hope its promoters a blessing will reap.<br>May the Queen o'er us be long spared to reign,<br>And may good luck attend her by land and by main,<br>So let each loyal subject give a hearty huzza,<br>To the Queen for the honour she did us that day.<p>By JOHN WILSON, Ballad-Singer, to Her Majesty.</p>
