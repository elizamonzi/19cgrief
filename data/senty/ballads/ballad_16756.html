	<p> A&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;STRANGE&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;WONDERFUL&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ACCOUNT&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;an<p>INHUMAN MURDER<p>Committed in the Canongate  of EDINBURGH,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;on MONDAY,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;March&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;15th,  by<p>JAMES&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; SCOOGY<p>On&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the PERSON  of<p>COMMON&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; SENSE.<p>ALL civilized Sates, all Modes of Religion, in every Age, have pro-<br>nounced deliberate Murder as the most atrocious Crime human Na-<br>ture is capable of; a Crime of more general Importance than any other ;<br>therefore claiming a peculiar Vengeance.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In this detestable Light, the<br>Fact hereafter related must appear.<p>In Crimes of this Nature, Circumstances carry great Weight ; on which<br>Evidence alone, JAMES SCOOGY, the Perpetrator this dark Deed,<br>might jnstly be declared Guilty, as an established hatred to the Deceased<br>has appeared in all his Actions: However, the Fact is rendered incontest-<br>able, by the following extraordinary and supernatural Revelation.<p>Passing thro' the Canongate on Friday Night, betwixt the Hours of<br>Twelve and One, I was accosted near the Entrance to the Theatre by a<br>Female Figure, whom I endeavoured to avoid, supposing her to be one<br>of the Priestesses of Venus looking out for Proselytes ; but upon a near<br>Approach, by the Assisstance of the Moon, and an unusual Tremor that<br>came upon me, I perceived the Object to be no other than what in vulgar<br>Phrase is stiled a Ghost. I was struck at so new and unexpected a Sight<br>with Fear and Awe; I started and would have retired, but was prevent-<br>ed, and at the same Time, was addressed by the Shade, as follows:<p>" Mortal, fear not, thou art free from Danger; I am the Spirit of Com-<br>mon Sense come to sollicit your laterposition for Revenge upon the Assassin,<br>who last Night most cruelly put an End to my corporeal Existence."<p>Having summoned Resolucion to enquire the Particulars and promise my<br>Assistance, the unhappy Lady proceeded in the following Manner :<p>" Know, Mortal, that JAMES SCOOGY, to whom I owe my Death,<br>some Years ago sollicited Favours from me, which he could never ob-<br>tain, tho' he has always boasted of my kind Influence, in Common with<br>that of other Females, whom he never knew, or but very slightly. Hav-<br>ing always shunned, and frequently exposed him, he conceived an<br>irreconcilable Hatred to me, as is plainly manisested by all his Actions. I<br>have had many narrow Escapes from his Rage, and have been often greiv-<br>ously wounded by him ; at length the fatal Hour arrived, when I was<br>to become the Monster's Prey. Last Night, as I was returning from a<br>Visit, paid to my younger Sister Prudence, just at this Place my mortal<br>Foe rushed out upon me, dragged me forcibly into an Area, which I<br>perceived to be that of the Theatre; and here called out upon one of<br>his Vassals, who sometimes appears in the Shape of a Dragon, to open<br>his Castle Gate, and assist him to force me in. Vain were my Cries and<br>Supplications; they could not touch his murdrrous Heart; he meditated<br>not only my Destruction, but also the most excruciating Tortures. For<br>this Purpose he loaded me with Tragedy Chains, and mounting me upon<br>one of Bays's Horses, worse to me than the Brazen Bull of Phalaris,<br>ordered me to ride for his Amusement. After this he undertook to Pan-<br>tomiue in the Character of a Monkey, and obliged me to personate a Clown,<br>then viewing me with malicious Joy, Wretch, says he, I know you have<br>a natural Affection for Theatres, therefore have chose one for the Place<br>of your Death ; one, from whence, to the utmost of my Power, I have<br>banished you.-----Think on my Darling Or-------n of China;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;think of<br>the Co----s ; think of Harlequin Restored ; all sacrificed to your Malice:<br>But my Revenge is come ; thou shalt die : But I will first convince thee<br>that should I condescend to grace the Stage,, a thousand G-----cks must<br>be immediately eclipsed. Here he spouted various Passages, till the Tor-<br>ture grew almost beyond bearing. I implored some Pity in the Name of<br>Common Honesty, Common Humanity, Who are they, replied he ? I never<br>had any Acquaintance with either of them. How long he might have<br>continued my Torture I know not, had not his faithful Dragon warned<br>him of an approaching Dun. This hurried on my Fate; he snatched up a<br>Harlequin Sword and instantly dispatched me; observing that he hoped<br>by my Death to reduce public Criticism to the Standard of his Opinion:<br>But the Caitiff here is disappointed ; for I this night appeared to my elder<br>Sister, Judgment, who has promised to have a sharp and severe Eye upon<br>whatever this Enemy to our Family may produce, not withstanding that<br>pert and peremptory Dame, Fashion should chance for a short Time to be<br>of his Side."<p>Here, the Cock crowing, the Shade vanished and left me, wrapped<br>in Wonder and what I had seen and heard ! A Mode of discovery as extra-<br>ordinary as the Crime revealed, which according to promise, I thus Pro-<br>mulge, and hope the Assassin, as he is well known, may be speedily brought<br>to the Bar of Justice.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; HUMANUS.</p>
