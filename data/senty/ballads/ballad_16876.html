	<h2>Transcription</h2>
	<p> A Full and Particular Account of the Trial & Sentence<br>of JOHN COUNTERFEIT, who was sentenced to<br>be Pillored at the Cross of Edinburgh, on Wednes-<br>day, 14th March, 1821, for Willful Imposition, &c.<p>AT EDINBURGH, on Monday the 12th March, 1821, came on,<br>before the High Court of Justice and Reason, the trial of<br>JOHN COUNTERFEIT, a very noted character, accused of felon-<br>iously, wickedly, maliciously, and falsely assuming the authority,<br>dress, and character of a High Personage of the first distinction;<br>of forcibly entering the dwelling-house of an elderly respectable<br>Lady, residing in the New Town of the Metropolis of Scotland ;<br>and of demanding money and other property, in the assumed name<br>and character of the Prince and Power of the Air!<p>Candid Truth and Sterling Justice, two very respectable old<br>ladies, were then brought forward by the public prosecutor, in<br>support of the libel. The first witness, Candid Truth, was solemn-<br>ly sworn, by Lord Justice Reason, who deponed-That upon the<br>23d day of February last, the prisoner feloniously and forcibly en-<br>tered the house of Mrs---------, No. -, ------Street, New Town,<br>Edinburgh, dressed in the skin of a Buffalo, or other wild animal,<br>with large horns in his forehead, and having a long bushy tail be-<br>hind ; and threatened to take Mrs ----------into his custody imme-<br>diately, unless she would deliver her money, jewels, and other va-<br>luable property into his hands instantly : that the old lady, seeing<br>his horns, and other awful appearances, doubted not but he was<br>Auld Clooty himself, delivered immediately into the prisoner's<br>hands one  hundred pounds sterling, being all the money she had<br>at the time in her possession, and set an hour for him to return next<br>day to get the remainder of her property; but officers were in atten-<br>dance at the appointed time, and he was made prisoner on his ap-<br>pearance. All which were corroborated by Sterling Justice, the<br>other witness for the prosecution.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Lady herself identified the<br>prisoner's person, and deponed, that on his entering her bed-room,<br>she thought to herself that he was Belzebub, and was the more<br>confirmed in this opinion, by the declaration of her two servant<br>maids, Prejudice and Superstition, who respectively stated, that,<br>within their own knowledge, many such like demands were made<br>by him on genteel families of their acquaintance, which were never<br>refused, as the consequence would be dreadful indeed.<p>No exculpatory evidence being adduced, the Jury were ably ad-<br>dressed, at considerable length, by Mr Common Sense, for the crown,<br>and the learned Mr Quirk, for the prisoner, when Justice Reason<br>summed up the evidence, in his usual, impartial style. The Jury,<br>having retired for about half an hour, brought a verdict of guilty of<br>Willful Imposition and Robbery against the prisoner; and found<br>Prejudice and Superstition, the two waiting-maids, guilty, art and<br>part, of assisting him in the said imposition and robbery.<p>Lord Justice Reason then proceeded to pronounce the awful sen-<br>tence of the law upon the prisoner, and said, "John Counterfeit,<br>you have been found guilty, by a respectable jury of your country-<br>men, of two horrid crimes, willful imposition and robbery; of de-<br>manding a sum of money in the character of a personage to whom<br>money can be of no use ; endangering the life and reason of the<br>plaintiff, and disgracing the calling of a common thief; and, of<br>robbing the said plaintiff of one hundred pounds: therefore the<br>sentence of the court is-That you be confined in the Lock-up-<br>house of this city, without the light of the sun, or communication <br>of man, till Wednesday the 14th March inst. On which day, at 12<br>o'clock, noon, you are to be brought from your dreary abode, and <br>placed upon the Pillory, at the market cross of Edinburgh, for the<br>space of one hour, in the same inhuman garb in which you com-<br>mitted the unlawful crime for which you are to suffer, with a libel<br>on your breast, specifying the said crime, and accompanied by your<br>worthy associates, one on each side of you, and who will afterwards<br>be publicly rebuked in a full meeting of the Clashing Wives' Society. <br>If, however, you be what you pretended, and can, without picking<br>locks or opening doors, make your escape, you will certainly avoid<br>this disgrace, and never be guilty of the like crimes again. <p>Janet Clinker, in her weekly journal, quickly spread the news of<br>this comical trial and sentence, the day arrived, thousands of people<br>from all corners crowded to see the scene; but unfortunately, when<br>the hour came, and the cell was searched, the prisoner was no where<br>to be found. It was then alleged, that, by the assistance of a twig<br>from the same broomstick on which Meg Merrilees ascended from<br>the Earthen Mound about two years before, he made his way up<br>the lum, and thus escaped justice, to the great disappointment of<br>the numerous spectators assembled on the occasion.<p>Printed for William Cameron-PRICE ONE PENNY.</p>
