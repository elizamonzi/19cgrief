	<p> PERTH CIRCUIT.<p>PERTH, Wednesday 17th April 1833.<br>JOHN Moir was then placed at the bar, accused of<br>Wilful Fire-raising. The Counsel set up a plea of<br>insanity-which he proceeded to establish by the evi-<br>dence of Dr John Stewart, who deponed to his having<br>at various times an opportunity of examining the<br>state of the panel's mind?that he had seen him this<br>morning?that he had also seen him almost every<br>ten days during the three last years, and he is of<br>opinion that the panel is not a responsible moral agent<br>?that he never was perfectly sane, his mind during<br>the whole of witness's experience of him, being in a<br>state of imbecility?that he has known him lie in his<br>bed for ten days at a time ?never knew him read, and<br>was perfectly incapable of carrying on a connected con-<br>versation. Dr Malcolm followed, and corroborated<br>the evidence of the preceding witness.<p>Lord Moncrieff then proposed that such order should<br>be taken with the prisoner as would prevent similar<br>attempts in future. To which Lord Medwyn assented ;<br>and the panel was removed from the bar to the jail,<br>there to remain until otherwise disposed of.<p>MARY CLARK, otherwise DONALDSON, accused of<br>Theft, aggravated by being habit and repute a thief.<br>?Pleaded guilty. After a suitable admonition from<br>the Bench, sentence of seven years' transportation<br>was pronounced against her.<p>PETER COUPAR, (from Dundee) charged with<br>House-breaking and Theft, pleaded guilty. Sen-<br>tence?14 years' transportation.<p>JANET KENNEDY or MUIR (from Dundee) ac-<br>cused of Theft, with the aggravation of habit and<br>repute, pleaded guilty. Their Lordships were of<br>opinion that imprisonment in this case would be fol-<br>lowed with no improvement, therefore they felt it<br>imperative on the Court to sentence the prisoner<br>(though aged) to 7 years' transportation.<p>JANET LINEMAN or ANDERSON, (Perth) accused<br>of Theft, with the aggravation of habit and repute,<br>and previous conviction, pleaded guilty. Sentence,<br>7 years' transportation.<p>MARGARET M'KINNON or M'DONALD, charged<br>with Theft, habit and repute, pleaded guilty. Sen-<br>tenced to 7 years' transportation.<p>WILL SYMERS or SIMMERS and GEORGE BLAIR<br>WALLACE (from Dundee),?two boys charged with<br>Theft by House-breaking, aggravated by habit and<br>repute, and a previous conviction.? Both pleaded guilty.<br>It was urged by Counsel, in alleviation, for one that<br>he was only nine years of age, and for the other that he<br>was not many years older: that they had emitted a<br>confession on their being apprehended which they<br>sentenced to 7 years' transportation.<p>MARGARET STIRLING, (from Dundee) charged with<br>theft, habit and repute, with a previous conviction,<br>pleaded guilty. Sentence seven years' transportation.<br>MARY THORNTON or DAKERS, charged with theft,<br>habit and repute with previous conviction. Sentence<br>seven years' transportation.<p>WILLIAM FRAZER, Perth, charged with theft from<br>lockfast places, habit and repute, pleaded guilty to two<br>acts of theft stated in the indictment, but not to ha-<br>bit and repute, nor stealing from lockfast places. The<br>aggravation libelled being passed from, in consideration<br>of the panel's having already been four months in jail,<br>the Court restricted the sentence to imprisonment for<br>  nine months in the Perth jail, with such labour as<br>the establishment admits of.<p>After several unimportant trials for Theft, aggravat-<br>ed by habit and repute, CHARLES Ross, and GEORGE<br>KERR, or CAR  from Dundee, were placed at the bar?<br>charged with theft, aggravated by being habit and<br>repute, with a previous conviction. Ross pleaded<br>guilty?Kerr not guilty. After a variety of witnes-<br>sses were examined, Lord Moncrieff summed up the<br>evidence, when the Jury, after a few minutes' consulta-<br>tion, returned a verdict of guilty. Both panels were<br>then sentenced to 7 years' transportation.<p>WILLIAM KIRK, accused of two separate acts of<br>Theft, aggravated by habit and repute, was put to the<br>bar, and having pleaded not guilty, a number of wit-<br>nesses were examined, whose evidence all went to cri-<br>minate the panel. The Jury, after some little delibera-<br>tion, gave in an unanimous verdict of guilty. The pri-<br>soner was then sentenced to 12 months' imprisonment<br>On hearing the sentence he exclaimed, ' I'm no gawn<br>to be banished yet.'<p>ALEXANDER SUTHERLAND, from Dunfermline,<br>charged with theft by housebreaking, having entered<br>the house of Henry Arnot, and stolen therefrom several<br>articles of wearing apparel. The panel pleaded not<br>guilty. Several witnesses were examined, who gave a<br>very circumstantial account of the affair, all tending<br>to bring the crime home to the panel. The Advo-<br>cate Depute then addressed the jury in behalf of the<br>prosecution, after which Mr H. G. Bell replied in be-<br>half of the panel, in a speech of great power and elo-<br>quence. The Jury then returned a verdict, finding the<br>panel guilty ; and he was then sentenced to 7 years<br>transportation.<p>THURSDAY,  April  18.<p>The Court met this day at 9 o'clock, and<br>proceeded to the trial of JOHN STEWART, ac-<br>cused of murder :?'In so far as upon the 3d<br>day of October, 1832, the said John Stewart<br>did, within or near to the house then occupied<br>by him, situated at or near to Cally, near Dun-<br>keld, in the County of Perth, attack Christian<br>Mackintosh, otherwise Stewart, his wife, and<br>did with an axe, strike her several severe blows<br>on the head, in consequence of which injuries<br>the said Christian Mackintosh, otherwise Stew-<br>art, immediately or soon after died, and was<br>thus cruelly murdered by said John Stewart.<p>The panel, who is a decent-looking man,<br>about 60 years of age, and evincing nothing<br>in his appearance indicating cruelty or ferocity,<br>heard the indictment read without any appa-<br>rent emotion, and calmly answered ' Not guilty.'<p>Upon the Jury being empanelled, a defence<br>was read, holding that the panel was not re-<br>sponsible for the death of his wife, as at that<br>period he was under a state of mental derange-<br>ment?and that if she came by her death at<br>his hand, it was the result of disease and not<br>of design. A list of witnesses in support of<br>this defence was also given in.<p>ISABELLA STEWART, daughter of the panel,<br>was next called. Lord Medwyn made the wit-<br>ness aware that she had the privilege, from her<br>consanguinity to the panel, to decline giving<br>any evidence, but if she was disposed to give<br>she was bound to tell the whole truth.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  <p>Mr Crawford, Counsel or the panel, said she<br>Was citedi n exculpation, and therefore he could<br>not advise her to decline giving evidence.<p>Examined by the Depute-Advocate? Was<br>residing at Cally with her father last October ;<br>was at a loch near the house washing one day<br>in the beginning of that month; her sister was<br>with her ; returned about a quarter past nine<br>after being more than half an hour absent from<br>the house ; her father was not in the house when<br>they went out to wash ; met him at the door on<br>her return, and he asked ' Where the devil had<br>they been ?' He took hold of witness, drew a<br>knife from bis pocket and opened it ; did not<br>say any thing exactly at that time, nor till a<br>minute or two after ; witness did not try to go<br>into the house, but her sister did ; panel let wit-<br>ness go then, and tried to get hold of her sister,<br>took hold of witness a second time by the<br>throat, having the knife still in his hand.?<br>Witness asked what was the matter, but he did not tell<br>her. Witness thought he was angry with her for<br>going to the loch with the washing. Witness did not<br>go into the house, but ran towards the garden with<br>her sister. Her father took hold of her a third time,<br>and said he wanted to kill her. Said 'd?n you. it is<br>you I want.' Witness got free and went down to<br>Spoutwells, but not knowing at the time what had<br>happened. They then asked him again what was the<br>matter?upon which he answered that he had killed<br>their mother, and he would kill them too. This was<br>immediately before going to Spoutwells, where she<br>found her brother Daniel, who with a man named<br>John Rattray, on hearing them crying, went on to<br>Cally. Did not go back herself  till some time after.<br>Saw nobody about the house but her father when she<br>came back at first from the loch. Had left mother<br>in bed apparently well when they went to the loch.<p>Mary Stewart, youngest daughter of the panel; and<br>Daniel Stewart, his son, gave similar evidence.<p>JOHN RATTRAY, gardener, Dunkeld, knows<br>Daniel Stewart, the last witness, and his sisters ;<br>recollects of the latter coming to their brother's<br>house between 9 and 10 of the morning of 3d<br>October; went to panel's house with Daniel ;<br>saw nobody there but a woman lying dead ;<br>knew it to be the body of panel's wife; saw a<br>large cut or gash on the forehead ; left the house<br>without shutting the doors; met Dr Kilgour, and<br>returned to the house along with him ; found<br>every thing in the same state ; saw an axe in<br>the house; knew panel by sight, and spoke to<br>him occasionally, but had no intimate acquain-<br>tance of him.<p>ALEXANDER MUIR KILGOUR, surgeon Dunkeld,<br>was taken to panel's house by his son on the<br>morning of 3d October; saw the deadbody of a<br>woman in the kitchen; felt the body, very little<br>heat in it; the body must have been dead more<br>than half an hour; did not know Mrs Stewart<br>personally. [Here the doctor read a report<br>which he along with some other members<br>of the profession had made on the case.?<br>The wounds were described as very severe.] Identi-<br>fied the axe pointed out by Rattray, and thinks it the<br>instrument which had inflicted the wounds ; has oc-.<br>casionally seen the panel, and at one time attended<br>him professionally. he thinks about ten or twelve years<br>ago ; attended him then on account of iflammatory<br>symptoms ; at that time he appeared in sound mind.<p>Cross-examined?The wounds  were&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;sufficient to<br>cause instant death ; there was no appearance of any<br>struggle ; witness' attention was not called to the<br>state of panel's mind.<p>Captain C. H. Ross?Has for some-time had the<br>general charge of the woods about Dunkeld ; panel<br>was in witness's employ, in charge of that part of the<br>woods nearest Dunkeld ; he had fair wages, and was<br>perfectly capable of discharging his duty; witness<br>saw him every morning, and sometimes through the<br>day ; panel's conduct was always quite correct, but<br>there was an apparent obtuseness or dullness about<br>him, and he did not seem to comprehend witness's or-<br>ders sometimes,but they were always correctly executed.<p>Dr Ma'colm, physician in Perth, identified the re-<br>port on the state of Mrs Stewart's body, which report<br>he had subscribed along with Dr Kilgour, &c. ; the<br>death must have been almost instantaneous ; is a phy-<br>sician to Murray's Royal Asylum ; had seen the pa-<br>nel on the 4th and 5th October, again on the 1st of<br>April, and frequently since; from his own observa-<br>tions, and what he had heard in evidence to-day, he<br>conceived himself competent to give an opinion on<br>the state of his mind ; thought him perfectly sane<br>when he first saw him, anid is of the same opinion<br>still; does not hold an attempt to commit suicide an<br>infallible proof of insanity<p>John Stewart panel's eldest son?his father was<br>subject to low spirits at times. One morning n<br>1815, his  ather went out early, and not having re-<br>turned by five o'clock search was made, when he was<br>found in a seed-room covered with blood.For some time<br>he was tied and witness was not allowed to see him.<br>About a month after, he was confined sometime in<br>Dunkeld. He was frequently subject to low spirits<br>after, and the Sunday before his mother's death he<br>appeared much worse.<p>A number of other witnesses gave evidence<br>to prove that the panel had formerly attempted<br>to commit suicide,?that he was subject to<br>epiliptic fits,?and that he was insane.<p>After a patient investigation of all the cir-<br>cumstances of the case, the criminal was sen-<br>tenced to be executed on Tuesday the 14th<br>May next. His Lordship, in announcing the<br>sentence, implored him to make his peace with<br>Heaven, as he had no hope of mercy on earth.<p>The trial lasted from nine in the morning,<br>till eleven at night, and produced great excite-<br>ment in the neighbourhood, from the horrid<br>circumstances attendant on the murder.<br>Stewart was brought into Perth for the mur-<br>der, at the time that Chisholm was receiving sen-<br>tence of death last Circuit, for a similar crime, <br>for whom a plea of insanity, it will he recol-<br>rcted, was also attempted to be established.<br>No one's life would be safe were the murderers<br>allowed to escape, merely by pretending mad-<br>ness.<p></p>
