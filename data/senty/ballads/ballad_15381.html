	<p> RESURRECTION.<p>Full, True, and Particular Account of the seizure<br>of the Body of an Old  Woman, on  Saturday<br>Night, the 8th instant, at the head of Infirmary<br>Street, on its Way to Surgeon's Square ; with an<br>acconnt of that Horrid and Awful event which<br>took place at Falkirk, where a Woman was<br>carried off by three men, and supposed to be<br>Bnrked.<p>With horror we record another instance of Re-<br>surrectionists stealing Dead Bodies. This is a<br>crime for which we have the most awful detesta-<br>tion, and we cannot too strongly deprecate the<br>characters of those who live by the abominable<br>traffic of Dead Bodies.<p>Such high prices are given by Surgeons for Hu-<br>man Bodies, that the monsters who supply them<br>will run any risk in procuring them. What pain-<br>ful feelings must the relatives of the deceased have<br>when the intelligence reaches them that the body<br>of their nearest and dearest friend has been taken<br>from the grave, (and which put them, to a great<br>deal of expense,) to be cut and mangled by Sur-<br>geons, and ultimately consumed to ashes.<p>What induced that Monster, Burke, to Mur-<br>der so many human beings? Nothing but the<br>price offered to him by the Surgeons. And what<br>can induce those infernal fiends to pillage church-<br>yards ? Nothing but the price paid them by the<br>Lecturers on Anatomy ! Are the Public always<br>to be tampered with in this manner ? if they are,<br>Shame to Scotland.-The idea of this is truly hor-<br>rible.<p>Let some punishment be inflicted equal to the<br>crime, and the recurrence of it will be less fre-<br>quent,<p>On Saturday night,  about half-past Seven, two<br>men in a Gig, were eyed by some persons coming<br>along Nicolson Street.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When they observed the<br>people watching them so narrowly, they drove on<br>as quick  as  possible  till  they reached  Infirmary<br>Street, when the crowd became so great that they<br>were forced to leap from the Gig, and  made off.<br>The body of a Woman, about 50 years of age,<br>was found in the Gig, and taken  to the Police<br>Office, where it now lyes.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Horse and Gig<br>were sent to the White  Hart  Inn, Grassmarket.<br>One of the despicable wretches is supposed to be<br>Gow, a noted resurrectionist.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Police are in<br>search of them.<p>WOMAN SUPPOSED TO BE BURKED!<p>On Sunday a man applied at the Police Office<br>here for a Warrant to search the Lecture Rooms<br>for the Body of his Wife, who had not been seen<br>since Monday last. He belongs to Falkirk, and<br>it is believed the poor woman has been Burked !<p>John Campbell, Printer, Edinburgh.</p>
