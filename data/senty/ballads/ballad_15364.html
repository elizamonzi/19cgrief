	<h2>Transcription</h2>
	<p>  An account of the Last Moments  and  Exe -<br>cution of William Burke, at Edinburgh,<br>for the west Port Murders.<p>This day, Wednesday 28th Jan.<br>1829. William Bnrke underwent the <br>last sentence  of the law, for the mur-<br>der of Mrs Docherty, one of the vic-<br>tims of the West Port Tragedies.<br>At an early hour the spacious street,<br>where the scaffold was erected, was<br>crowded to excess, and all the win-<br>dows which could command a view,<br>were previously bespoke, and high<br>high prices given for them.<p>Burke was aged 33 years, was<br>born in the parish of Orrey county of<br>Tyronne. He received good educa-<br>tion for one of his rank, he was ori-<br>ginally brought up a weaver in Stra-<br>ban, but tiring of that employment<br>he became a baker. He atterwards<br>enlisted in the Donegal Militia, in<br>which he served five years; during<br>most of that time he was servant to<br>one of the officers, and acquitted him-<br>self so well, that he gained the ap-<br>probation and respect of allwho knew<br>him. He married during that time<br>a woman in Bellinha, county of<br>Mayo, by whom he had two children,<br>who are dead, but his wife still sur-<br>vives in Ireland. When his regiment<br>was disbanded, he deserted his wife,<br>and children, and came to Scotland,<br>and picked up from the streets of<br>Glasgow the woman McDougal, with<br>whom he has since co-habited ; she<br>was a common prostitute, although<br>her husband at that time was alive.<br>He engaged as a labourer on the<br>Union Canal, and has resided in<br>Edinburgh about 11 years, but has<br>been occasionally absent.<p>Burke was one of the most singu-<br>lar criminals ever consigned to the<br>scaffold.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  He was considerably su-<br>perior in education to his own class<br>of his countrymen, and was just pos-<br>sessed of so much knowledge as should<br>make the harrowing recollections of<br>a series of murders drive him to the<br>borders of dispair.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He was a man of<br>remarkably firm nerve, and although<br>only a few days divided him and a<br>painful death, he strived to be per-<br>fectly&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;calm; he even laughed, and<br>attempted to talk over the  murder<br>of his victims with as much garrulity<br>and&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;indifference&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;as&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;shopkeeper<br>would over his losses in trade, or the<br>good bargains he has made, but yet<br>he candidly confessed that he felt the<br>full horrors of his  situation; he was<br>always caught weeping bitterly, and<br>inyoluntary but heavy sighs escaped<br>him in conversation.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He paid  par-<br>ticular attention to  the instructions<br>of his priests, and was dilligent in his<br>preparation for the  awful change he<br>has since undergone.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He was very<br>communicative, and freely made con-<br>fession of his former guilt ; while ex-<br>amined&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; by the&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Solicitor&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;for&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the<br>mother&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Daft.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Jamie,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;pro-<br>cure evidence against  Hare,  he  de-<br>clared that he  harboured  no vindic-<br>tive feeling against him, and that 'as<br>a dying man, he would tell the truth.'<br>Burke complained much of the cold<br>he experienced in his cell, which ag-<br>gravated the complaint under which<br>he laboured.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  One gentleman who<br>had visited him, remarked that this<br>was a cold place, "Yes" he said, "it<br>is; but  since&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;matters have come to<br>this  pass, I must just bear it."&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The<br>indulgence he experienced in his diet,<br>was according  to  the  direction  of<br>this physician, who had ordered it on<br>account of his health. The nearer<br>his end approached, his mind seemed<br>to acquire firmness, and he <p>expressed himself prepared to meet<br>the scaffold with as much calmness <br>as if he were going to his bed.<p>Burke was brought from the Cal.<br>ton Hill Jail betwixt Tuesday night<br>and Wednesday morning. At the<br>moment the Coach arrived at the en-<br>trance to the Lock-up, by the front<br>of the County Hall, the unhappy man<br>might have heard the busy clacking<br>of the hammer of the men employed<br>in putting up the  scaffold where he<br>was shortly to make his final exit.<br>It was wisely considered by the au-<br>thorities that the prisoner and the<br>assistants at the execution should he<br>so prepared before leaving the Lock-<br>up, that no useless time should be<br>spent on the drop,-accordingly, af-<br>ter spending the morning in prayer,<br>and going through the ceremonies<br>used by the Roman Catholic Church.<br>A few minutes after 8, the procession<br>moved up by Libberton Wynd, at<br>the head whereof was the scaffold.<br>He was constantly attended by the<br>Priest ; when he appeared on the<br>scaffold, a strange sensation passed<br>through the crowd, which was im-<br>mense. After casting his eyes once<br>round, he dropped his head, and lis-<br>tened deeply to his spiritual adviser.<br>As usual a psalm was sung, and pray-<br>ers put up for the unhappy man, he<br>was quite weakly and emaciated, and<br>was supported to the drop; after the<br>executioner adjusted the rope, he al-<br>most instantly gave the signal, and<br>was launched into eternity.<p>As yet, we have got no certain ac-<br>count of the many murders this man<br>was accessary to, but they are gener-<br>ally believed to be about 30. On the<br>2d of January, at his own request, he<br>sent for the proper authorities, to<br>whom he gave a full and free confes-<br>sion of all the particulars connected<br>with the horrid affair; -he said that<br>he had done so, that he might have the<br>short remaining days of his life spent<br>undisturbed by inquisitive intruders ;<br>and requested that as few as possible<br>would get admission to see him. A<br>few days before his death, it was<br>read over to him, to which he still<br>adhered. This confession, we under-<br>stand, will be shortly published.<p>Hare's wife was set at liberty yes-<br>terday, and in crossing the Bridges,<br>was recognised by some person who<br>had seen her in jail.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A crowd soon<br>gathered round her, and pelted her<br>with snow balls and other missiles;<br>and had not the police  promptly in-<br>terfered in her behalf, the ungovern-<br>able rabble that beset her would have<br>quickly  executed&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;summary justice,<br>both on herself and the sickly infant<br>she bore in her arms.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; An idea pre-<br>vailed in the West Port, that she had<br>taken refuge in  her  old den, and a<br>multitude of disorderly  people con-<br>gregated thereto, to root her out  of<br>it, but quietly dispersed when assured<br> she was not in the  neighbourhood.<br> We  understand  that&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;she&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;left&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the<br>  Police Office in the twilight, to wan-<br>der whither it is not easy  to gueess,<br>but it is to be hoped, that the popu-<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;lace will not allow a  commendable<br>detestation of crime to lead to acts<br> of outrage, which the law must punish<br> with the same rigour in her case as in<br>that of any  of other child&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of sin  and<br> misery that breathes under its pro-<br>tection.<p>The Court of Justiclary was occu-<br> pied during Monday, on Hare's case;<br>next Monday it will be resumed.</p>
