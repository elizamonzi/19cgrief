	<h2>Transcription</h2>
	<p> An Interesting Account of the Trial and Sentence of<br>MARY M'KINNON, who is to be Executed at<br>Edinburgh, on Wednesday the 16th of April next<br>for the Murder of William Hewat, by Stabbing him<br>in the Breast with a Table Knife, and her Body<br>given for Public Dissection.<p>YESTERDAY, Friday 14th March 1823, came on, before the<br>Court, the trial of MARY  M'KINNON, lately residing on<br>the South Bridge, accused of the crime of Murder ; by having, on<br>the evening of the 8th day of February, assaulted and stabbed in<br>the breast or side, with a table knife, William Howat, then clerk<br>with Thomas Johnstone, writer in Edinburgh, of which wound he<br>languished in the Infirmary until the 20th day of the same month,<br>when he died. the pannel pleaded Not Guilty.<p>No objection to the relevancy of The indictment having been<br>made, a Jury were impanneled, when written defences were given<br>in on the part of the prisoner....pleading Not Guilty. That she<br>kept a licensed tavern on the South Bridge. That she had left her<br>house on the 8th February, on a visit to her neighbour; during her<br>absenee a riot took place. That the deceased, along with,others, in<br>a state of intoxication, came into her house, broke the furniture,<br>violently assaulted the females who lived in her house, she herself<br>being absent; and when she returned, was herself knocked down ;<br>and if the deceased sustained any injury at her hand, she did not<br>know of it.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <p>George Tait, Esq. Sheriff-substitute, proved the declarations<br>emitted by the pannel, as also the declaration of William Howat,<br>taken in the Infirmary on the 10th of February, in a low state, but<br>perfectly recollected. The prisoner at the Lar being shown to the<br>deceased, was identified by him as the person referred to in his de-<br>claration, which evidence was corroborated by the Procurator Fiscal.<p>Henry Ker, land-survey or, was then examined, who described<br>the whole circumstances of the case at great length, and was fol-<br>lowed by several other witnesses, when the pannels declarations<br>were read, in which she denied all concern in the murder of Howat,<br>and throwing the whole blame of it on his own party. After the<br>examination of four or fille witnesses in exculpation, the Solicitor-<br>General addressed the Jury for the Crown, and was replied to by<br>Mr Jeffrey for the pannel, when the Lord Justice Clerk charged the<br>Jury, in a luminous and comprehensive speech.<p>The Jury were enclosed about three qurters of an hour.<p>The Jury, by their Chancellor, Robert Cockburn, Esq. returned<br>a verdict, finding by a plurality of voices, the said Mary M'Kinnon<br>gnilty of the crime of Murder. The Chancellor then stated, that<br>he had been requested, by a majority of the Jury, to tender a re-<br>commendation of mercy for the prisoner.<p>The Lord Justice Clerk then stated, that the verdict of the plu-<br>rality of the Jury was in unison with the opinion of the Court. He<br>discharged them from their long and arduous duty, but  stated, that<br>he could not discover any grounds in the circumstances of the case,<br>for a recommendation to mercy?which recommendation would,<br>however, be transmitted to the proper quarter.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <p>Lord Pitmilly stated tbat the duty incumbent on the Court was<br>clearly pointed out?the last punishment of the law had been allot-<br>ed for the crime of Murder?and it is now the duty of the Court.<br>to pronoune that sentence upon the unhappy woman at the bar.<br>He agreed with the Lord Justice Clerk, in stating that he could not<br>discover any circumstances which could warrant a recommendation<br>to mercy.<p>The Lord Justice Clerk, in a most feeling and heartrending man-<br>ner, implored the prisoner to prepare for death and eternity. She<br>was then ordered be executed at Edinburgh, on Wednesday the 16th<br>April, between ihe hours of 8 and 10, and her body to be given<br>to the Professor of Anatomy for dissection.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  <p>The pannel behaved throughout the trial with great propriety.<br>She seemed very confident of she result being favourable, but to-<br>wards the end of the examination of the witnesses, her spirits<br>seemed to flag, and she became extremely agitated, She varied<br>colour while the Lord Justice Clerk was summing up the evidence.<br>During the absence of the Jury, the conflict in the mind of the un-<br>happy sufferer was very evident; and, on their return, while the<br>verdict was recording, she fainted, and continued in that state for a<br>few minutes, on recovering, she exclaimed, " O, Lord, have mercy<br>on me." The unfortunate woman had to be assisted to sit upright<br>while their Lordships were delivering their opinions.<br>Edinburgh:- Printed for James. M'Lean-price One penny.</p>
