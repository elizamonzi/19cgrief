	<p> EXECUTION.<p>A Full and Particular Account of the Execution of<br>THOMAS BLACK, who was Executed at the Head<br>of Libbertoo Wynd, Edinburgh, this morning, Wed-<br>nesday the 10th December, 1823, for Housebreaking<br>and Theft; and of his Behaviour since his Condem-<br>nation, and at the Place of Execution.<p>THIS unhappy young man was Tried at Edinburgh, before the<br>High Court of Justiciary, on the 4th of November, 1823,<br>along with another boy, John Reid, who has since been respited,<br>for Breaking iuto the House at Summerfield, parish of South Leith,<br>occupied by Mr Alexander White, Merchant, upon the morning of<br>25th July last, and stealing therefrom a great quantity of Silver<br>Plate, Wearing Apparel, &c. aggravated by being habit and repute<br>a Thief. After a full aud fair investigation, this unfortunate lad,<br>and his neighbour, were, by an unanimous verdict of a respectable<br>Jury, both found Guilty, in terms of the libel, but on account of<br>youth strongly recommended to mercy.<p>During the trial the unfortunate Thomas Black was perfectly<br>composed, and maintained a careless indifference about his awful<br>situation; but, soon after his condemnation, he evinced a most<br>becoming sense of his melancholy situation, as well as the greatest<br>contrition for his dissolute habits of life. So much so, that a few<br>weeks before his execution, he requested to be indulged with a se-<br>parate cell, as the society of his companions in misery led to con-<br>versations on their former way of life, which served to interrupt<br>his more serious reflections, and to divert his mind from those im-<br>portant considerations which his awful situation was so powerfully<br>calculated to excite. A respite for his fellow-sufferer, as stated<br>above, was got fourteen days before, and it can be no impeachment<br>of the generosity of the heart of Black, or of the sincerity of his<br>repentance, to find that this act of mercy to another, awakened in<br>him all that love of life which had seemingly been extinguished for<br>ever. He sunk into a state of the most heartless despondency for<br>some time, and could neither think of the present nor of the future,<br>without the most agonizing feelings. Indeed, during two days he<br>scarcely tasted any food. His mind, however, was latterly restored<br>to its wonted tranquillity, and he expressed himself with calmness<br>and resignation on the subject of his approaching fate, an event to<br>which he had then looked forward as inevitable.<p>Accordingly, he was early removed to the Lock-up-House, where<br>he was waited on by several of his nearest relations, and the sepa-<br>ration from some of them was most appaling to the most hardened<br>feelings. The Clergy of the city, as well as the Chaplain of the<br>Jail, and other good Christians in town, were most attentive and<br>most earnest for his religious instruction and edification, which he<br>himself repeatedly and sincerely acknowledged.<p>He slept little or none on Tuesday evening, and the Clergyman<br>and officiating Magistrates waited on him in the Hall of the Lock- <br>up-house, a little before Eight o'Clock on Wednesday morning,<br>when he joined most fervently in the devotional supplications put<br>up on that occasion. After which his arms were pinioned, and the<br>melancholy procession soon moved up, in a slow and solemn man-<br>ner, to the head of Libberton Wynd, attended by a strong detach-<br>ment of Police Officers. He appeared on the scaffold, decently<br>dressed, about half past eight o'clock, where a psalm was sung, in<br>which he joined, and a most impressive prayer put up for him to<br>the throne of mercy, by one of the Clergymen present; during<br>which he appeared most devout and attentive to what was so elo-<br>quently urged in his behalf. Having taken a solemn farewell of<br>those around him, he mounted the fatal drop, assisted by the Exe-<br>cutioner, where he appeared most fervent in prayer, while the rope<br>was adjusting round the beam. All things being prepared, and the<br>Executioner taking farewell of him, he shortly dropt the signal,<br>and was instantly launched into the world of spirits, a little before<br>nine o'clock.<p>We sincerely trust that the premature and shameful end of this<br>young man, who was only about seventeen years of age, be a warn-<br>ing to all who saw him, or heard of his awful fate.<p>Edinburgh, Printed for R. Forrest, Price One Penny.</p>
