	<h2>Transcription</h2>
	<p> The last Speech And Dying Words of John Webster Gardiner at Greenhill ; who was Execute at<br>Greentide, near Broughtoun, for the Horrid Murder of Marjory Campbell a Girl.<p>THAT Supreme and Soveragin Judge of Heaven and Earth, whose Prerogative Royal it<br>is to Search the Heart and Try the Reins of the Children of the Sons of Men, has brought me<br>here this Day to be cut oft by the Sword of Justice, as an Infectious Member from<br>the Body of Humane Society, as a just Demerit of the unpresidented Barbarity  that I<br>have been guilty of, in taking away the Life of a poor Innocent Girl, who never had done  me<br>the least Offence in the World; it would be'expected that I would give some Account of my<br>bypast  Life and Conversation.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But alas! it's but a very Melancholly one I can give, and  alse<br>little Reason can I give of the unparalelled Cruelty I have committed.<p>I was born in the Paroch of Dron, in Perth Shire, of Honest, tho' poor Parents, my Father<br>dying while I was three Years of Age, was left to the Care of my Tender Mother, who was<br>not wanting to put me to Schools tor my Education, till I was nine Years of Age, at which<br>Time it pleased GOD to Remove my Mother likewise, then I was taken Care of by her Friends,<br>till I attained to the Knowledge of Reading and Writing, and instructed by them to be a Gar-<br>diner, whereby I might have gained my Livliehood sufficiently, and had good Examples by<br>them, but alas slighted all, and at that Time had some small Regard to Religion, and the Wor-<br>ship of GOD, till attained to the Age of 18 ; at which Time I began my Uncleanness, and<br>begat a Child, for which I Deserted my Mothers Friends, the good Example they shewed me.<br>And came to a private Gentlemans Service in Fife, and staid there for some Time, till I was<br>obliged to Return and Satisfie the Church for my Scandal ; and thereafter I came over to<br>the Lothians, and settled with one John Smith Gardner at Grange, where I staid for some Years,<br>where I had a good Example shown me, during which Time I fell deeply in Fancy to the now<br>Misfortanate Helen Newlands, my present Wife, who seemed not to accept of my Affection,<br>upon which I used Foolish Measures, not worth mentioning; by which at last to her Misfor-<br>tune, she condescended, intirely to prevent my then vowed fore-end, since which Time she has<br>continued a Dutiful and Loving Wife, and has Born me one Child, and is Bigg with another.<br>Ah! that me should have such a Wretch to her Husband, or they to their Father: But allow-<br>ed my self loose Reins, adicted my self to Drinking, and intirely neglected Christian Duty,<br>and leaving the Grange, I engaged at Greenhill near Edinburgh, by whole Relation with Mrs.<br>Clegborn in the Society, I came to be acquaint in her Family, where the Harmless Girl staid.<p>My Wife staying in Town, and as I had Occasion to see her, I called at Mrs. Clegborns, and<br>would frequently have given the Child Aples, Peats, or such Fruit, as I at any Time had in my<br>Pocket, in which Time the Devil entered into my Heart, and had Unclean Thoughts towards<br>Her, and would have shewed fondness to the Child, she not understanding my Hellish&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Inclina-<br>tion, gave me Occasion to Contract the Thoughts of this Cruel and Unheard of Barbarity  I<br>have committed, which was upon the 14. Instant.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Having  come to Town to see my Wife;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and in my Return to Greenhill, went to Mrs. Cleghorns, where I staid till it was late :&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I de-<br>sired a young Boy ( who staid in the Family ) and her to Convey me to the Port,to which they<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  were Averse, but judging me Drunk, as truly I was, were willing to see me out at the Port.<p>O  Cruel, Return, Thrice, Cruel Return, for such Innocent Kindness, and they having come<br>at length ; I prevailed upon them to come the length of Mrs. Herriots, where thy both would<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Return ; but further prevailed with them, to see me four or Five Rig Broad in upon the Crosts,<br>and then in a violent Manner, gript her by the Neck, saying, Maysie Campbell ; say, GOD have<br>Mercy upon upon, for I am going to Kill you. To which, she replyed, Why, John ? Kill me,<br>in which Time I pulled out a Knife I had in my Pocket of Design, and therewith Cut the<br>Throat of the poor Victime, as if it had been the Throat of a Sheep or a Calf. O inhumane<br>Wretch that I was, for taking away the Life of a poor young Creature, who had never given<br>me the least shew of Offence. I justly suffer this Day a shameful, but a deserved Death, as the<br>Demerit of my Wickedness. I freely Forgive all that ever did me Offence, as I Desire to be<br>Forgiven of GOD. I beg the Forgiveness of all my Spectators ; and especially of that Gentle-<br>man, whose Child I have unworthily murdered, and all his Relations : O ! the Evil of Sin ?<br>What can be expected; when all Fear of GOD is cast of, his Worship Forsaken,and the Service<br>of the Devil engaged into ; as alas ! I have done. I have been a lewd Liver, a Horrid Sinner,<br>and Guilty of all Imaginable Sins ; but not I hope, of that Unpardonable Sin, I need not Name<br>them to the World.<p>I am now going in the 25 Year of my Age  but alas ! too many being so badely spent; I<br>am near now to the End of my Journey. But my Work is great, and I Fear almost to begin.<br>My present Case then is, To be lying in the Dust before the LORD, acknowledging the Hai-<br>nousness of my Crime; and crying bitterly to GOD for Mercy, in and throw the Blood of<br>JESUS CHRIST. And begs earnestly, that the World, and all you Spectators, take Warning<br>and Example of me. And especially, you of the younger Sort,To Remember your  Creator in the Days of<br>your Youth. For it you cast off GOD and his Precepts, it's hard to know what the Event may<br>be. I declare as I am a dying Man,I never was Guilty of Murder before,tho' some Years agoe,<p>I out of my Folly, declared I had.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And therefore, GOD has now justly let me fall in to it.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I<br>leave my poor Wife and Child to the Mercy and Goodnesss of GOD.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I wish the LORD may<br>make up her Loss,and give her a Heart to Forgive me, for my undutiful Behaviour towards her,<br>especially in this. O all Degrees of People.that sees me suffer this just and deserved Death; Bless <br>GOD that he has not let you fall,and be not lifted up,but be humble  and beg of GOD that ye<br>be not given up to the Temptations of the Devil, and these powerful Corruptions that dwell in<br>the Heart of the Children of the Son of Men by Nature? O for free Grace & Rich Mercy, now<br>in my last Extremity.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now I'm going to Dropt into the World of Spirits, and has nothing to<p>look too, but to the Riches of the Mercies of GOD, throw JESUS CHRIST. Into whom I<br>commit the Stress or my Salvation. Into thy Hands, O LORD, I Recommend my Spirit. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;John Wehster.</p>
