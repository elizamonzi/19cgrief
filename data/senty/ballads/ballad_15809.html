<br>Beneath the Shelter of the Maiden Fort,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>Writing in Capitals  upon thy Stern,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>Here stands &cetera, that all may learn,<br>The Cargo is return'd by his deep Skill,<br>And that thou art a standing Merchant still,<br>Around thy awfull Throne, the Coasters croud,<br>Where thon in querpo stands by thousands View'd<br>Whilst a Dutch Vessel for the Indies Bound,<br>Carrying 700 Tun is run a Ground, <br>Her Main-mast bruisd, and floating in the Sea <br>But thou brave Man supports that usefull Tree<br>Within thy Iron Barge, thou stands Erect,<br>safe with the Sauldiery around the Deck,<br>Pelted with Hand Granads thou'rt firm as Steel,<br>And doth not hide thy self within the Keel.<br>The Western Wind that regularly Blows,<br>Knows the Sea Tides, and how she ebbs and flows<br>Made the with success on his Billows Ride,<br>Tho' some alledge ye'r now at a Neep Tide,<br>As if that Eolus stood at thy beck&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
