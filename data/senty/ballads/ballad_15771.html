	<p> The last Speech and Dying Words of<br>James  Thomson Tincklar.<p>Who was Executed for the Murder of Hellen Currie, upon the 2d of Aprile, in the Year<br>1719. At Adincraw, in the Shire of  Berwick<p>I AM brought here this Day to Suffer, for the horrid and and Unnatural Murder of<br>my fellow Creature: And being now to step into Eternity. I think fit to ac-<br>quaint my Spectators  of my Life and Conversation I was Born in Fisheraw, of<br>Honest Parents, but was left Young, so that having none to look after me. I first en-<br>gaged ( and woes me for it) with one John Bell a Tincklar, who learned me to Pike<br>and Steal: and so I remained with him for Eighteen Years, and he also learned me<br>all manner of Debauchery, which is the Cause I Suffer this Day. when I left him,<br>and Married a Wife called Katharine Home, who was one of the same gang, about<br>two Months after I was maried, I met on the Road a Farmer coming from a Fair in<br>the South, my Wife advised me to fall upon him and Rob him, for she said  knew<br>that he had Money upon him, so I fell upon him and broke his Right Arm, and two<br>Ribs of his Side, and took from him Eleven Guineas, my Wife would have had me to<br>Murder him, but he crying out for Mercy I could not do it.<p>Another Day, as I was coming by a Door my Wife having a Dog, which was left<br>her by her Father, did bite off the Ball of a Man's Leg : And I being Angry at her<br> for keeping such a Dog, and would have Killed him. She told me that she had other<br>Service for him. I not thinking on this unhappy Day  the same Dog acted the thing<br>that new I  justly suffer for. My Wife and I being upon the Road, betwixt Dunce and<br>Dunbar, where I had the Misfortune to meet this young Woman, who told me she<br>was going to see her Friends. My Wicked Wife having the Devil in her Heart,<br>stirred me up to take the Cloaths off her, or else she would never Bed with me. Af-<br>ter I had stripped her Naked till the Shirt, she caused me to take her to a Glen side a<br>little way off, and there being a Tree at the Glen side, my Wife caused me ty her to a<br>Tree, and hont the Dog at her, who teared the Paps from her, and the Intrels of her<br>Belly; then my Wife and me fled to an Ale-House, about two Miles off, and two<br>Gentlemen coming by and seeing that dreadful Sight, but the Woman was Dead before<br>they came. But the Gentlemen riding after the Dog who came into that same House<br>where I was sitting. And being set down they called for a Drink of Ale, and a Piece<br>of Bread, and he gave a piece of it to the  Dog, and said he would give three Guineas<br>for that Dog. I over hearing; their Discourse steped forward to him, and told them<br>that the Dog was mine, and he should have him at the same Price, who immediatly de-<br>sired me to sit down with him and take a Drink, and I not suspecting that the Gentle-<br>men knew any thing about the horid Murder ; but immediatly they sent for a Party<br>and secured me, and I was carried to Prison by order of a Justice of Peace, I acknow-<br>ledge the Sentance of the Judges to be just I ackgowledge I have been a great Sin-<br>ner from my Youth, a Curser, and Swearer, and Sabbath-breaker, and given to all<br>manner of Vice, so I desire you all my Specatators to take Example by me, and not run<br>on in a course of Sin, as I have done: And you Young Men to take notice whom you<br>Marrie, for my Wife has been  the occasion that I suffer here this Day. Then turning<br>his Face to the Ladder he Prayed very earnestly in these Words.<p>O GOD I am shortly to appear before Thee, to render an Account of all my ma-<br>nifold sins and Transgressaions, and of this horrid Murder that I am guilty&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of ;<br>but O LORD, there is Mercy with Thee for the greatest of sinners.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I repent<br>heartily from the bottom of my Heart for all the sins I have committed, and particular-<br>by of this sin of Murder.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And before he was casten over he said, O LORD into thy<br>Hands I recommend my Spirit.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amen.</p>
