	<p> THE&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; LAST&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<p>SPEECH<p>AND<p>CONFESSION<p>OF<br>PATRICK&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;M'NICOL, alias CAMPBELL,<p>Who  was executed at Mugdock, upon the 28th of March 1718.<br>for the Murder of John Graham.<p>The foresaid Patrick M'Nicol being brought out of Prison, guarded<br>by a Company of Foot Soldiers, and a Troop of Dragoons, being<br>about Half Way to the Place of Execution, halted, and had a long Dis-<br>course to the Ministers in the Highland Tongue ; being come to the<br>Place of Execution, he read the 55th Chapter of Isaiah, and the 51st<br>Psalm.<p>And after Prayer, being asked by the Ministers there present, viz.<br>Mr. John Anderson Minister in Drymen, Mr. Livingston of Strathblain,<br>Mr. Robert M'Farland of Buchanan, Mr. Livingston beginning, said,<br>Patrick, You are now within an Hour or thereabout, by all Probability,<br>to appear before the great Judge of Heaven and Earth, to receive your<br>Sentence either of Bless or Curse : For be that consesseth bis Sins and for-<br>saketh them shall find Mercy ; and therefore I would have you give all the<br>Satisfaction you can to the Spectators, now when you are on the Brink<br>of Eternity, and with that you would not go down to the Grave<br>with a Lie in your right Hand. For more Satisfaction answer me these<br>Questions.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<p>Whether or not, was you in a Combination with the rest of the Priso-<br>ners to make your Escape ? He answered, Yes. Whether or not was<br>you designed to murder any in Case of Opposition ? He answered, No.<br>Then he asked, Whether or not did you strike at the deceas'd John Gra-<br>ham ? He answered, No. Then he asked, If he had any Weapon in<br>his Hand ? To which he answered, No; And as he should shortly an-<br>swer before GOD, he was free of his Death.<p>Then Mr. M'Farland prayed very fervently for him, that the LORD<br>would assist, and help him to bear up under that sharp Trial he was to<br>undergo. Then he went up some Steps of the Ladder, and sat down,<br>and prayed very earnestly in the Highland Tongue : He admoni-<br>shed all young Men to keep good Company, and to keep holy the<br>LORD's Day, which he, now to his great Gries, had too often profaned ;<br>and to beware of Swearing, and taking GOD's holy Name in Vain ; For<br>the LORD will not bold them guiltless that taketh His Name in Vain. He<br>desired all good Christians there present, to put up their. Petitions to<br>GOD on his Behalf, as long as they saw Life in him.<p>He forgave all them that had wronged him, particularly the Judge & Jury.<br>He forbade the Ministers to pray for him as a Murderer ; he gave great<br>Satisfaction to all Beholders, of his Well-being. When he went up the<br>Ladder, he defired the Executioner not to put him off, until he gave him a<br>Sign, which accordingly he did, and so was cast over with these Words in<br>his Mouth, LORD JESVS, receive my Spirit.<p>And when he was cut down, there were Eight of his Relations that put<br>his Corps in a Coffin, and carried him away in a Litter to his Father's<br>Burial-place.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
