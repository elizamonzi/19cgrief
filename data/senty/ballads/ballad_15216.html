	<p> Trial & Sentence<p>OF<p>JAMES BELL, Private in the Fifth Dragoon Guards, for the<br>Murder of Serjeant-major Moorhead, by shooting him with a<br>pistol, at Piershill Barrachs, on Sunday the 17th May last.<p>Monday, June 22d,  1835.<p>JAMES BELL, private of the Fifth Dragoon Guards, was<br>then put to the bar, charged with the Murder of serjeant-major<br>William Moorhead of said regiment: In so far as, upon the 17th<br>day of May last, at Piershill Barracks, be, did wickedly and feloni-<br>ously " fire off and discharge, at and against his person, a pistol or<br>other fire-arms, loaded with gunpowder, and with a leaden bullet,<br>or some other hard substance to the Prosecutor unknown, and did<br>thereby wound him severely in or near his back, in consequence of<br>which he was mortally wounded in his person, and died on or about<br>the 25th day of May 1335."<p>The prisoner's counsel gave in written defences, denying gene-<br>rally the charges set forth in the indictment, and pleading that he<br>was insane at the time libelled.<p>George Tait, Sheriff-Substitute identified the declaration made<br>by the prisoner on Monday the 18th, and deponed, that he ap-<br>peared then perfectly sane and collected, and emitted freely and<br>voluntarily, that he was also at his second deckration of the<br>27th?-In which he was fully corroborated by, Archibald Scott,<br>Procurator Fiscal, and R. J. Moxey, the Sheriff Clerk.<p>Private George Smith was at morning parade with the prisoner,<br>and heard him apply to Serjeant Bracken for leave of absense, who<br>reported it to Serjeant Major Moorhead, who said that no man<br>would get leave of absence from the stables that day, when Bell<br>muttered some answer which he did not hear. Saw Bell after-<br>wards speaking to Captain King for leave, in which he did not suc-<br>ceed, and saw him also at the stables at 12 and 3 o'clock, and again<br>at roll call at 7. About ¼ past 7 he saw him coming to the stables,<br>No. 18, where Serjeant Moorhead was standing inside with his <br>back towards the door, and when at about 3 yards distance, saw<br>him present and fire the pistol, when Moorhead fell upon his right<br>knee, crying " O God, O God, O God." Identifies the pistol mark-<br>ed E 9 to be that which was in charge of the prisoner.<p>Private John Calinan was in No. 13 at evening stables, where<br>Moorhead with his back towards the door, heard the report of a<br>pistol from behind, and turned instantly round, when he saw Bell<br>walking away from the stable door, with the pistol in his hand ;<br>went after him, and he, Corporal Baxter, and Patrick Egan seized<br>him, took the pistol from him, and conveyed him to the guard-<br>house,?the prisoner exclaiming, " Ladies and Gentlemen,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;look<br>here, I have shot the tyrant who tyranized over the troop and me<br>too."<p>Corporal Martin Baxter, and Private Patrick Egan corroborated<br>the foregoing statement of Calinans<p>Private William Graham saw the prisoner with  a  pistol  in his<br>hand near the outside of the stable door, as  he was going f r a<br>bucket of water, who asked where Moorhead was when he told him<br>he was within.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Had not gone  2 or 3 paces. when he heard the re-<br>port of a pistol, and turning, saw Bell seized by Baxter a few steps<br>from the door, whtn he said, "You're down, you b------r.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If I did<br>not do good for myself, I have done it for my comrades."<p>Adjutant Henry Ash was in the mess-room, when it was report-<br>ed that a shot had been fired, and by Major Scarlett's orders sent<br>off his servant for a surgeon.  He went to the black hole and or-<br>dered the prisoner to be searched and handcuffed, when he heard<br>him say, " I hope I have done it effectually, have I comrades."<p>Dr Galbraith Logan attended the deceased from the day of re-<br>ceiving the wound till his death, and along with Sir George Bal-<br>lingal opened the body, when they found that the ball had lodged<br>in the spinal marrow, which no doubt had caused  his death.<p>Sir George Ballingall corroborated this statement.<p>A number of exculpatory witnesses were called, endeavouring to<br>establish Moorhead's severity in duty, and the prisoner labouring<br>occasionally, or at the time under a fit of mental derangement.<p>The Jury were addressed by the Solicitor-General for the Crown<br>and by the Advocate for the pannel, bath at considerable length ;<br>after which the Lord Justice Clerk went over the evidence with his<br>usual ability, when the Jury returned a verdict of Guilty.<p>The pannel was then sentenced to be executed on Monday the<br>13th of July next, at the usual place of execution.<p>Sanderson, Printer, High Street, Edinburgh<p></p>
