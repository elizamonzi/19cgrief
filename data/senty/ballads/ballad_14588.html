	<p> Supposed Murder.<p><p>Account of that Horrid and Barbarous Murder, which a Baker<br>supposed he had committed on the body of his Wife in Glas.<br>gow, on Tuesday last, the 13th March, 1827, and for which<br>he  has undergone a public investigation*<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  It happened lately that a certain baker in the city?whether ocnstitutionaily irrit-<br>able, or only temporarily so, owing to the present provoking cheapness of the " staff<br>of life," we cannot tell,  but so is the fact, as  we hare heard-on receiving some<br>slight provocation from his wife, determined to knead the soft dough of her breasts<br>and sides, so as to make her better bred in all time coming.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dire were the blows-<br>deep were the groans which  were heard over-night by the neighbours?and the<br>death-like silence which ensued, made some of them surmise that probably the va-<br>lorous baker had. rather OVERDONE the thing, and that an Assize would have to be<br>held upon his work of that night.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They, therefore, quietly took measures to ascer-<br>tain the true state of matters?and, peeping through the back window, they happily<br>discovered the baker snoring in the arms of Morpheus, and his unfortunate help-<br>rate, with a brace of black eyes, busily preparing the breakfast of the barbarian,<br>A wag amongst them, observing that things were  not so bad as was seared, deter.<br>mined on a practical joke, which should have the effect, at least, of frightening the<br>baker when he awoke, and, perhaps, of making him curb his wicked and danger-<br>us passions in future-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Accordingly he procured a black STRAIGHTING BOARD, and<br>gently lifting the window, introduced it into the room, and left the grim coneom-<br>itant of death in such a situation, as to be full in view of the baker when he should<br>open his eyes!&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; By and by, the drowsy god winged his flight, and, favouring the<br>joke, gave the baker no intimation of the Well-meant trick which was proposed for<br>him.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But rich was the treat, exquisite the enjoyment, when the waiting eyes of the<br>lurking spectators without beheld the  man of ftour suddenly start up, rub his eyes.<br>and in a frantic manner jump out of bed, exclaiming?" My Mary !?my Mary !!-<br>have I murdered my Mary !!!"?-Mary, who was in the kitchen, and  had not been<br>in the bed-room since the introduction of the straighting-board, was, in her turn,<br>equally alarmed for the wits of her savage lord, as he was for UER life, and rushed<br>pale and trembling, in her white night-gown, into his presence, and there stood like<br> very GHOsT !&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To end the tale, the baker, with some difficulty, was convinced that<br>the apparition before him was the real CORPORATION, and not the SPIRIT of his mur-<br>dered wife.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She, with the usual gentleness of her sex, freely forgave him, upon<br>his  promising to be a good boy for the future?and we hope they have since been,<br>and will continue to be, happy.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Be this as it may, however, a report of murdor<br>against the baker spread thro' the city for two days, but we are happy to announce<br>that the particulars here detailed, form " the head and front of his offending?-no<br>more"?Copied from the Free Press of l7th March, 1827.<p>SINGULAR OCCURRECNCE.?A very hovel, but outrageously indecent occurrence<br>took place on Thursday in the streets of Calton. A destitute young man, an Irish-<br>man, died there on  Monday, and an uncle offered the use of his parlour for the<br>reception of the company who-should attend on his funeral obsequies. A coffin<br>was provided, and 12s. 6d. collected to defray expenses ; but when the people met,<br>the uncle was drunk, and would not permit the body to be removed. Some present.<br>thought it incumbent on them to insist upon the corpse being delivered up, and ac-<br>tordingly took it by force. The infuriated uncle raised a great disturbance, and<br>followed the procession, pelting them with stones. Those who carried the coffin<br>were worst off, and were obliged to run. This gave fresh courage to the barbarous<br>pursuer, who .chased them through several ssreets, swearing and crying in a most<br>appalling manner. The crowd raised on the occasion was immense. At length.<br>Sergent Leckie appeared, who took the fellow into custody, and the body was  put<br>into the grave, without further interruption The object of the wretch appeared<br>from the answer which he gave the officer to a question which he put to him on the<br>way to the office, if he intended to sell the body to the Anatomists? When he re-<br>plied, "' Have I, not a right to make as  much of it as I can ?" He was  ordered <br>to pay a severe fine, on pain of being sent  to Bridewell.<p></p>
