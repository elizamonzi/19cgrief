When Father and Mother forsakes, then the Lord will take me up,  Psal. 27, 10.<br>he relieveth the Fatherless and Widow, Psab&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;146, 9. A Father of the Fatherless and<br>a Judge of the Widow is GOD, in holy Habitation, if any great Person that is both able and<br>willing to do yon good and promiseth, you'l readily trust, think then&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;with whom you<br>have to do that has promised, he is not far from every one of you ; for in Him you Live,<br>and Move, and from Him you have your Being, be ashamed then to distrust, Faithfull<br>is He that has Promised, who also will do it, O be much in abaseing your selves, and hum-<br>bly beg for the Spirit of Grace and of Supplication, he has promised, and he will bring<br>all things to your Remembrance, and teli you all that ever you did in your Life, with-<br>out me ye can do nothing ( faith our Saviour) and by whom ye shall be able to do all<br>things, ye can have nothing but by Christ Jesus, therefore studdy to love GOD who so<br>much loved the World, as to give his only Begotten Son, how shall he not with him give<br>you all things, he bids let not your Heart be Trubled nor affraid.
