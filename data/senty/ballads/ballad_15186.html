Wilson lost a great deal of blood, and was in a<br>very dangerous state. The knife fortunately struck on the fifth rib,<br>and glanced upwards upon the forth else, it must instantly have<br>have proved fatal.<p>The jury returned a viva voice verdict, finding M'Kay guilty of<br>the assault and stabbing, and M'Donald guilty of assulting and strik-<br>ing as libelled, and M'Kay was sentenced to be publicly whipped<br>on a platform to beerected at the common place of executions, between<br>the hours of twelve and two, on Wednesday the 27th July current,<br>previous to transportation beyond seas for seven years, and M'Donald<br>to be confined in Bridwell for twelve months, and during that period<br>to be kept at hard labour.<p>Edinburgh: Printed for Wilham Robertson...
