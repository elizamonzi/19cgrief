	<p> An Account of the Trial and Sentence of D. M'INNES, Master, and<br>P. M'BRIDE, pilot,of the Comet steam-Boat before the High Court<br>of Admiralty, on Wednesday the 2lst December 1825.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  <p>W EDNESDAY, December 21st, 1825, the Judge Admiaal Sin <br>John Connell, sat in the chamber of the Second Division  <br>of the Court of Session, for the trial of Duncan M'Innes,  late mas-<br>ter, and Peter M' Bride, late pilot, of the Comet steam boat, accused<br>of culpable homicide, and also of culpable, negligent, and reckless <br>command, charge, and steering of a steam boat, &c.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The criminal <br>letters set forth that-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <p>"The said Duncan M'Innes, and Peter M'Bride, having proceeded<br>from Inverness in the said steam boat, called the Comet, with  the<br>intention of proceeding to Glasgow, and they having the direction,<br>guidance, and command of the said steam boat, the said Duncan<br>M'Innes being master thereof, and the said Peter M'Bride being pi-<br>lot, of the same: and having, late on the night of Thursday the<br>20th, or early on the morning of Friday the 21st of October, 1825,<br>arrived in the said steam-boat in the river or firth of Clyde, and at<br>a part thereof nearly opposite Kempock Point, in the shire of Ren-<br>frew ; and it being their particular duty to take care that the said<br>steam-boat should not come in collision with any other boat or ves-<br>sel, they did, nevertheless, both and each of them, or one or other<br>of them, culpably, and reckless of the consequences, and by their<br>extreme and culpable carelessness and inatention, and misconduct<br>in managing and directing the course of the said Comet steam-boat,<br>bring the said steam-boat in collision with the steam-boat called the<br>Ayr, whereby the said steam-boat was immediately sunk, and<br>whereby a great many persons, men, women, and children, to the<br>number of 62 or thereby, were drowned, and bereaved of life, and<br>were thus culpably killed by the said Duncan M'Innes and Peter<br>M' Bride," &c.<p>The criminal letters also charged them with having " culpably,<br>and reckless of the consequences, neglected to cause a light to be<br>affixed to the said steam-boat, and continuing to steer and direct<br>the said Comet steam-boat, without any such lights," &c. The<br>criminal letters were then read, and the parties called upon to plead,<br>when they both pleaded Not Guilty.<p>Defences were then put in for the pannels, in which they denies<br>the relevancy of the libel. They addmitted the loss of the Comet,<br>but not that it was caused by culpability or negligence on their<br>part. They might have erred in judgement, but they did not<br>admit that they had done so. In a case like that of the Comet and<br>Ayr, they said, the safety of the vessels did not depend upon the<br>attention of one of them in particular, but upon both; and if the<br>Ayr had taken its proper course, no collision could have taken place;<br>and if the master of that vessel had afterwards rendered what as-<br>sistance was in his power, the whole or most of those who were<br>lost, might have been saved.<p>Two objections were then stated on the part of the pannels, to<br>the relevancy of the indictment, but which were not sustained by<br>the Court, and an interlocutor, confining the charge to culpable<br>homicide, was then recorded.<p>A great number of witnesses were then examined for the prose-<br>cution, among whom were Thomas M'Clelland, master, Robert<br>Knox, pilot, and John M'Gregor, seaman, of the Ayr steam-boat, the<br>vessel that came in collision with the Comet, when that unfortunate<br>boat sunk. All of whose evidence tended to attach a good deal of<br>culpability to the conduct of Mr M'Innes, the master of the Comet,<br>in not having a light out at the time of the accident, nor a good<br>look-out a head, &c.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  <p>The pannels' declarations were then read, in which M'Innes<br>stated, that he was master of a steam boat on the Clyde for may<br>years, and detailed the progress of the voyage of the Comet from<br>Inverness till she met the Ayr- He stated that there was a scarcity<br>of candles on board the Comet at that time, which was the cause<br>there were no lights hung out, and he considered therc was no<br>danger after they passed the Cloch, which they did before he left<br>the deck that morning. M'Bride's was nearly similar.<p>After which, several respectable witnesses were examined in ex-<br>culpation, ono of whom the Judge complimented in strong terms.<br>The Jury were then addressed by the Lord Advocate for the<br>crown, and by Mr Cockburn for the pannels, when the Judge<br>Admiral summed up the evidence at great length, reprobating in<br>strong language the conduct of the Ayr, and urging the necessity of<br>an example being made, to prevent a recurrence of similar accidents<br>by carelessnes. After which the Jury were inclosed, and ordered<br>to return their verdict on Thursday at Two o'clock.<p>Accordingly M'Innes was found Guilty by the Jury, on Thurs-<br>day, and M'Bride Not Guilty; when the former was sentenced to<br>three months' imprisonment in Greenock Jail, and the latter dis-<br>missed from the bar, after a suitable admonition.<p>Edinburgh: Printed for Wm.
