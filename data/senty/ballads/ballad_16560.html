	<p> E X E C U T I O N,<p>A particular Account of the Behaviour and Execution of WILLIAM  LEONARD SWAN,<br>at Glasgow, on Wednesday the 16th May, -1821, for ultering two Forged Five Found<br>Notes of the Paisley Banking Company, in. the month of November last.<p>GLASGOW, MAY 16, l821.<p>WILLLIAM LEONARD SWAN was Ex.<br> ceuted this day. pursuant to his sentence,<br>convicted of issuing a forged note for L.5, on<br>the 8th November last, in the house of Agnes<br>Mitchell, change-'keeper in Airdrie, purporting<br>to be of the Paisley Banking Company, and of<br>passing another of the same amount in the<br>house of John Smellie, change-keeper, Clark-<br>ston.<p>Swan was brought up to the profession of the<br>law, and for some time was clerk to M'Kechnie<br>and Mann, writers in Glasgow, but in March,<br>1815 , was tried before the High Court of Jus-<br>ticiary, for theft, fraud and forgery, accused of<br>having abstracted from the letter box of his<br>employers, a letter directed to " Mr. Alexan-<br>ander Mann, Glasgow," containing a bill of ex-<br>change for L. 100, snd with forging,or causing<br>to be forged Mr. Mann's indorsation.<p>Having procured a school-boy, of the name<br>of Glassford, by promising him money, to pre-<br>sent the bill to be .discounted at the office of<br>the Bank of Scotland, in Glasgow, he was ap-<br>prehended, owing to the bill being stopt at the<br>bank, and the boy told it .was Swan and another<br>person that gave him the bill, and they were<br>Both seized and committed to prison. They<br>both, however, were dismissed from the bar,<br>the Lord Justice Clerk observing to Swan,<br>that he might rest assured, if he ever again<br>appeared at the bar, accused of any similar con-<br>duct, the strong suspicion under which.-he now<br>day, would not-be forgotten, but should infallia-<br>biy rise up in judgment against him, and a very<br>different verdict would await him." One-would<br>have thought that this narrow escape should<br>have been a lesson to a person of his informa-<br>tion, this, however, has not been the cast", and<br>all now saw the melancholy result of his mis-<br>conduct.<p>He afterwards took up his residence in the<br>village of Airdrie, where his parents  at present<br>reside, where be acted in  the capacity of a<br>messengers, but having tallen into some pecu-<br>liar embarrassments. a caption was issued a-<br>gainst him and he fled to Paisley, where he <br>was apprehended for the crime for which he <p>suffured. On his trial he solemntly declared his<br>innocence of the crime of which he was found<br>guilty, and denied to the last all knowledge of<br>the notes being forged.<p>He was in hopes of a mitigation of his pun-<br>ishment till Sunday last, when an answer to his<br>petition from the Secretary of State was receiv-<br>ed, which stated, that owing to the recent ex-<br>ample which had been made at .Stirling, he<br>could not consistently recommend him to mer-<br> cy. On the same day he attended sermon in<br>the Chapel, along; with the rest of the prison.<br>ers, when an excellent discourse was delivered<br>from Zecariah ix chap, and 12th verse, " Turn<br>ye to the strong hold, ye prisoners of hope,"<br>and seemed to be deeply affected.<p>He was assisted in his spiritual concerns by<br>the  Rev. Principal Taylor, and several .other<br>ministers, whom he thanked for their attention.<br>He has devoted part of his time to writing a<br>serious Address to his fellow prisoners, which<br>we under stand is to be published in the form<br>of a cheap tract.<p>Swan was a fine looking man, about 35 years<br>of age, and has left a wife and four children,<br>and  his -last farewell .with them on Tuesday<br>evening, was truly affecting.<p>At two o'clock the Magistrates entered the<br>Court Hall, and the prisoner soon after, gen-<br>teelly dressed in black, with weepers on his<br>coat Dr. Taylor, the Rev.Mr.Marshall, <br>and several other Gentalman assisted him in <br>his devotions, ;which being fershed, about 3<br>o'clock he ascended-the scaffold  and immedi-<br>ately thereafter dropt a handkerchief as a sig<br>nal when the drop tell, and he was separted  <br>from this world for ever the crowed was not<br>very great.<p>It is much to be lamented that the many ex<br>amples which have been made have not in the<br>least tended to put a stop to this unpardonable<br>crime the conmission of which struk at the<br>very life and soul of a commercial country like <br>this.<p>Printed by John Muir.<p><p>.<p></p>
