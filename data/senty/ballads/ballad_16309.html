	<p> THE&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;LAST<p>SPEECH,<p>Confession and dying words of JAMES DORMAND, who<br>was execute at Perth, on Friday the 31st of May 1793.<br>for Four crimes of Highway Robbery.<p>JAMES DORMAND, was a native of, and born in the north of Ireland, only<br> aged 19 years, of honest and respectable parents, who, gave him an education<br>suitable to their situation, and to his capacity, but to Which, it appears, he paid little<br>attention; he was brought up to the manufacturing line; but being of a roving and wild<br>disposition, could not settle at his business, and neglecting his work for days, and even<br>sometimes for a whole week together, caused his masters to make heavy complaints to<br>his parents and cautioners, but of all the remonstrances that could be used with him was<br>of no affect, on the contray, it rather hardened him in his wicked and vicious courses.<br>He at last left his business and absconded altogether, taking with him money, and some<br>other articles, part of which he stole from his father and mother, &c He then went to<br>Dublin, and fell in to the chapman way, but he had not been long there when his mas-<br>ter advertised him; having notice of which, he shipped for Scotland, and along with<br>him one Robert Rogers, who was convicted of the same crime, and is now lying in jail,<br>under his Majesty's, respite for three weeks. They then came to Glasgow selling their<br>goods, travelling through the country, until they came to Dundee; and having both<br>engaged themselves to one of the menufacturing houses in that place, continued now<br>and then at their work until such time as this last robbery which they committed was<br>found out.<p>When Rogers and Dormand left Dublin, they landed at Saltcoats, and coming on<br>the road betwixt Irvine and that place, they fell in with a young women, whom, it is<br>confidently said, they murdered and robbed her of a bundal, which she was carrying;<br>whether this be absolutely truth or not we cannot positively say, at any rate the woman<br>was murdered on that road about two years ago, and her body dragged into the inside of<br>a hedge. She was seen walking on the road in company with a soldier some time be-<br>fore, but he wanting a refreshment, went into a public house, and insisted very much on<br>her to go in with him, but she positively declined. The man having refreshed himself<br>pursued his journey, and having gone a good way, he met as he still supposes, this Dor-<br>mand and Rogers, with the young women's, bundal in one of their hands, which he<br>knew some way off, but took no thought how or what way it came into their possession,-<br>and still continuing his march, he saw some blood on the road which he traced to the<br>inside of the hedge, where he found the murdered body lying, upon which, the soldier<br>immediately concluded, that these two men he had seen before with her bundle, were<br>the actors of this horird deed.<p>Such is the report that has gone abroad, if it be true, it is hoped that Dormand will<br>confess it with sincere and contrite repentance before he is launched into endless eternity,<p>Dormand confesses that he has been guilty of many enormous crimes, and of being much<br>addicted to drink and bad company, both of which he could not refrain ; he said. For<br>him to enter into a particular detail of the many crimes he has been guilty of, would only<br>tO the public.<p>He confessed with four roberries in and about Dundee, with several other petty crimes,<br>particularly that for which he was sentenced; and regrets the taking the watch from the<br>farmer, which, with 2 l. I OS. was all they robbed him of. Their acquaintances offered the<br>farmer forty pounds sterling, if he. would declare at their trial that the watch was not his.<p>This unfortunate young man has appeared very penitent for this some time past, and<br>expressed a great deal of thankfulness that he had got so long a time to think seriously of<br>his evil ways, and prepare for another world; he said he was much obliged to the inhabi-<br>tants, the clergy, and the jailors, for the great knidness they had shown to him since he<br>was under sentence of death ; and expressed his thankfulness to those gentlemen who had<br>interceeded for his Majesty's clemency towards him ; and hoped, that as his (brother in ini-<br>guity) Rogers, had got a rspite for a short time, he would obtain a free pardon ; and beg-<br>ged of him to keep always in mind how narrow an escape he has made, and shun the ap-<br>pearance of all evil, and learn to do well; and exhorted him not to forget his fatal excite,<br>and that, without a sincere repentance, their always awaited a punishment, either sooner<br>or latter, for those that does evil. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  JAMES DORMAND<p></p>
