	<p> KEAN'S<p>Contradiction of all that has been advanced<br>he left the City of Glasgow, wrote'<br>one of the hulks.<p>Copy of a letter received by a Law<br>is, in a few instances, corrected ;-?<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1825<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; '&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  <p>"Dear Mr. M------,<p>" I received yours on the [  ]d, and it gave me very much surprise to<br>learn by its contents that there is so much falsehood. slander, and wilful imposition<br>thrown out against me from the first, and is likely to be until the last. You wish<br>me to write a confession that I made to two Gentlemen, which is a thing utterly<br>out of my power to do, as I never made confession of any kind to either of them ,<br>nor was it in my power to do so, unless I was to resort to the same means  that they<br>are doing with me now. You also boldly say. that I need not deny it, for I will not<br>be believed. That is what I cannot help, whether I am believed or not; but, for<br>the respect I always held for truth and justice, and likewise for your satisfaction, I<br>never made any such assignment or confession ; and any such you have seen, them<br>I say now are all false and without  foundation, as it never was in my power to do,<br>if I stood to truth and justice, which, with the help of God, I will always do, let<br>the world say as they will. And with respect to writing to Mr Hume, or any of<br>the Members of Parliament, I am willing either to write or meet them on any<br>ground, to substantiate the same. Common sense and reason might show to you,<br>that although I had made as many confessions as would fill one quire of paper, it<br>would do me no good with regard to my sentence, which I was well aware of my-<br>self; besides, it was not in my power either to hurt the trade, or any of those indi-<br>viduals you have mentioned, as they neither had knowledgd,  nor were art or part<br>with me in what the two Gentlemen accuse them with. And I likewise told my<br>brother-in-law, in Edinburgh, that one of the Gentlemen was with me several times<br>before I left Glasgow, wishing me to make a declaration of all I knew about my<br>unfortunate catastrophe ; but I told him he had used the basest of means to get me<br>convicted, and was it in my power to do as he wished, I would not give him any<br>such satisfaction, as he used all sorts of false means against me before my trial.?<br>He likewise went over a number of names to me, and wished to know by me if they<br>were the eight persons, as he said he had information against above 12 persons ;<br>but I told him that I doubted his information was like some of the villains brought<br>against  me, that would swear any thing the case required for him. He likewise<br>brought Mr. H----------- up one day before I left Glasgow, upon the same intent;<br>and Mr. H. told me he might be the means of mitigating my time if I would bring<br>to conviction the persons that were along with me, and who  paid me for shooting<br>at the Nobs ; but he went away much displeased when his queries had not the de-<br>sired effect. All the different questions, the names of different persons that he put<br>to me, from first to last, is too numerous for me to mention to you at this time;<br>but allow me to say, as an honest man, for the regard I have for my own soul, and<br>justice to all those innocent individuals, that whatever assignments, confessions,<br>or declarations you have seen, or may see, of the same nature, is utterly false, and<br>without foundation.<p>I am very sorry that such falsehoods should militate so far against the welfare of<br>my wife, as well as injuring the interests of society (whose basis is founded on the<br>legalist foundation in the kingdom), and all the rest of those innocent persons whom<br>they wish to hurt, by all accounts. As for myself, they may say what they please,<br>for they have done nothing else from the first to the last; but they have a just God<br>to answer to for all their unjust doings to me. Dear Mr M------------I would wish <br>you would write to me as soon as you see fit, as I am not sure of the day the ship<br>will come to take us away; and, as my money is very scarce, I hope you will pay,<br>the postage. Direct to John Kean, convict on board his Majesty' s ship, Justicia<br>hulk, Woolwich. No more from yours,<p>" JOHN KEAN."<p>The above is copied from the Glasgow Free Press of Saturday, July 2d, 1825.<p>W. Carse, Printer.</p>
