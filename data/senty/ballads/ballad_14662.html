	<p> A TRUE AND PARTICULAR ACCOUNT OF THE BLOODY AND  <p>CRUEL&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;MURDER<p>Of ELLEN  HANLY, on the River Shannon,<p>A beautiful Young Lady, of 16 years of age, who was seduced from her home in the<br>County of Limerick, by a Gentleman, who afterwards bribed his servant, Stephen<br>Sullivan, to murder her, for which they were both Executed; the whole account as<br>confessed by Sullivan at the place of execution.<p>MISS HANLY, who was a very accomplished girl, eloped from her uncle's house,<br>along with Mr Scanlan, on the 29th of June 1819, taking along whith her L.100<br>in notes, and 12 guineas in gold, and he never heard of her till she was found dead on<br>the beach, in a shocking condition.<p>Sullivan was tried at the last Limerick Assizes, and found guilty. When he as-<br>cended the scaffold, he was exhorted by the Rev. Mr, Enright to discover the truth,<br>when he declared as follows:--&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <p>" I declare before the Almighty God, that I am guilty of the Murder, but that it<br>was Mr. Scanlan who put me up to it; it was after he came from Dublin I saw him; I<br>heard he went off with a girl and I went to sec him, when he and I took a walk on the<br>strand, when he said he should like to get rid of the girl; he was at me some days be-<br>fore I unfortunately consented; he then bought a boat for the express purpose of de-<br>stroying her, and got an iron chain and ring made by a smith in Kilrush, to tie round<br>her neck. Several persons came with us in the boat from Kilrush to Carrig-island, where<br>we stopped all night. Mr. Scanlan and I went to Ballylang-ford, and bought some spi-<br>rits; and that day it was intended to murder her between Carrigh-island and Money-<br>point. Mr. Scanlan went out of the boat, in order that while he was absent I should<br>have it done; but when I looked in her innocent face my heart shuddered, and I did<br>not know how I could do it! When Mr. Scanlan returned he gave me many sour looks,<br>and was mad with me because I did not murder her; I then went out of the boat, and<br>bought 2s. worth of bread, a pound of butter, and about three half pints of Whisky, and<br>we staid out all that night till next morning; we then continued that day together.?-<br>When Mr. Scanlan got up to go out of the boat, Mrs. Scanlan asked him where he was<br>going?He answered that he was going to Glin, by a short cut, to prepare a lodging<br>for her, where they might sleep that night; he then made me take some spirits, and de-<br>sired that I should get more from her if necessary. Scanlan settled the rope, and splic-<br>ed a loop to it, which he put round a large stone, in order that I should lose no time,<br>and left every thing ready for me in the boat. In the course of the evening I mur-<br>dered her in the following manuer:?when the boat was about the centre of the river,<br>he stood up, and took a musket in his hand, with which he made a blow at her head,<br>but having missed, struck her on the arm, which was broken; he then beat her with the<br>gun till she was quite dead, and afterwards tied her right leg to her neck, to which a<br>large stone was attached, and flung the body into the river, which sunk immediately.?<br>The following day I went to Glin, where I saw Mr. Scanlan, who asked me, ' did  I<br>do that?' I told him ' I did,' ' All is right,' said he."<p>He was asked what was Scanlan's motive for having her murdered; he said he did<br>not know, unless it was that " she always called him her husband."<p>Sullivan was a good-looking man about 32 years of age.<br>scanlan, his master, was convicted and hanged at the Limerick Spring Assizes of 1819,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Printed by John Muir, Glasgow.</p>
