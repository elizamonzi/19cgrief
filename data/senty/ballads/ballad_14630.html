	<p> TRIAL<br>OF THE&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;REV.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;MR TAIT,<p>MINISTER of the COLLEGE CHURCH.<p>Just Published, an Account of the Trial of the Rev.<br>MR TAIT, Minister of the College Church, before<br>the Presbytery of Edinburgh, which met this day<br>in  the Trustee's Hall, head of Scott's Close.<p>FURTHER MANIFESTATIONS OF THE SPIRIT.<p>AS THE recent procedings as the Meetings of Presbytery, it<br>might have been supposed that the religious extravagances which<br>have of late been too frequently exhibited in  the College Church,<br>would have ceased.  But so far from this being the case,  they were<br>yesterday repeated With all their usual fervour, and in a strain of<br>fanatical excitement, as inconsistent with d[?] smay, as with the spirit<br>of true piety. Surely no  one could have possibly believed, that in<br>an age which boasts of being peculiarly enlightened, men of educa-<br>tion and character should be so far influenced by the power of de-<br>lusion, as to imagine that by uttering frantic outcries, and com-<br>mitting other extravagancies in a place of worship, they should give<br>any other manifestation than of their own folly.<p>It is lamentable to see so respectable men acting on<br>such misguided fancies; and under the vain idea of an<br>imaginary inspiration chusing a place of worship for the<br>scene of their fanatical excesses.  Immediate steps should<br>be taken to put an end to these absurd and [?]ing<br>exhibitions, by which all sober persons are deeply scan- <br>dalized. We understand that, both yesterday and the<br>Sunday preceding, in  the interval between the forenoon<br>and afternoon services, during a Prayer Meeting, Mr<br>Carlyle, Advocate, screamed and uttered incoherent sen-<br>tences in a state of great excitement. Several women<br>who were present, were so alarmed that they ran out of<br>the church, and one or two fainted when they came to<br>the street,<p>TRIAL  OF  THE REV.  Mr  TAlT.<p>This day, 31st  July? The Presbytery met  in the Trustee's Hall,<br>at 12 o'clock, The meeting Was constituted by prayer, and the<br>chair  taken by the Rev. David Thourburn of South Leith, in ab-<br>sence of the Moderator, After the ordinary rotine of business was<br>gone through, a minute was read, signifying  that the report  of  the<br>Committee (Drs Inglis and Gordon), had been shewn to  Mr Tait,<br>the contents  of which approved of, excepting that clause which says<br> that Mr Carlyle  had spoke during, his (Mr Tait's) discourse, for<br>successive Sabbaths ; admitting, at the same time, the. Mr Carlyle<br>had spoke to strengthen him in behalf of  his flock.<p>Dr. Lee proposed that as Mr Tait was in an adjoining room, he<br>should be called in by the Moderator, intimation given him<br>that the business regarding him was going to commence. The<br>Rev. Mr Tait then made his appearance, when he was informed<br>by the Moderator that several questions would require to be put<br>to him. Dr lnglis praposed that as, a report was prevalent that re-<br>newed disturbances had taken place  in the College Church, an en-<br>quiry should be invested in a Committee. Dr Lee made a motion,<br>that as  the Rev. Gentleman was present, questions should be put to<br>him as to the truth of these assertions. This, was agreed on, and<br>Mr Tait gave answers that did not satisfy the motion.<p>A discussion then took place, in which Drs  Inglis, Brunton, Lee,<br>Brown, M'Knight, Gordon,and Mr Simpson joined. It was finally<br>agreed on, that ths Presbytery should meet on friday at 12 o' clock,<br>to consider upon serving Mr  TAIT with a liblel and suspension.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<p>A. M'MILLAN, PRINTER, LAWNMARKET, EDINBURGH.</p>
