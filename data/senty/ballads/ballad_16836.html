	<h2>Transcription</h2>
	<p> An Account of the Life and<br>Transactions of Mr Richard-<br>son, late Minister at Largs,<br>how he committed Suicide,<br>by cutting his own throat.<p>IT is with regret that we announce to the public, and more so to<br>those who knew the above-described person. He was a young man<br>lately placed as Minister of the parish of Largs, well beloved by all<br>his hearers and all who knew him, promising in appearance, and<br>benevolent in all his ways. We do not wish to comment on such<br>a subject Farther than we have proper grounds, being of such a del-<br>icate nature,  which we suppose prevented the Editors of the differ-<br>ent newspapers from commenting much upon it. We can only state<br>the caue, which is reported in this place; he being but lately mar-<br>ried, and before which period had formed a contract with another <br> young woman in terms of marriage to her also; but the latter find-<br>ing that she was slighted, as is commonly the case with many of<br>her sex in the same way, consequently took it very much to heart,<br>and finding she was pregnant by him, sent the following letter :<p>" False Lover,-It was more than I would have expected from<br>your hand, and more so from the calling you profess ; a wolf in<br>sheep's clothing indeed. God and your own conscience knows your<br>false vows and protestations to me, which will yet be required at<br>your hand, where self-denial will not clear the guilty. You may<br>shudder at the thought, were you to take a proper view of the situa-<br>tion in which you stand. But, alas, too late I am justly blameable<br>of myself to forfeit my reputation, for from that moment I also for-<br>feited all claim of respect to depend upon your false gratitude. But<br>still I must remind you my character is not all, yours is also at the<br>stake. The loss of a friend may be overcome, but the loss of a cha-<br>racter still remains a stain, by which man or woman may become<br>universally shunned, universally slighted. But perhaps you have a<br>ready remedy to use with policy, and so to guard all outward ap-<br>pearance, and never to want this negative testimony on your side,<br>that the world knows no evil of you. But rest assured they will<br>not be covered with a cloak of darkness neither here nor hereaf-<br>ter. Be not deceived, though perhaps from the inward workings<br>and dreams, with the impression strong on your brain, you may<br>think yourself a chosen vessel, sanctified within, and sealed up un-<br>to the perfect day. But an unjust seal will not stand when the<br>coat of arms upon it is a counterfeit, and a guilty conscience is a<br>strong evidence against itself. Had you but taken a view of my<br>parentage down to my own character, you would neither found spot<br>nor blemish, but as pure as this paper on which I discharge my<br>mind to you. Industrious as your own were, you have to thank<br>mine for a part of that education and the rank of a gentleman that<br>you now hold, in which office you are placed a teacher of the flock,<br>which I fear is not in a safe fold to be committed to such a shep-<br>herd ; and you have found out the art by a proper management of<br>light and shade to compound these vices together, so as to give<br>body and strength to the whole, whilst no one but a dicerning ar-<br>tist is able to discover the labours that join in finishing the pic-<br>ture ; and, indeed, like many other bad originals in the world, it<br>stands in need of all the disguise it has, for who could, be ena-<br>moured of a character made up of so loathsome a compound. Could<br>you behold it naked in its crooked and deformed shape, with all<br>its natural and detested infirmities laid open to public view, then<br>you might loath at your own false heart and deluding tongue. So I<br>conclude by leaving you to your own meditations. "<p>Such is an outline of the letter which the above Mr Richardson<br>received the evening in which he committed the horrid deed upon<br>the 12th of October last, which ever since has led to discord with<br>both parties of friends connected with the family. She produced<br>letters from his own hand, in consequence of what she had stated,<br>and one of which was sent to her only about a week before his<br>marriage to the other young lady, still declaring his constancy to<br>the latter.-There is nothing we can state to have been the cause<br>of this unhappy man's revenge of himself, by putting an end to his<br>existence, only what we have already said ; and in this case we see<br>that all mankind is fallible. He was much beloved in his ministe-<br>rial office, both for great talent and sound dcctrine, and by ap-<br>pearance attentive to his duty in every respect. But there is no-<br>thing in which the mind of man is more divided than in the ac-<br>count of his horrid nature; for when we consider man so fashioned<br>by his Maker's will, so full of the tenderest dispositions of heart,<br>yet it soon deviseth evil of itself, of which it is hard to account.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  Printed for James Thomson.<p></p>
