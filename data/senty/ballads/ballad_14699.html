	<p> EXECUTION.<p>A full and particular account of the Execution and behaviour of<br>JOHN M'KANA,alias M'KENA,and JOSEPH RICHARDSON,<br>for the crime of uttering as genuine false and forged notes, who were<br>EXECUTED at Dumfries, on Wednesday the 14th day of May, 1823.<p>The above persons, as also William Richardson, brother to the said Joseph, were all three tried at<br>Dumfries, and condemned to death on Wednesday the 9th day of April last, by the Right Honourable Lord<br>Meadowbank; but since which, on Thursday the 1st instant, the Magistrates received a letter from the Right<br>Honourable Robert Peel, Secretary of State for the Home Department, stating  that his Majesty had been<br>graciously pleased to grant a reprieve in favour of William Richardson, the eldest of the two unfortunate<br>brothers, commuting his punishment to banishment for life. The intelligence was communicated to him by<br>the Provost, (in presence of the different Ministers of the town), and he received the glad tidings with becom-<br>ing thankfulness, and expressed his gratitude to those individuals who had so earnestly and successfully inter-<br>ested themselves in his behalf.<p>His brother Joseph continued to the last to be deeply affected by the awful fate that awaited him, and dili-<br>gently attended to the instructions of those Rev. Gentlemen who daily visited him. It is also consolatory to<br>learn, that the conduct of M'Kana, the Irishman, was in every respect most exemplary for his situation, tho'<br>professing the Roman Catholic creed. He was far from being bigoted; but on the contrary, was most anxious<br>to receive the advice and assistance of the Clergymen of every denomination, all of whom express themselves<br>much satisfied with the state of his mind, and the resignation which he manifested. He was by no means ig-<br>norant of religious matters, indeed, his general knowledge, makes it the more to be lamented, that he had not<br>applied his talents to some honest purpose. During the trial, which was long and tedious, it appeared that<br>M'Kana, and Hannah Black, his wife, had 72, and Joseph Richardson 163 forged notes, knowingly in their<br>possession, without lawful excuse, at their dwelling places, Lockerby-muir and Gilmourbank. The Richard-<br>sons appear to be about from 35 to 40 years of age, and M'Kana about 50. While his Lordship was pas-<br>sing  sentence, the pannel Joseph Richardson, fainted. During their long confinement, every indulgence has<br>been granted them, as far as the nature of their unfortunate situation would admit; and the prayers of the dif-<br>ferent congregations has not been omitted in their behalf; and these unfortunate men have conducted them-<br>selves both before and since their trial with becoming propriety.<p>A new drop has been erected for the occasion, and so rare it is for two to be executed here at same time,<br>that it has but once occurred for more than sixty years, and that was  the two brothers M.R------, for house-<br>breaking, in 180-, and it is to be hoped it will be much longer before such an occurrence takes place again,<br>as moral and religions instruction is by no means wanting in this part of the country, when listened to.-<br>There were an immense crowd assembled to witness their melancholy exit; the number cannot be estimated at<br>less than 10,000. From the Post-Office to the New Bridge was one dense and unbroken mass; every win-<br>dow and lamp-post was literally crowded. About a quarter before three, they asccended the fatal steps.<p>After the prisoners had been seated, a very impressive prayer was delivered by Dr Scott, to which they<br>seemed to listen with apparent resignation and reverence. After some preliminary circumstances were got<br>over, linen caps were then drawn over their features, by which they were wholly concealed; and after the rope<br>was adjusted, a solemn silence prevailed. The fatal signals were given, and in a few moments all was over! <br>Their straggles were short. After their bodies were cut down, and incoffined, they were delivered to their<br>friends for interment.<p>To prevent such crimes and such rigid punishment as is by law awarded to offenders, let such a full example<br>as is intended be the means of preventing and deterring others from entailing misery and disgrace on them-<br>selves and posterity.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  <p>L. M' LACHLAN,  PRINTER,  DUMFRIES.</p>
