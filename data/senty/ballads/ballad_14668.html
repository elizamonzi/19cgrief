	<p> Trial & Sentence?<p>A  Full and Particular Account of the Trial and Sentence of THOMAS<br>M'KAY, who stood his Trial before the Special Commission, at Ayr,<br>on Wednesday, the 9th August, 1820; and who is to be Hanged,"<br>Beheaded and Quartered, on the 15th September, 1820.<p>WEDNESDAY, AUGUST 9.<p>THE Lords Commissioners appointed by the Special Com-<br>mission of Oyer and Terminer, for Trying all Treasons and<br>Misprisions of Treasons, committed within the counties of Stir-<br>ling, Lanark, Dumbarton, Renfrew, and Ayr, opened their<br>proceedings here on Wednesday morning. The following were<br>the Lords Commissioners.?The Lord President of the Court o'<br>Session, the Lord Justice Clerk, the Lord Chief Baron of the<br>Court of Exchequer, the Lord Chief Commissioner. of the Jury<br>Court, and Lord Pitmilly. John Hullock, Esq. Serjeant at<br>Law, assisted at the trials, and Mr. Thomas George Knnpp;<br>Clerk in the Arraigns of the Home Circuit in England, acted<br>as Clerk to the Commissioners.<p>On the part of the Crown the Counsel were the Lord Advo-<br>cate, the Solicitor-General, Mr. Hullock, Mr. H. H. Drum-<br>mond, and Mr. Hope, the Lord Advocate's Deputes, Mr. Men-<br>zies, Mr. Knapp?and Mr. James Arnot, W. S. Agent. On<br>the opposite side. of the table sat, Mr. J. A. Murray, Mr. Gra-.<br>ham, Mr. Monteith, Mr. Pyper, Mr. Cullen, Mr. Miller, and<br>Mr. Sandford, Advocates; and Mr. Harmer, the English Bar-<br>rister, who, we believe, conducted the trials which lately took<br>place at Manchester.?Agent, Mr. Fleming.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -<p>The Court met for business in the Justiciary Hall, and was<br>opened about a quarter past nine o'clock, and in a few min-<br>utes was crowded with people, who eagerly pushed into<br>the Court Hall for the purpose of hearing the trials. The<br>Lord President addressed the Court; after which<p>JOHN DICKIE, HUGH WALLACE, ANDREW WY-<br>LIE, and THOMAS M'KAY, were conducted into Court for<br>trial,all accused of High Treason.<p>Thomas M'Kay was placed at the Bar, when. Mr. Grant<br>(who, together with Mr. Sandford, was Counsel for the prison-<br>ers) stated, that at the request, and by the persuasion of Mr-<br>Sandford and himself, the prisoner was about to apply to the<br>Court for liberty to withdraw the plea of Not Guilty, which he<br>had before pleaded, and to plead Guilty to the fourth count of<br>the indictment, and to throw himself upon the mercy of the<br>Crown. Mr. Grant stated, that although M'Kay's participation<br>of the guilt alleged by the indiclment was not of so aggravated<br>a nature as that of some others included in the charge who had<br>escaped punishment, yet he felt it his duly to recommend this<br>tourse to his cllent, knowing the merclful disposition of His<br>Majesty, and the soundness of the advice which would be given<br>by the Lord Advocate and his other advisers on such<br>Subjects.<p>The Lord Justice Clerk then stated to the prisoner, that he<br>must consider the withdrawing of his plea of Not Guilty and<br>pleadlng Guilty, as.entirely his own not, and that the Court<br>must in consequence proceed to pass sentence of death upon<br>him.The prisoner bowed and formally pleaded Not Guilty.<p>The Lord Advocate stated, it was not his intention to give<br>the Court any Trouble with respect to the remaining three pri-<br>soners, but to consent to their acquittal. His Lordship said it<br>was generally known that the treasonable practices which had<br>prevailed in the neighbouring counties, to so formidable an ex-<br>tent, did not make to great a head in this County, and thnt the<br>persons who had taken the lead in them here had withdrawn<br>from justice; that 18 persons had been indlcted in this County,<br>but only four were in custody; that he thought with his Learn-<br>ed Friend, that those were not so criminal as many others, and<br>that he was still further inclined to this course of proceeding,<br>from a conviction that enough had been done to restore the<br>Country to tranquillity, and to open the eyes of its inhabitants<br>to their real and true situation.<p>A Jury was then sworn, and there being no evidence brought<br>forward against Andrew Wyllie, John Dickie, and Hugh Wal-<br>lace, they were pronounced to be Not Guilty. They were<br>then addressed by the Lord Justice Clerk, and dismissed from<br>the bar, and Thomas M'Kay was brought np to receive his<br>sentence.<p>The Lord Justice Clerk stated, that it was probable the<br>Royal mercy would be extended to him, at the same time it was<br>necersary that he should consider himself in a situation of peril<br>of his life, and exhorted him to repent of his former sins, that<br>he might be the filter to appear before the Throne of the Al-<br>mighty; and that, should the Royal clemency be extended tos<br>wards him, he would not live the worse for having prepared to<br>die. The sentence was in the following words:?" That you<br>be taken to the place from whence you came, and that you<br>be drawn on a hurdle to the place of Execution, on the 15th<br>September; and after being hung by the neck till you be dead,<br>that your head be severed from your body, and your body cut<br>in quarters, to be at the disposal of the King; aud the Lord,<br>have mercy upon your soul."?The prisoner was then taken-<br>from the bar without shewing any signs of agitation.<p>This ends the present Commission. There had been true<br>Bills found against 88 persons, 58 had not appeared; 24 had<br>been capitally convicted; and 23 had been acquitted.<p>Printed by John Muir, Glasgow.</p>
