	<h2>Transcription</h2>
	<p> A correct and Particular Account of the Execution of<br>CHARLES M'EWEN, commonly called " The<br>Cock of the North," who was Hanged on Wednes-<br>day the 7th A April 1824, at the head of Libberton<br>Wynd,Edinburgh for the Barbarous Murder<br>Margaret Mooney, in October last, on a Moor in<br>Aberdeenshire and  his Body given for Dissection<br>with his Behaviour at the Place of Execution.<p>Edinburgh, 7th April, 1824.<p>THIS day, the unfortunate CHARLES M'EWEN, alias M'Eoch<br>and commonly known in the North of Scotland, by' the Cock of the North; <br>ended his mortal career, on a scaffold, at the head of<br>Libberton Wynd here, pursuant to his sentence.<p>This unfortunate man was a native of Ireland, and assumed va-<br>rious names, as circumstances suited him, but was best known by<br>M'Ewen.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He left Ireland about ten years ago, and travelled principally <br>in the counties of Forfar, Aberdeen, and Inverness, as a<br>Tinker, and vender of hardware, &c.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He had had various women<br>with whom he cohabited as man and wife, and had several children.<br>The unhappy woman, Margaret Mooney, had been with him only a<br>few days at the time of the murder. They were travelling together, on<br>the 9th of October last, through the Firmouth, an uninhabited moor<br>or mountain, near the junction of the shires of Aberdeen and For-<br>far ; and, as was proved on his trial, he deliberately murdered her<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;in the most barbarous manner, by striking her on the head with a<br>small Iron Anvil, without any provocation whatever, in consequence<br>of which she died on the spot, and for which he was  soon after ap-<br>prehended.<p>Having emitted two several declarations before the Sheriff-sub-<br>stitutes of Aberdeenshire, in which he denied any knowledge of<br>the circumstance, except seeing the body lying all bloody as he<br>passed, he forced on his trial, by running his letters.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Accordingly<br>he was brought from Aberdeen Jail to Edinburgh, and tried before<br>the High Court of Justiciary, on the 1st of March last; and, after<br>the fullest investigation, was unanimously found Guilty by a res<br>pectable Jury.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a most impressive address from the Lord<br>Justice Clerk, in which he recommended to him to employ the few<br>remaining days allowed him on earth, in the important works of<br>repentance, and to endeavour, by the deepest contrition and heart<br>felt sorrow for his past offences, to make his peace with that God<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;against whom he had so heinously sinned, by the perpetration of a<br>crime, of all others the most foul and deteatable, he was sentenced<br>to be hanged by the hands of the common executioner, on  Wed-<br>nesday the 7th of April next, at the head of Libberton Wynd, be<br>twixt the hours of eight and ten in the morning, and his body there<br>after to be given to Dr. Alex. Monro, to be dissected and anatomiz. <br>ed.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To which he immediately replied,  Thank your Lordship,<br>but I'll die innocent''.<p>During the whole trial, as well as the delivery of this address and<br>pronouncing the awful sentence, M'Ewen appeared quite firm and<br>hardened, nor had he, for a considerable time after his condemna<br>tion, evinced a becoming sense of his melancholy situation.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Neither<br>the certainty of the awful fate which was shortly to overtake him,<br>nor the reflections to which his crime and punishment were likely,<br>in solitude, to give rise, had produced any salutary impressions on<br>his mind ; but, on the contrary, seemed to repel any advances of<br>kindness from those about him.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To the inquiries of one gentleman<br>he abruptly replied, " I am not the better of you, nor any like<br>you."&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To another gentleman, in an official situation, he betrayed<br>similar impatience, and haughtily expressed a wish that he might<br>not receive any more visits of such a nature.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As to the affair that<br>brought him there, he added, it was a matter that concerned himself<br>alone.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He was very restless, and continually moving to the extent<br>of the chain allowed him; in this respect differing from almost<br>every one who was placed in the like unhappy circumstances, while<br>others sought repose, or were sunk into despondency, he was ever<br>in motion.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Latterly, however, he entertained feelings better suited<br>to his situation.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He was a Catholic, and was regularly attended by<br>three clergymen of that persuasion, as well as by some private<br>friends. to whose exhortations, in a great measure, must have been<br>ascribed the great change in  his behaviour.<br> He was a tall, stoutan, about thirty-six years of age.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <p>Edinburgh ...Printed for AlexanderTurnbull...,Price One Penny.</p>
