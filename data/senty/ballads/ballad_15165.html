	<p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  WHIPPING!<p>An Account of the Trial and Sentence of THOMAS<br>HAY, for Stabbing William Moffat, in Leith,on <br>18th of July last and who was, this day, pub-<br>licly whipped through that Town.<p>A Case came on for Trial on the 2d of February, 1824, unpara-<br>  lelled by the recent atrocity in Hertfordshire, and can only<br>be compared to some of the crimes which the busy tongue of ru-<br>mour had alleged against Thurtell and his gang. In the present<br>instance, the accused, Thomas Hay, resided in a solitary manner in<br>a house in King Street, Leith, no living creature cohabited with<br>him Having fitted up his inner room as a human sloughter-house,<br>he set out one morning in July last in quest of his intended victim,<br>whom he decoyed to the place of sacrifice, and against whom he<br>aimed the murderous blow, but happily failed in the accomplish-<br>ment of his diabolical purpose.<p>The indictment having been read, the panel pleaded, " I am not<br>guilty my Lord, but Mr Wilson is guilty of rousing me out of my<br>bed this morning, and bringing me here without my breakfast, a<br>state, I presume, which no one present is in but myself."<p>Mr William Mcffat, Wright  in Leith, said that on the 18th of<br>July last, he was walking, and met the prisoner about 3 in the<br>morn ing, who asked him to go along with him to see some repairs<br>he had to make, and requested him to send away two dogs that fol-<br>lowed the witness, as the pannel had a cat and kittens in the house,<br>When they got in th  house, the pannel locked and bolted the door;<br>prisoner pressed him to go into another room, from the one he first<br>entered, witness did so, and observed to the pannel that his wax-<br>doth on the floor was not properly laid down, for the red side was<br>upper most, and the ends lying against the chairs and bed instead<br>of being laid below them. The pannel invited me to take a glass<br>of spirits, he then said that he had bought some property in Edin-<br>burgh, and wished witness to put up some partitions, and wished<br>him to go and settle with the person he bought the property from,<br>as his leg was so sore he could not go himself, and asked witness<br>to make a receipt, for what money he would entrust him with,<br>which was £228, and rhewed him 12 £20 pound notes. The pan-<br>gave him a letter to read, while doing so he lift up his eyes and saw<br>prisoner standing over him.and making a thrust with a knife, which<br>in ettempting to ward off the blow he received it in his, arm, wit<br>uess wrestled with him, and threw him against the bed, and held<br>him on the floor, and succeeded in taking the knife from him, but<br>got the leader of one of the fingers of the right hand, and the lead-<br>ers of all the fingers of the left hand cut He then opened the<br>door and called for assistance. Prisoner was not intoxtcated at the<br>time. Had nev er quarrelled with the prisoner, nor had any words<br>with the prisoner before he stabbed him.<p>The pannel's declaration was read. Among other things it sta-<br>ted that Mr Moffat made up to the drisoner in Giles strett, on the<br>morning in question, and accompanied him to the house ; that the<br>wound was occasioned by his foot tripping while he had the knife<br>in his hand cuttiud bread and cheese with it, that in falling he up<br>set the table and cut Mr Moffat's arm. He (declarant) was unable<br>ro say where he purchased the knife, which appeared new and never<br>to have been used for any other purpose. He was unable to ac-<br>count for many other eircumstances, and refused to answer several<br>pertinent questions.<p>After observations at considerable length from the public prose-<br>cutor, in which he shewed she enormity of the crime of which<br>the pannel is guilty, and which was powerfully answered by the<br>pannel's agent, the jury deliberated a short time, and returned a<br>verdict of guilty.<p>The Lord Justice Clerk, previous to pronouneing sentcuce, dwelt<br>greatly on the heinous nature of the crime of which the pannel was<br>found guilty, and remarked, that had his case been in England, the<br>last sentence of the law would have been awarded against him, his<br>Lordship then delivered the sentence of the law, viz. that he will<br>be transported beyond seas for the period of 14 years ; and previous<br>to which, to be publicly whipt through the streets of Leith, on<br>Wednesday the 18th February, 1824, which was accordingly done<br>this day.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;PRICE ONE PENNY.</p>
