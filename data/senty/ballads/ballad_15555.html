	<p> Brutal Assault<p>AND <p>MURDER!<p>An Account of a most Brutal Assault,<br>committed on a young woman, to the<br>great effusion of her blood, in a Field<br>off the Glasgow Road, on Saturday<br>evening last, May 22, 1830, and the<br>Miscreant siezed and lodged in the<br>Police Office. Together, with farther<br>Particulars of Murdoch Grant, Pedlar,<br>at Assynt, and of the apprehension of<br>a young man named M'Leod, who<br>was lodged in Jail, on strong suspi-<br>cions of being concerned in this hor-<br>rid transaction.<p>THE following paragraphs are copied from this<br>morning's Observer, detailing the above<br>shocking circumstances, which must be revolting<br>to every friend of humanity, and disgraceful to the<br>age we live in, being now become so common :....<p>' Brutal Assault.?On Saturday evening, between<br>eight and nine o'clock, as a person from Glasgow<br>was on his to Paisley, and while near the Half-way<br>House, his attention was arrested by the cries of a<br>female, which appeared to issue from an adjoining<br>field. He soon came in sight of a fellow in the<br>act of assaulting a woman, whose face, it is stated,<br>was covered with blood. On the man's approach,<br>the assailant fled, but was overtaken at the mo-<br>ment he was nearing the Paisley Road. Fortu-<br>nately at this time a carrier's cart happened to<br>pass, on which the miscreant was hoisted, and<br>safety conveyed to the Paisley Police Office.'<p>' The Murder at Assynt.....After a careful and<p>laborious examination, a young man named M'<br>Leod, a native of the district of Assynt, has been<br>committed to Dornoch Jail, on being an acces-<br>sary, if not a principal, in the recent murder of<br>Murdoch Grant, a pedlar, at Assynt, in Suther-<br>landshire. We formerly stated that the sheriff<br>of this town (Inverness) while attending the cir-<br>cuit, and his labours, we understand, in traver-<br>sing that wild, inhospitable country, and eliciting<br>every circumstance connected with the appalling<br>event, have been unremitting. The first sight of<br>the body convinced ,the examinators that the de-<br>ceased met his death by violence. It was dread-<br>fully bruised and mangled, apparently with a<br>hatchet. It was also discovered that the murder<br>must have taken place at a short distance from<br>the lake, as on one spot the heather was covered<br>with blood, and bore marks of a severe struggle<br>having taken place. After lying here, apparently<br>for some days, the body had been dragged along<br>the ground and thrown into the lake. The de-<br>ceased had left his parish of Lochbroom with<br>L.50 worth of goods in his pack, and money on<br>his person to the amount of L.5, and it was as-<br>certained that before the time of his being missed,<br>he had sold nearly all his goods, consequently,<br>the booty secured by the murderer must have been<br>considerable. Suspicion alighted on M'Leod, from<br>his changing a L.5 bank note, he having before<br>been in the utmost poverty, and without any ob-<br>vious means of raising such a sum. On examina-<br>tion, he is said to have prevaricated, and other<br>suspicious circumstances transpired against him,<br>he was committed to Dornoch Jail. Additional<br>information has been obtained since the return of<br>the Sheriff of Sutherlandshire from As synt, tend-<br>ing to confirm the suspicions against M'Leod, and<br>also tending to implicate another individual in the<br>guilt of that transaction. Inverness Courier.<p>Death<p>OF THE<p>KING.<p>It is with deep and most heartfelt sorrow<br>and regret, that we have to announce the<br>death of our much beloved Sovereign, which<br>took place at Windsor, on Saturday morning<br>June 26, at a quarter past 3 o'clock, having<br>reigned in peace ten year, four month and 27<br>days.<p>His Majesty was born on the 12th, and<br>created Prince of Wales on the 17th August<br>1762; was married on 8th April 1795, to<br>his cousin, Princess Caroline Amelia of<br>Brunswick, by whom he had the late much<br>lamented Princess Charlotte Augusta, who<br>died in childbed on 6th November 1817;<br>was appointed Regent in February 1811 ;<br>succeeded his father on 29th January 1820 ;<br>was crowned on the 19th July 1821 ; visit-<br>ed Scotland August 1822.<p><p>The late King is succeeded by Prince Wil-<br>liam Henry, Duke of Clarence and St An-<br>drews, &c. who was born on 21st August<br>1765; married on 11th July 1818, to the<br>Princess Adelaide Louisa Theresa Caroline<br>Amelia, eldest daughter of the late and sister<p>to the present Duke of Saxe Meinenge.........<p>The issue of the marriage was, the Princess<br>Charlotte Augusta, born and died 27th<br>March 1819, and the Princess Elizabeth,<br>born 10th December 1820, and died 4th<br>March the following year.<p>The Earl of Errol, the Hon. John Erskine<br>Kennedy (second son of the Earl of Cassilis),<br>Mr Philip Sydney, M.P., for Eye, and Lieut-<br>Colonel Charles Fox of the 34th Eegiment of<br>Foot, stand in relation of sons-in-law to the<br>present King, having married the Misses<br>Elizabeth, Augusta, Sophia and Mary Fitz-<br>clarence. Colonel Fitzclarence, of the Royal<br>Fusileers, married in 1821, Lady Augusta<br>Boyle, daughter of the Earl of Glasgow, and<br>Colonel George Fitzclarence is son-in-law to<br>the Earl of Egremont. Captain Adolphus<br>Fitzclarence, R.N., and the Rev.
