	<p> A full, true, & particular Account<p>OF ALL<p>THE DOGS,<p>WHICH MEET EVERY TUESDAY, AT<p>THE GRAND TOWN-COUNCIL KENNEL,<p>With a full description of all their qualities, as exhibited at the<p>PROVOST HUNT,<p>On TUESDAY, 29th November 1842.<p><p>1st?Chimpanzee, or Sleepy-Jamie, a small liver coloured puppy, a most unhappy tem-<br>pered whelp, a great snarler, bites right and left, has evidently a touch of mange, not liked in<br>the Kennel from his bad propensities ; this dog had his tail bit off last month, which has<br>made him much more vicious.<p>2d.?Client. This dog is good tempered, with training would make a good retreiver, but<br>posseses the vice of smelling bitches when sent an errand, and often lags by the water-side.<p>3d?Tot. A Scotch poodle-dog, good tempered, and though slow, follows steady : from<br>his general appearance he seems to have been pupped with a silver-spoon in his mouth, and<br>if put on low diet, might do his work better.<p>4th?Solicitor. Is a staunch West-country dog, of the Deer-hound breed, has a good<br>nose, he is a sure leader on the scent .<p>5th?Pomatum. A soft-haired dog, has lately come out as a leader in the Pack, has more<br>bottom than brains, and smells strong of his lair.<p>6th?Baps. A ferocious looking dog, a good ratter, though he is understood to have<br>none of the Terrier in him, being a cross between the lurcher and the colley; is easily cowed<br>by the Whipperin, but hunts well in the Parsons' pack.<p>7th?Dean. A Poodle, was trained by a Stockingweaver, who kept him for his wool;<br>of course, not well bred ; and when he breaks from the kennel, is often found in strange<br>company. This dog wants pluck, and at a sharp brush may be found running south with his<br>tail between his legs.<p>8th? Bangor.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A slate coloured dog, is fond of giving mouth on a false scent ; runs after<br>the boys when they cry " Maister, Maister," a thorough messen, seems proud of his hair, and<br>at night often earths at the foot of Leith Wynd.<br>  (All these dogs are kept chained, that they may frighten, but not worry Beggars & Thieves.)<p>9th?Knight. This dog is good at starting game, but wants perseverance to hunt it down ;<br>he is a general favourite in the Pack, though often at fault ; he is sickly, which may account for<br>his apparent want of energy and bottom.<p>10th?Schneider. A clumsy dog, a sort of nondescript, a regular babbler, bred by a<br>tailor, too fat for work, often mangie, which he cures by eating bow-kail. The trail of an old<br>buckle will lead him off the scent.<p>11th? Brush. A good sharp dog, makes no noise and runs close; always in at the death,<br>and has turned up a great many hares in his day.<p>12th?Typo. A large stout clumsy dog. has damaged his teeth worrying his neighbours. 'when<br>kept in the Police Kennel ; having been found straying unmuzzled, on the High street, during<br>the dog days ; he was presented to this Kennel by the Gentlemen of the first ward, who had<br>long hunted with him and prized him much ; a quiet dog, but very ferocious when at-<br>tacked : Chimpanzee goes much easier to his work when this dog is muzzled : on the<br>whole, an ugly customer.<p>13th?Pompey. A vain dog, a cross between a turnspit and a lady's poodle, doubles on<br>the scent, so that no good dog will follow his lead, silky haired, and bites his own tail, very<br>fond of burrowing in meadows, where he lately found a Mare's Nest ; has a good nose after<br>stolen goods, and was much prized for this in the Police Kennel ; snuffs keenly at turf.<p>14th?Wasp. A wiry-haired Scotch Terrier, entered to the vermin by a thin Mason ; fond<br>of burrowing in the Cowgate, where he finds Game to his taste ; backs Typo in barking at<br>Chimpanzee. He and Typo hunt well in couples ; he is of the right sort.<p>15th?Cleaver. A large rough grey Sheep-dog, with a stubborn temper, and a few<br>good points.<p>16th?Quill. A smooth Terrier, staunch at his work ; makes no noise in the Kennel.<p>17th?Cameleon. A smooth oily-skinned sad dog, on which none can depend, apt to slip<br>out of the hands of the Whipperin ; invariably lifts his leg on the stone which Chimpanzee<br>has watered : was turned out of the Kennel for the mange, but was driven back by the mob<br>and the Parsons' Pack : howls loud when the Whipper lashes Chimpanzee.<p>18th?Bolus. A small light dog, seems from his smell to roll himself up in assaf?tida,<br>barks vicious whenever Chimpanzee shows his teeth ; is apt to be led off the scent when a<br>Parson crosses it; otherwise a good dog.<p>19th-Pewter-Pot.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A long lank useless whyte dog.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; N.B.?May be had cheap.<p>20th?Tick-Tick. A slovenly meagre dog, lately taken into the Kennel for want of a<br>better : is in bad condition, though a good feeder ; was a snarler, but is quiet under Chim-<br>panzee and Cameleon ; looks ill as his coat is bad.<p>21st?Hairy. An old dog of great bottom ; a Mastiff with a dash of the Bull in him,<br>holds well, and at a worry shews more game than the whole Pack ; has a panchent for rub-<br>bing against cloth.<p>22d?Brief. A Foxhound of the true breed, has a great antipathy to Asses, sometimes<br>shy, but when roused, he goes through his work in earnest, and with effect; supposed to have<br>been pupped on Logan Braes.<p>23d?Ruble. Got by Plaster. A pawky dog, but is understood to hunt well when stark<br>and unincumbered with couples.<p>24th?Hod.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; An old stiff dog, nearly worn out, always lifts his leg after Chimzpanzee.<p>25th?Crispin. A dull heavy dog, good for nothing, except appearance ; howls loud when<br>out of the Kennel, but never in it.?A dog of no pluck.<p>26th?Ned.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  A lame dog but a good one.<p>27th?Bill-the- Younger. A young dog not much known, but shews good points : if well<br>trained, will prove useful.<p>28th?Exchange.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A quiet good dog, but easily led off the scent by a Church or a Parson.<p>29th?Clifton.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A high bred and gentle dog, but sometimes loses scent like the former.<p>30th?Doctor.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A harmless dog ; has swallowed many pills, prescribed by the Parsons.<p>31st?Tory.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A singularly coloured dog, considered staunch, new to the Pack.<p>32d?Conservatine. This dog is not new to the Pack, is well known, feeds well, and is<br>very quiet<p>33d?Kipps. A new dog, black and tanned, from Forfarshire, is rather quiet, but expec-<br>ted to be a good working Terrier, particularly in drawing Apes and such-like vermin.</p>
