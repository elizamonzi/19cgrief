	<p> Susan's Adventures.  Napoleon's Farewell to Paris.<p>Young Susan was a blooming maid.<br>So valliant stout and bold,<br>And when her sailor went on board, <br>Young Susan we are told, <br>Put on a jolly sailor's dress,<br>And daubed her hands with tar,<br>To cross the raging seas for love,<br>On board of a man-of-war.<p>It was in  Portsmouth barbout,<br>This gallant ship was moored.<br>And when young Susan shipped,<br>There was nine hundred men on board,<br>It was then she was contented,<br>All bedaubed with pitch and tar.<br>To be with her sweet William.<br>On board of a man-of-war,<p>She washed the decks both fore and aft,<br>In winds and tempest cold<br>With her hands so soft she went alost,<br>Like a jolly sailor bold,<br>She kept her place, with her pretty face,<br>Bedaubed with pitch and tar<br>And no one Susan did suspect,<br>On board of a man-of-war.'<p>When in the Bay of Biscay,<br>She aloft like lightning  flew,<br>Respected by the officers,<br>And all the jovial crew,<br>In battle she would boldly run,<br>Fearing neither wound nor scar,<br>And do her duty by the gun.<br>On board of a man-of-war.<p>She faced the walls of China,<br>Where her life was not insured, <br>And little did young William think,<br>His Susan, was on board,<br>By a cannon ball from the batteries,<br>She did receive a scar,<br>And she got slightly wounded,<br>On board of a man-of-war.<p>When on the deck young Susan fell,<br>Of all the whole ships crew,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  <br>Her William was the very first,<br>To her assistance flew,<br>She said my jolly sailor,<br>I've for you received a scar<br>Behold your faith full Susan bold,<br>On board of a man-of-war.<p>Then William on his Susan gazed,<br>With wonder and surprise.<br>He stood some moments  motionless,<br>While tears rolled from his eyes,<br>He cried I wish Instead of you<br>I had received that scar,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  <br>Oh, love why did you venture,<br>On board of a man-of-war.<p>At length to England they returned,<br>And quickly married were,<br>The bells  did ring and they'did sing,<br>And banish every care. <br>They often think upon that day,<br>When she received a scar,<br>And Susan followed her true love,<br>On board of a man-of-war.<p>FAREWELL ye splendid citadels, that metropolis call'd Paris,<br>Where Phoebes every morning shoots forth her revolving beams;<br>Where Flora's bright Aurora advancing from the orient.<br>With radient light adorning the pure shining streams.<br>At eve when Nectar retires, and the ocean glides like fire<br>And the universe admire her merchandise in store,<br>Commanding Flora's fragrance, the fertile fields to decorate,<br>To illuminate that royal Corsican again on the French shore.<p>My name is Napoleon Buonaparte, I'm conqueror of nations,<br>I've banished German legions, and drove kings from their throne<br>I've conquer'd dukes and earls, in splendid congregations,<br>Tho' they have transported me to St. Helena shore.<br>Like Hannibal, I've cross'd the Alps, burning sands, and rocky<br>cliffs,<br>O'er Russian bills, through frost and snow, I still the laural wore<br>I'm in a desert island where the rats ?the d------l would affright<br>Yet I hope to shine in armour bright, through europe once more.<p>Some say the first of my downfall was parting from my consort<br>To wed the German's daughter, which grieved me full sore,<br>But the female train I ne'er will blame, for she ne'er did me despair<br>She saw my sword in battle flame, and did me adore,<br>And I severely felt the rod, for meddling with the house of God  <br>Coins and golden images, by thousands away I tore,<br>I stole Malta's golden gates, I did works of God disgrace,<br>But if he gives me time and place, back to him I will restore.<p>My golden eagles were pull'd down by Wellington's allied army,<br>My troops all disordered. I could no longer stand the field<br>I, alas, was sold that afternoon, all on the 18th of June,<br>My reinforcement prov'd traitorous ; which caused me to yield,<br>I'm it allied yoke, with fire and sword I made them smoke,<br>I've conquer'd Dutch and Danes, and surprised the grand Signor,<br>I've defeated Austrians and Russians, Portuguese and Prussians<br>Like Joshua, Alexander, or Casar of yore.<p>Now to the south of Africa and the Atlantic ocean.<br>To view the mild emotion and the flowing of the tide,<br>Banished from that royal crown of imperial promotion,<br>From the French throne of glory, to see those billows glide,<br>Three days I've stood the plain, liberty's cause to maintain,<br>Thousand. I've left slain end bleeding in their gore ;<br>I ne'er fled without revenge, nor co the allied army cringe,<br>But now my sword is sheathed and Paris is no more,<p>British Man-of-War.<p>It was in yon meadows I carelessly did stray. <br>And I beheld a lady fair with some young sailor gay;<br>He said, my lovely Susan, I soon must leave thee here,<br>And to cross the briny ocean in a British Man-of-War.<p>Pretty Susan fell a weeping, oh you ng; sailor, she did say,<br>How can you be so venturesome to throw yourself away<br>It's when that I am 21,I shall receive my store,<br>Jolly sailor do not venture in a British Man-of-War<p>Susan lovely Susan, the truth to you I will tell,<br>The British flag's insulted, old England knows it wed,<br>may be crowned with laurels, so like a jolly tar,<br>I will face the walls of China, in a British Man-of-War.<p>O sailor do not venture to face the prend Chinese,<br>For they will prove as treacherous as any Portugese,<br>And by some deadly dagger you may receive a scare,<br>So it's turn your inclination from a British Man-of-War.<p>Susan, lovely Susan, the time will quickly pass.<br>So come down to the Ferry-house, and take a parting glass,<br>My ship-mates  they are waiting to row me from the shore,<br>And it's for'old  England's glory in a British Man-of-War.<p>Then the sailor took his handkerchief and cut it fair in two<br>O Susan. keep one hull for me, and I'll do the same for you,<br>The bullets may surround me and cannos loudly roar,<br>I'll fight for lame and Susan in a British Man-of-War.'<p>Then a few more words together when her love let go her<br>hand,<br>The jovial crew they launched the boat right merrily from<br>the land;<br>The sailor waved his handkerchief when far away from<br>shore,<br>Pretty Susan blest her sailor in a British Man-of-war.</p>
