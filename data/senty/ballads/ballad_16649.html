	<p> WHIGGERY'S<p>Withered Trunk put forth a Leaf.<p>THE County of Roxburgh was already tired with the foolish, bom-<br>bastic, and unmeaning offusions of sciolistic and shallow witted Politicians;<br>the walls had been covered with Placards containing recitals and re-recitals<br>of circumstances which had no existence, save in the imaginations of their<br>authors ; and every body was anxiously longing for the cessation of such<br>bare faced effrontery, when the public was again troubled with the Letter<br>of a fellow Elector, setting forth the brilliant and extraordinary success<br>of the Honourable Captain G. ELLIOT, in a style of language, in pompo-<br>sity and bombast far exceeding any former production of the kind, and<br>alike destitute of any thing that is to be found in sound argument, as it is<br>of common sense.<p>Let it be observed that the Captain's return to Parliament is by no<br>means yet ascertained to be so sure as this Elector would fain make it to<br>be believed; but that there yet exists some doubt as to the certain occur-<br>rence of this event even in his mind, is very evident, from the strenuous<br>efforts he makes to forward his cause ; nay more, it is positively affirmed<br>that the brilliant and triumphant success of CAPTAIN ELLIOT exists only<br>in the minds of his hired and blustering braggadocios.<p>Notwithstanding of all that has been said and sung of CAPTAIN<br>ELLIOT'S Claims upon this County, I would ask, WHAT ARE THEY ?<br>His story may be made plain and simple, and told in a very few words, -<br>He was a Naval Captain for about 26 years, he has been a Secretary to<br>the Admiralty for one year, and during all that time, (having nothing<br>worthy of credit to the contrary) it may be concluded that he drew his<br>pay, and acted just like any other person under similar circumstances.<br>But oh ! how amusing it is to see how his exploits are wrought up so as<br>to approach almost to the marvellous: we are told he was at the siege of<br>this, and assisted at the blockade of that; was at the demolishing of this <br>fortress, and the storming of that citadel; and, in short, his exploits are<br>made nearly to match With those of Jack the Giant Killer, or the Adven-<br>tures of Robinson Crusoe; and when these are credited and admired,<br>CAPTAIN ELLIOT'S Claims for praise may then be given in.<p>The two Competitors in the field of Roxburgh do in some respects<br>resemble each other; neither of them has one fur of land in the County ;<br>they are both already in the service of their Country; they are both per-<br>sonally respectable, and scions of respectable and noble families; they are<br>both alike untutored in parliamentary business; in these things they re-<br>semble : in others, there is less similitude; in the number of their years<br>they differ widely; and lastly, they differ wider far in their oratorial and<br>intellectual endowments, - the one talks like a clown, the other like a<br>thorough bred orator, - the one appears a giant in intellect, the other only<br>a schoolboy.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  <p>One word regarding this person who calls himself a Fellow Elector ;<br>what a kindly fellow feeling he seems to have with the Honourable CAP-<br>TAIN, how cruse he is ! but oh, methinks, how he will quake and tremble<br>when the subject of unmerited Pensions is brought before a Reformed<br>Parliament; and his services to his country will have to be brought out<br>in array, and the question will be asked, WHAT WERE THEY ?<p>And one word to my good Electors ! be not swayed by the fulsome<br>stuff that is offered to you, but let your own judgment direct you in your<br>choice ; come and examine the Candidates for your suffrages, and when<br>you do this bring with you the scales of candour, cleansed from the rust<br>of prejudice by the hands of intelligent modesty.<p>Wishing you much joy in your new privileges,<br>I am yours,<p>A LOOKER ON.<br>5th Sept. 1832.<p></p>
