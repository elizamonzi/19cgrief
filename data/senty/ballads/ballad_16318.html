Adieu, fair France, to thee !"<br>The breeze comes forth?she is alone on the unconscious sea.<p>The scene was changed.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It was an eve of raw and surly mood,<br>And in a turret-chamber high of ancient Holyrood<br>Sat Mary, listening to the rain, and sighing with the winds,<br>That seemed to suit the stormy state of men's uncertain minds.<br>The touch of care had blanched her cheek?her smile was sadder now,<br>The weight of royalty had pressed too heavy on her brow ;<br>And traitors to her councils came, and rebels to the field;<br>The Stuart sceptre well she swayed, but the sword she could not wield.<br>She thought of all her blighted hopes?the dreams of youth's brief day,<br>And summoned Rizzio with his lute, and bade the minstrel play<br>The songs she loved in early years?the songs of gay Navarre,<br>The songs, perchance, that erst were sung by gallant Chatelar :<br>They half beguiled her of her cares, they soothed her into smiles,<br>They won her thoughts from bigot zeal, and fierce domestic broils ;<br>But hark ! the tramp of armed men ! the Douglas' battle cry !<br>They come?they come ; and lo ! the scowl of Ruthven's hollow eye !<br>And swords are drawn, and daggers gleam, and tears and words are vain,<br>The ruffian steel is in his heart?the faithful Rizzio's slain !<br>Then Mary Stuart brushed aside the tears that trickling fell ;<br>" Now for my father's arm !" she said, " My woman's heart farewell !"<p>The scene was changed.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It was a lake, with one small, lonely isle,<br>And there, within the prison walls of its baronial pile,<br>Stern men stood menacing their queen, till she should stoop to sign<br>The traitorous scroll that snatched the crown from her ancestral line ;<br>" My lords ! my lords !" the captive said, " Were I but once more free,<br>With ten good knights on yonder shore to aid my cause and me,<br>That parchment would I scatter wide to every breeze that blows,<br>Aud once more reign a Stuart Queen o'er my remorseless foes !"<br>A red spot burned upon her cheek, streamed her rich tresses down,<br>She wrote the words.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She stood erect?a queen without a crown !<p>The scene was changed.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A royal host a royal banner bore,<br>And the faithful of the land stood round their smiling queen once more ;<br>She stayed her steed upon a hill?she saw them marching by?<br>She heard their shouts?she read success in every flashing eye ;<br>The tumult of the strife begins?it roars?it dies away ;<br>And Mary's troops and banners now, and courtiers?where are they ?<br>Scattered and strewn, and flying far, defenceless and undone?<br>Oh ! God ; to see what she has lost, and think what guilt has won !<br>Away !?away ! thy gallant steed must act no laggard's part ;<br>Yet vain his speed, for thou dost bear the arrow in thy heart.<p>The scene was changed.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Beside the block a sullen headsman stood,<br>And gleamed the broad axe in his hand that soon must drip with blood.<br>With slow and steady step there came a lady through the hall, .<br>And breathless silence chained the lips, and touched the hearts of all;<br>Rich were the sable robes she wore?her white veil round her fell,<br>And from her neck there hung  the cross?the cross she loved so well.<br>I knew that queenly form again, though blighted was its bloom ;<br>I saw that grief had decked it out?an offering for the tomb !<br>I knew the eye, though faint its light, that once so brightly shone ;<br>I knew the voice, though feeble now, that thrilled with every tone;<br>I knew the ringlets, almost gray, once threads of living gold,<br>I knew that bounding grace of step?that symmetry of mould.<br>Even now I  see her far away, in that calm convent aisle,<br>I hear her chant her vesper-hymn, I mark her holy smile,<br>Even now I see her bursting forth upon her bridal morn,<br>A new star in the firmament, to light and glory born.<br>Alas ! the change ; she placed her foot upon a triple throne,<br>And on the scaffold now she stands?beside the block, alone !<br>The little dog that licks her hand, the last of all the crowd<br>Who sunned themselves beneath her glance, and round her footsteps bowed.<br>Her neck is bared?the blow is struck?the soul is passed away?<br>The bright?the beautiful?is now a bleeding piece of clay !<br>The dog is moaning piteously ; and, as it gurgles o'er,<br>Laps the warm blood that trickling runs unheeded to the floor !<br>The blood of beauty, wealth, and power?the heart-blood of a queen?<br>The noblest of the Stuart race?the fairest earth hath seen?<br>Lapped by a dog !&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Go ; think of it in silence and alone ;<br>Then weigh against a grain of sand the glories of a throne.<p>P R I N  T I N G<p>Of every description executed on the premises, with Expedition, Accuracy, Neatness, and Punctuality, at very Moderate Prices.<br>Parties will receive every assistance in drawing out the Form of their Orders, and will be shown numerous specimens to select<br>from.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Orders sent per Post, 'Bus, or Rail, with the utmost despatch.<br>Saturday, October 27, 1877.</p>
