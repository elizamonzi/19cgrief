	<p> THIRD EDITION OP THE GILMERTON&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<p>MURDERERS.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<p><p>How now!&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ye secret, black, and midnight Fiends !<br>What's this ye do ?&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <p>A deed without a name :- Shakespeare<p><br>HIGH COURT OF JUSTICIARY.- July 12, 1830.<p>Third Edition of the Horrors of Gilmerton,<br>containing a full, true, and particular Ac-<br>count, not only of the Trial, but of the Be-<br>haviour of David Dobie and John Thomson<br>since their condemnation, in the Lock-up-<br>house, and in the Condemned Cell, being<br>tantamount to a Confession of the justice of<br>their Sentence, and also the solemn and<br>awful Speeches of Lord Meadowbank and<br>the Lord justice Clerk, in passing Sentence<br>of Death and dissection, word for word, as<br>they were spoken to the Prisoners.<p>On the way from the Court to the Lock-<br>up house, both the prisoners maintained the<br>same appearance as they had done throughout<br>the trial?that is to say, there was a restless<br>recklessness in Dobie's movements and in the<br>expression of his countenance while Thomson<br>was collected, silent, and seemingly quite<br>passive in the hands of his conductors. There<br>was, however, an occasional quivering of his<br>person, and a solemn thoughtful expression<br>on his pallid countenance, which indicated<br>that he felt more than he wished should be<br>observed by the spectators,<p>Until the evidence hud been all gone<br>through, Dobie indulged a hone of being ac-<br>quitted ; for he had adopted means for secur-<br>ing, as he thought, evidence in his favour.<br>While he was in the jail, he wrote a letter to<br>one of his cousins, a female residing in Gil-<br>merton, instructing her to swear that she had<br>seen Thomson give him the tin box belonging<br>to Margaret Paterson ; and this would have<br>accounted for one of the strongest circum-<br>stances against him. The letter, however,<br>never reached the hands of the woman. It was<br>intercepted, and given to the Sheriff, who<br>sent for the female, and by an interrogatory<br>ascertained that this was an attempt to suborn<br>A witness, and consequently frustrated it. It<br>was perhaps for the same reason that several<br>persons from Gilmerton, who were in the list<br>of witnesses, were not called to give their<br>evidence for the Crown, us it was probable,<br>from their intimacy with the prisoners, and<br>other circumstances, that Dobie might have<br>been tampering with them also.<p>In the Lock-up house, Dobie said that<br>some of the witnesses had sworn falsely ; but<br>this was chiefly in reference to the amount of<br>silver that the poor murdered woman had had<br>in her possession.<p>At seven o'clock in the morning, the pri-<br>soners were placed in the usual carriage to<br>be conveyed back to the jail. After they had<br>taken their seats, a tear or two were observed<br>In the eyes of Thomson. Doble wept plenti-<br>fully, and lamented for his wile and children.<br>( He had sent a sixpence to his wife while the<br>trial was going on, the day before, by one of<br>the witnesses.)?Thomson soon assumed his<br>usual appearance of indifference. He fre-<br>quently looked at the people through the car-<br>riage, and remarked that it was ' a fine morn-<br>ing !'<p>When they got into the condemned cell,<br>Dobie said to Thomson, ' If the woman had<br>been in my cairt, Jock, naething o' this wud<br>hae happened. The woman was a murdered<br>woman,?there's nae doot o' that i But hoo<br>thae stanes an' hay an' things cam' aboot,<br>(he added with an oath) I dinna ken.' Thom-<br>son made no answer to all this, which must<br>be regarded as a confession by Dobie that he<br>was concerned in the crimes, though not in<br>the worst of them ; and Thomson's silence<br>was a still stronger though tacit admission of<br>the full measure of his own guilt,?particularly<br>as neither of the prisoners made one single<br>complaint of the justice of their sentences.<br>Dobie spoke often of his wife and children,<br>for whom he lamented the disgrace he had<br>brought on them; and he expressed his hope<br>that his mother and his wife would be admit-<br>ted to see him. Thomson never once opened<br>his mouth. Dobie put an end to the scene,<br>by saying, ' Come, bring us thae claes (mean-<br>ing the prison dress ;} an' let's pit aft thir<br>yins.' The behaviour of the men, since, has<br>been firm, and becoming their situation.<p>THE TRIAL<p>The jury retired between one and two o'-<br>clock in the morning; and after an absence of<br>about ten minutes, returned and proaonnced<br>by their Chancellor the following verdict:?<br>My Lords, the jury unanimously find both<br>the pannels Guilty of the Robbery, the Mar-<p>The Lord Justice-Clerk, in discharging the<br>Jury, stated that the verdict which they had<br>returned was perfectly consonant with the<br>opinions entertained by the Court. Sentence<br>was then moved for.<p>Lord Meadowbank.?My Lord justice<br>Clerk?It is little more than eighteen months <br>ago that the melancholy duty devolved on me<br>to propose sentence of death on a pannel con-<br>victed before you of a crime at that time con-<br>sidered almost unparalleled in atrocity. The<br>utmost stretch of bur imagination then did not<br>\ill\ us to anticipate the psosibility, that there<br>were living in the midst of civilized society mem<br>who could be guilty of still greater atrocities<br>?of more unparalleled brutality?revolting<br>to every feeling that actuates the mind of man.<br>I am perfectly certain that, were the details<br>of this case unfortunately made public, as,<br>thank God, the power of the law has enabled<br>you to prevent, those details would have ex-<br>cited such feelings in this Christian communi-<br>ty as never were before excited. It is hardly<br>possible to imagine that persons would have<br>been found living in this Christian land who<br>could have brought their minds to the com-<br>mission of such atrocious crimes. Melancholy<br>it is to think that, had this unprotected female<br>been wandering the world amongst the most<br>barbarous people, she would have been in a<br>state of comparative safety to what she was<br>within three miles of the metropolis of this<br>most civilized country ; such is the fact that<br>this poor unhappy woman, after having fallen<br>into the hands of these abandoned men, was<br>treated in a manner which, of necessity, was<br>to produce death?she was robbed of the mis-<br>erable pittance which she had in her posses-<br>sion ; and this was committed OB a person on<br>whom they had the intention to satisfy other<br>brutal passions. This is the worst feature of<br>the case. I have not words to express the<br>feelings which the details of this day have<br>necessarily excited in my bosom. I have al-<br>luded to them generally, and shall only far-<br>ther allude to them by saying, that I think it<br>was impossible for any human being, who<br>heard the evidence, to entertain a doubt of<br>the perfect propriety of the verdict which has<br>been returned. With these observations, I<br>have now simply to propose to your Lordship<br>to pronounce the sentence of the law, which<br>is that of death, and that it shall be carried<br>into effect on Wednesday the 18th of August<br>next.<p>The Lord Justice Clerk?John Thomson<br>and David Dobie, you have heard the verdict<br>which has been recorded, and the opinions<br>which their lordships entertain in regard to<br>your case as exhibited in evidence against yon ;<br>and following their example,?feeling that no<br>words which I can use are capable of describ-<br>ing the unparalleled brutality, cruelty, and<br>wickedness, of the foul transaction which has<br>been disclosed this day. I shall not enter into<br>details farther than to remark that the exhi-<br>bition you have made is calculated to make<br>every man blush. Such wickedness and brutal<br>abomination could not have been believed to<br>have been committed, had it not been sworn<br>to in evidence. Following the principle of law.<br>by which the proceedings have been conduct-<br>ed with closed doors till this stage of the pro<br>ceedings, I shall refrain from saying any thing<br>of the crimes of which you stand convicted on.<br>the clearest evidence ever produced before a<br>jury. But it is my duty to warn you to pre-<br>pare for the inevitable fate which awaits you<br>in this world ; and 1 warn you, in the most.<br>earnest manner, to prepare to appear before<br>the judgment seat of the Almighty, to answer<br>for all the deeds done in the body. Rest as-<br>sured that if ever there was a case in which<br>the law will take it full course it is yours'.<br>You are now to consider that your days on<br>earth are numbered, and that you have now<br>no other duty in the world but to pray for<br>forgiveness of all your crimes?to humble<br>yourselves at the footstool of your Creator-<br>Do not lose a single moment in setting about<br>heartfelt repentance?and God grant that it<br>may be sincere,?and that forgiveness be ex-<br>tended to you for your crimes. His Lordship<br>then sentenced the pannels to be executed at<br>Edinburgh, on the 18th August and their<br>bodies given to Dr Monro, professor of ana-<br>tomy for dissection.<p>Dobie addressed the Lord Justice Clerk in<br>these words, " My Lord, I have one thing to<br>say, if you please.- They cannot dissect the<br>soul !".<p>Forbes and Owen, Printers. - [Price One Penny]</p>
