	<h2>Transcription</h2>
	<p> The second last Speech of Mort Collins, who was execute at Glas-<br>gow on Wednesday the seventh of Novr, 1792, for the murder<br>of John Panton, giving an account of his behaviour in prison and<br>on the scaffold. To which is added the copy of a letter wrote<br>with his own hand to a friend. Also, the copy of a letter he  <br>received from Capt. Cook, while under sentence of death.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<p>The unfortunate Mort Collins, some days<br>Before his execution, seemed to be much a-<br>gitated in his mind, crying out at times so as<br>to be heard through the streets; on Monday<br>morning he received the sacrament from a<br>priest of the Roman profession, he was attend-<br>ed on Tuesday night and Wednesday Morn-<br>ing by some friends of that persuasion.-A-<br>bout two o'clock, the Magistrates accompa-<br>nied by the Revd. Dr. Taylor, who attend-<br>ed at their request went into the Court-hall,<br>where the prisoner was seated, holding in his<br>hand the Roman Catholic service book for<br>prisoners, from which he immediately began<br>to read, with seeming devotion; the prayers<br>for prisoners going to, and at, the place of e-<br>xecution. After these were ended, Dr. Tay-<br>lor took the opportunity of saying, that, if it<br>was not disagreeable, he wished to speak with<br>him a little, and to join in prayer: to this Col-<br>lins replied, that "your prayers may be very<br>good, but I do not know any prayers ex-<br>cept those of my own communion, and by<br>them I chuse to abide." He then read<br>the Apostles Creed, and the devotional exer-<br>cises annexed to it in the Service Book, on<br>faith, hope, charity, patience, and resignation.<br>After again declining to join in prayer with<br>the Minister present, he read, a second time,<br>the prayers for prisoners going to, and at the<br>place of execution.  He then bowed respec-<br>tfully to the Magistrates; still declining any<br>conversation.  Having drank a glass of wine,<br>he walked to the scaffold much agitated; where<br>he spent some time in reading prayers.  He<br>then ascended the platform, and having taken<br>farewell of the executioner, he read for some<br>time on a book afterwards his cap was put over<br>his face, which he put up several times and<br>called for the innerkeeper of the tolbooth to<br>take farewell of him, and soon after he gave<br>the signal when he was launched into eterni-<br>ty a little after three o'clock, in the presence<br>of a great concourse of spectators; and having<br>hung the usual time, he was cut down, and<br>the body delivered to the professor of Anato-<br>my for dissection, agreeably to the sentence<br>of the Court.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He was born in the County<br>of Clare, Ireland, and only twenty-two years<br>of age.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  <p>Copy of a letter from COLLENS to a friend,<br>Glasgow Tolbooth, 24th Octob, 1792.<p>DEAR SIR,<p>"I received your letter,<br>which gives me a deal of pleasure to hear you<br>are all well; my dear friends, you may be<br>sure that I intend to make the best use of my<br>time that I possibly can, and with the assist-<br>ance of God, I hope to die in peace with<br>God and the world, I am now visited by some<br>of my own profession, which gives me much<br>pleasure and relief, and in a short time I ex-<br>pect to have the benefit of some Clergy of<br>my own profession, which will make me quite<br>happy in my present miserable state, for no-<br>thing can give me greater pleasure than  to<br>die in the religion I was brought up to.  As <br>for writing to my parents, I know not what<br>to think of it; my dear friends, the shock of<br>it will be insupportable to them, who loved<br>me with such unbounded tenderness, it can<br>never be born by them; the distraction it will<br>cause in them, I am afraid, will end their<br>days.  If possible, I should wish them never<br>to hear of it, my dear friends, it is not my<br>horrid destiny that afflicts my troubled soul,<br>but the unsupportable horror that will seize<br>my dear parents, that grieves me to the heart;<br>my dear friends, how different will be the<br>account that I must be forced to send them<br>from the last account they received from me,<br>that was a pleasing account which give them<br>much delight, but how horrid will this ac-<br>count of my ignominious death be to them,<br>they will hear it.  O how happy would I be<br>if they never would hear of it, but it will be<br>known to them sometime.  O blessed be the<br>name of God that has supported me since I<br>have fallen by these cruel wretches but it<br>seems it has been my lot to have fallen.<br>May he be a support to my afflicted parents<br>my dear friends, I will wait till those Revd.<br>Clergy come, and advise with them, for they<br>know best what to do in it.<br>Dear sir, I should be glad to see you and your wife, and<br>Molly before I die, it would give me much<br>pleasure: when ever you come, I suppose<br>there will be no hindrance to your seeing<br>me. You will tell Molly to send them shirts<br>to us as soon as possible, for the shirts we<br>have on are very dirty,"<p>I am,<br>your unfortunate<br>MORT COLLINS.<p>Copy of a Letter from Captain COOK.<p>Edinburgh Castle, the 30th of Octob. 1792.<p>COLLINS,<p>" I received your letter, and it<br>gives me great pleasure to find you so calm<br>and resigned in the midst of your present mis-<br>fortunes; and whatever your destiny may be,<br>I trust with the blessing of God, you will be<br>enabled to meet it with firmness and resigna-<br>tion to the divine will. I have done every<br>thing in my power for you, but cannot say<br>how my exertions will end. I hope you have<br>every possible comfort and nourishment affor-<br>ded you that your present unhappy situation<br>will admit. Put your whole trust and confi-<br>dence in the tender mercies of Almighty God,<br>and by so doing (tho' in prison) you will find<br>yourself light and easy; and be assured that<br>every happiness may attend you, is the pray-<br>er and sincere wish of"<p>W. COOK.<p>* This expression seems to be Ambiguous whom<br>he refers to.</p>
