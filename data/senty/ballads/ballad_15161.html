	<p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; TRIAL<p>and Sentence.<p> An account of the Trial and Sen-<br>tence of John Wilson and Duncan<br>Fraser, two young men belonging<br>to Edinburgh, who are to be Execu-<br>ted at Edinburgh, on Wednesday<br>the 28th, day of January, 1824.<br>for breaking into the Shop of James<br>Smyth. Taylor, St. Mary's Wynd<br>Edinburgh.<p>This day Monday Dec 22d 1823, came on before the High<br>Court of Justiciary, the trial of John Wilson and Ducan<br>Fraser, for breaking into the shop possessed by James Smyth<br>Taylor, situated in St, Mary's Wynd, by forcing out a pane<br>of glass in the window, by which they entered, and stole<br>away two new blue coloured short coats, one pair of silver<br>grey trowsers, one pair drab mole skin trowsers. one pair<br>corded jean trowsers, one green surtout, a black coat with<br>yellow gilt buttons, a boy's brown great coat, a black coat, 2<br>pairs of steel grey trowsers, and one pair of drab coloured<br>stripped Jean trowsers; on the 8th day of October last; they<br>were also proved to be both habit and repute thieves, by<br>the production of various sentences passed in the Court of<br>Police against them at former periods.<p>They pied both Guilty. The two prisoners appeared very<br>confident when they were brought into court, and by their<br>appearance seemed not to be the least intimidated : but as<br>the proceedings were going on they paid more serious atten-<br>tion.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <p>After some observations from the Public Prosecutor, a<br>verdict of guilty in terms of their own confession was brought<br>in against them.<p>The Lord Justice Clerk addressed the prisoners at consi-<br>derable length, giving them the most salutary advice as to<br>regulating their conduct for the short remaining period of<br>their lives. He then passed the awful sentence of the law;<br>which was that they are to be executed at the common place<br>of execution, head of Libertons Wynd, Edinburgh, on Wed-<br>nesday the 28th of January next.<p>The prisoners are two young men, the one seemingly about<br>18 years old, and the other 20. When sentence WAS pro-<br>nounced against them, they were very much affected, they<br>shed tears plentifully.<p>It is hoped the youth of Edinburgh, who are walking in<br>the same wicked career, commencing with small crimes,<br>which soon leads them on to greater, will take a timely<br>warning by the awful end which so soon awaits those two,<br>and the example and advice of the one who so lately suffered<br>will deter them from following a course which is sure to lead<br>them to an end untimely and shameful.<p>PRICE ONE PENNY.</p>
