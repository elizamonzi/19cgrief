	<p> The Recent Murders.<p>A NEW SONG.<p>Tune,?" Chevy  Chace."<p><br>God prosper long  our noble king,<br>Dar lives and safeties all,<br>I'll sing of murders that till now,<br>Did never yet befal.<p>In modern Athens as it's call'd.<br>In wester Portsburgh street.<br>Two murdcters had their horrid den,<br>And there did nightly meet.<p>These wretches names were Burke and Hare,<br>Both from the sister isle,<br>Their plan was to take strangers in,<br>And them of life beguile.<p>Which having done, they wrapped them up,<br>Then lsid them in a box.<br>And without either dread or fear,<br>Sold them to Dr K-----.<p>The first was Margaret Paterson,<br>Whom drink had led astray,<br>She fell into their wicked hands,<br>Who chok'd her as she lay.<p>Next on the list was daft Jamie,<br>Who laugh'd and sung sae crouse,<br>And seeking his mother was decoy'd<br>Into the murderers house.<p>Where they with whisky plied him hard,<br>Till he was nearly fu,'<br>Then Burke. engaged him instantly,<br>And Jamie down did pu'.<p>But he at last with unstrung nerves.<br>Wou'd soon have manag'd Burke,<br>Had not the fiendish Hare come in<br>And finished the work.<p>Next was a wife who came to town<br>In search of her dear son,<br>Was by those wicked wretches dogg'd,<br>And barbarously undone.<p>Last Burke had seiz'd an infant dear,<br>Oh! horrible disgrace,<br>Who while he chok'd It on his knee,<br>Did smile up in his face.<p>Such are the horrid deeds of Burke,<br>Deeds never done before,<br>Who since his sentence has confess'd<br>To twenty murders more.<p>His trusty friend, the wicked Hare,<br>Now waits alike his fate,<br>And tho' vengeance it often slow,<br>It never comes too late.<p>Now all ye powers that rule above.<br>Grant we may evil shun,<br>And that henceforth such dreadful acts<br>May never more he done !<p>Among the numerous cases which have been brought<br>to light in consequence of the recent horrible disclosures<br>in&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Edinburgh, one may be mentioned of a rather mys-<br>terious nature, which occurred some time ago in this city, <br>and which, but for these disclosures, would probably never<br>have been thought of. About four months ago an elderly<br> female procured lodgings in a house  situated in Duncan's-<br>close, High-street. The night she came to her new habi-<br>tation, she brought along with her a wheel and whisks,<br>with some other little necessary articles. She was occa-<br>sionally in the habit of retailing small wares, such as<br>tapes, threads, &c. throughout the city; and after she<br>had been three days in her lodgings, she went on an<br>excursion of this  kind, but never returned; and all in-<br>quiries that have been made regarding her have proved<br>fruitless.  It is natural to think that if she had removed<br>to other lodgings, she would have taken her effects along<br> with her; or if she had intended to have left the place,<br>she would have disposed of them; but as her wheel and<br>whisks still remain unclaimed in the house where she <br>lodged, it is the  opinion of not a few individuals who<br>have heard of the matter, that she has been made away<br>with, and appropriated to the dissecting-room----Glasgow <br>Chronicle.</p>
