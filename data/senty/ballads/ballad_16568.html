	<p> AN ACCOUNT OF THE<p>PUBLIC FLOGGING<p>Of EDWARD HAND through the Streets of Glasgow, on<br>Wednesday the 25th September, 1822, for committing a vio-<br>lent Assault on the person of a young  Girl under 12 years<br>of age, at Greenock. Also, the Judge's Address to the pri-<br>soner on passing Sentence.<p>HAND was convicted at the last Circuit Court at Glasgow, of an attempt to ra-<br>vish Mary Ann Smart,a girl of only  12 years of age, at Greenock, in July<br>last.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The case of course was gone into with closed doors, but after the examina-<br>tion of several witnesses, he was convicted on the clearest evidence.<p>Lord Meadowbank then shortly addressed the prisoner, commenting with much<br>energy on the enormity of his guilt, considering his age (above 40), and his being<br>the head of a family.  He hoped he would mend his life, and make up his peace with.<br>an offended God. Besides being for ever separated from his country, he would also'<br>have to undergo a corporal punishment, and on the 25th of this month he would<br>be taken from the Tolbooth, and whipt through the streets of this City by the hand<br> of the Common Executioner; and if every lash that was laid on his body did not<br>at one for his crime, it was hoped it would at least bring repentance. In the coun-<br>try he was going to he would be strictly looked after, and although good conduct<br>would receive its due reward, a very trifling offence would be severely punished.?<br>He was then sentenced to be whipped and afterwards transported for life.<p>Glasgow, 25th Sept.?This being the day on which he was to undergo the whip-<br>ping, about 12 o'clock a detachment of the 7th dragoons drew up before the east<br>door of the prison, a cart soon after arrived, and the prisoner was immediately<br>brought out, when the Executioner tied his hands to the cart, which was surroud-<br>ed by a numerous posse of peace officers, police officers, constable, &c., the whole<br>guarded by the dragoons. The cavalcade then proceeded to the front of the jail<br>where he received twenty lashes, which he seemed to feel very keenly; it then pro-<br>ceeded west to the foot of Stockwell where the punishment was again repeated; and<br>also  at  the  head of Stockwell, and at the Cross, making 80 stripes in all., His back<br>was much lacerated and bleeding profusely. Although the day was very wet, anim-<br>mense crowd attended; and all the windows of the shops in the streets through which<br>the cavalcade passed were shut up.<p>Hand is an Englishman, about 40 or 45 years of age, stout made, and is a glass-<br>blower to trade.<p>The crime for which the above culprit suffered, we are sorry to say is now become<br>very frequent in this country no less than three persons are to suffer the punish-<br>ment of the law at Perth in a few days?one with death, and two by public whip-<br>ping Another case at Ayr has been sent to the High Court of Justiciary at Edin-<br>burgh?the whole bringing to light a depravity of morals, and an indulgence of<br>passions of such a black and brutal, nature, that we thought existed not in any class<br>of, the community.<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Printed by John Muir, Glasgow.</p>
