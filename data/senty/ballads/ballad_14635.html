	<h2>Transcription</h2>
	<p> An account of the Trial and Sentence of John<br>Campell, and William Helm, accnsed of culpable<br>Homicide, whereby Alexr. Lawson a shearer met<br>his death at Currie.<br>John Campbell and William Helm were next brought to the bar, accussed of cul-<br>pable homicide, wickedly and recklessly attacked and laid hold of Alexander Law-<br>son' weaver, dragged him out from thence, and pushed, or with blows knocked, the<br>said Alexander Lawson to the ground with violence, whereby his skull was frac-<br>tured; and, in consequence of which, he died immediately thereafter. The prison-<br>ers pleaded not guilty.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <p>Jane Carson or Lawson, was the first witness called, and, on the Lord Justice-<br>Clerk asking, with reference to the mode of administering the oath, to what reli-<br>gious profession she belonged?if she was a Roman Catholic ??she replied with<br>peculiar emphasis, " I am a member of the Church of Scotland." Having been<br>sworn, she deponed nearly as follows :------I am widow of the deceased  Alexander<br>Lawson, who was a native of Ireland, which country he left about a year and a half<br>ago We travelled from Glasgow in search of employment, and arrived at Currie<br>about 8 o'clock on the evening of the 6th August, my husband, myself, and five<br>children. Upon reaching Currie, we went to search for a lodging house, but could<br>find none. We went to Mr Bardie's, and meeting a woman at the door, whom I<br>supposed to be the mistress of the house, I asked to be allowed to remain for the<br>night, as Edinburgh was too far distant for us to reach it. This person said, that<br>Mr Hardie was not at home ; but neither bade nor forbade us to remain. I asked<br>If we would be permitted to stop till Mr Hardie returned ? She said we might.<br>We then went into a shed?a cart shed?and sat down. About nine,  went to en-<br>quire if Mr Hardie had returned ; and was informed he had not. I returned to the<br>shed ; and my husband said there surely could be no offence taken at our remaining<br>for the night where we were. We drew a cart out of a corner; and gathered some<br> "oats" of straw that lay about, to make a bed for the children. My husband then<br>said I had better try and get some porridge or brose made for them. I went, Oh !<br>unfortunately went to the house of Campbell, and asked hs wife if she would per-<br>mit a little drop of water to be boiled ; she refused, saying her husband had to go<br>to his work in the morning, and she could not then light the fire ; I tried another<br>house, and not being able to get warm Water, returned to the shed. Our money-<br>was almost all gone; we had only one sixpence left, with which I purchased 4d!<br>worth of bread, Id- worth of sugar, and a bottle of beer, and gave them to the<br>children. We stripped ourselves naked, put the clothes under the children and our-<br>selves, along with the straw, and were covered by a pair of blankets which I had<br>with me. Just after lying down, my husband said to the two eleder children, " to<br>be mindful of their duty to their God, for the Almighty was as much with them in<br>that shed as if they had been in a palace.  Two men came into the shed, and went<br>up to the opposite corner, when they said, " they are not here" but Campbell, the<br>tall man, came over to where we were lying, and took hold of my husband's arm,<br>and Helm fastened on him immediately thereafter and dragged him from out his<br>bed, they swearing and crying at the time "you?? what brings you here?<br>My husband replied, ' Boys if there is any offence, I will rise and go away." I<br>now saw a third person who stood outside, and who afterwards prevented us getting<br>out of the shed.  The two men that laid hold of my husband , pulled him out of the<br>shed and murdered him...I heard the noise of ' slaps', By the time I got out, my<br>husband was stretched on the ground, and these two men standing beside him.<p>The deceased's daughter corroborated her mothers evidence.<br>Certificates were read, by which it appeared that both prisoners had always sus-<br>tained irreproachable characters. Both have families.<br>The Lord Advocate addressed the jury on behalf of the crown.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He would wil-<br>lingly have left this case altogether in the hands of the Court, but his duty must be<br>performed.  He would very shortly point out the nature of the crime with which<br>they stood charged.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Murder by the law, required the intention to kill to its being<br>proved ; but culpable homicide was the commission of any culpable act, by which<br>the death of a fellow creature ensued, although the perpetrator might not intend it.<br>His Lordship read a passage from Baron  Hume's commentaries, where it is laid<br>down, that if one man push another, that he fall, and death ensue in consequence,<br>it is culpable homicide, That is exactly the case, undoubtedly this poor man came<br>by. His death by the fall he sustained. By whom was he thrust down, unquestion-<br>able by the pannels, the conduct of this poor man was in no respect such as to jus-<br>tify their violence, nothing was done by this poor family to tempt  any one to do<br>them an injury, they were poor and destitute, and wandering in search of work, in<br>the course of their wanderings they came to the village of Currie, they sought a lodg-<br>ing for the night but could find none; they were told there were no lodging houses,<br>but were directed to Mr Hardies, as a compassionate gentlemen, who afforded hos-<br>pitality and shelter to unfortunate strangers. It was grevious to find this poor for-<br>lorn family so unkindly used ; they asked water, but it was refused them, yet they<br>made no complaint; they asked a little straw to make a bed for their children, but<br>it could not be given them, still they made no remonstrance,  but meekly retired to<br>their miserable lodging place without any ; when Heatly the servant refused them<br>straw, even the unfortunate father, with a meek submission which did him the high-<br>est honour, made not the smallest token of discontent, but  peaceable  retired,  and<br>scraping together such as they could find lying about,  hey  endeavoured&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to make<br>themselves as comfortable as their wretched situation afforded ; when Mr Ross, Mr<br>Hardie's nephew, sometime after found them in the shed, far from finding fault, he<br>asked them if they had got any straw, and with the feelings of a gentleman offered<br>them some ; but they humbly declined givirg tham any trouble, "surely they might<br>now think they had found a refuge, though a miserable one for the night; and they<br>stripped themselves of all their clothes, to make a bed for their poor children, and&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  <br>here a scene took place, which it was impossible to contemplate; without being more<br>affected than any public speaker would wish to be. (here his lordship and the whole<br>Court were evidently much affected.) this poor family were reduced  to the lowest<br>Poverty, they had only one sixpence in the world, which they laid out in bread for<br>their children, in this situation this poor old man not  only  strips himself for the<br>benefit of his children, but he directs them to offer up their supplications to that<br>God whose presence was with them even in this shed, and who was as able to pro-<br>tect them here as if they were in the&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;most splendid palace, from a public house<br>Campbell's wife went to bring her husband&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;home ;  and for this purpose she tells<br>a story about being insulted, and people coming into the house : Campbell did then<br>do home.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He went into his house: for  when Helm and Scott came to his house,<br>shortly afterwards, he opened the door on the inside.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He ought to have inquired<br>at his wife the particulars of the alleged insult ; but he went out with intent to in-<br>jure these poor people.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He goes from shed to shed,  and when lying in supposed<br>security, this poor man is attacked and pulled  in a state of nudity,  from his miser-<br>able shelter.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Still his peaceable disposition predominates, for he declares if he has<br>given any offence he will rise and go away : but he is answered with a blow which<br>sounds 50 or 60 yards off.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He falls and shortly dies.  Under  all these circum-<br>stances Lordship claimed a verdict of guilty in terms of the libel.<p>We regret very much that our limits will not admit of an outline, of the able and<br> affecting addresses of the judges, and the very able defence of the prisouer's counsel.<p>After a suitable admoniton from the Lord Justice lerk, the prisoners were sen-<br>tenced to seven years transportation. £7 7s was collected for the Widow.</p>
