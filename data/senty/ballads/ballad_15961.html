	<p> Ghosts, &c.!<p>-----?XXX--------<p>A True and Particular Account of the<br>Disastrous Circumstances attending the<br>Horrible and most awful Appearance of<br>a GHOST, which took place in a<br>House  in the High Street of Edin-<br>burgh, on Wednesday Evening, the<br>17th October, 1827.<p>WE hare heard and read of Brownies, Ghosts,<br>hobgoblins, &c. having done much mis-<br>chief, and caused a great deal of trouble, to the hu-<br>man race, in various parts of the world, particular-<br>ly in earlier times, though some of them are said to<br>have been very useful, and done considerableservice,<br>especially the former ; and, although they are evi-<br>dently decreasing in number in these latter times,<br>or retiring to some other more favoured parts of the<br>globe, yet we occasionally hear of their appearance,<br>and of their playing off several mischievous pranks,<br>even in populous cities, as well as in obscure country<br>places, to the great terror and annoyance of the people.<br>The following paragraph we copy from a respect-<br>.able Edinburgh Newspaper, in proof of this asser-<br>tion, which needs no comment.<p>" Ghosts.?These beings, as winter approaches,<br>are becoming excessively trublesome to the peace-<br>able burghers of the High Street. On Sunday<br>se'ennight, a mob of at least 500 persons, collected<br>at the head of Stevenlaw's Close, to witness a<br>spectre-like figure, arrayed in white, walking about<br>a room in one of the houses. Unlike other ghosts,<br>this one had a shadow, which being reflected up-<br>on a wall in the room, had a most dismal effect.<br>The mob were so penetrated with horror, that they<br>contemplated the spectre in the profoundest silence,<br>until it extinguished the candle it carried ; and they<br>withdrew.<p>On Wednesday night a still more terrific spectre<br>appealed in Mr Mitchell's house, up a com-<br>mon stair. No. 166, High Street. Some nights<br>previously it had disturbed the family by various<br>dreadful noises ; but on that particular night, only<br>the two servant-maids being at home, one of them<br>had occasion to go into a room oft" the kitchen.,<br>when she observed, gliding before her, a tali, gaunt,<br>and unearthly figure, much resembling a certain<br>lank hosier, which howled as if in the utmost ago-<br>ny, both of mind and body. Away she flew down<br>stairs, followed by her companion; and, in a pa-<br>roxysm of terror, they burst open the door of a<br>neighbour, a respectable solicitor, who was so much<br>alarmed by their distraught appearance and pierc-<br>ing cries, that he hid himself under his bed clothes.<br>From the solicitor's, they hurried to Mr Men-<br>zies's coffee room beneath, where they were kindly<br>received, and remained for the night. The whole<br>neighbourhood was thrown into commotion, in the<br>persuasion that a fire had broke cut; and families<br>were preparing to remove their furniture. One<br>individual, in particular, brought a portable fire<br>engine to the spot, which he phed up the common<br>stair with such vigour as threatened annihilation<br>both to the ghost and solicitor. The police was<br>sent for, and, as usual, a mob collected ; but no one,<br>that night, ventured to enter the haunted premises.<p>The following night they were taken possession<br>of by three stout-hearted policemen, who kept<br>watch till the morning; bur nothing occured to<br>them to excercise  their courage. We regret to learn,<br>that the health of the girl who saw the appariation<br>has been very seriously affected by the fright. The<br>unfeeling author of which, it is to bo hoped, will<br>not escape detection."?Edinburgh Weekly Chronicle,<br>Wednesday, October,24th, 1827.<p>Printed for William Walters.?Price one Penny.</p>
