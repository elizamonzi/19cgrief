	<p> A NEW SONG CALLED THE<p>BRIDGETON TRAGEDY-<p>Good people all of Glasgow, pray listen unto me,<br>Whilst I relate this woeful tale and mournful tragedy ;<br>'Tis of a fair and handsome girl, in Bridgeton she did dwell,<br>She was her parents sole delight, her comrades loved her well.<p>In May last as she walking was, one day in Glasgow Green,<br>Her charms had struck a rich young rake, her like he ne'er had seen,<br>His blandest smile he quick assumed, then kindly her addressed,<br>Alas for her, she listened so well, his suit he pressed.<p>He said he was his uncle's clerk, a merchant in the town,<br>And that the secret she must keep for fear he'd him disown,<br>But in a short time he would have some hundreds of his own,<br>And then he'd wed his lovely Jane and brave his uncle's frown.<p>Time after time that couple met, he quickly won her heart,<br>She thought he was all love & truth, so well he played his part,<br>Her artless nature knew no guile, sorry am I to tell,<br>He vowed he loved, she trusted him, and thus in trusting fell.<p>For a long time he soothed her, at length he did not come,<br>She sought the trysting place in vain, no tidings were from him,<br>The dreadful truth burst on her mind that she had been beguiled,<br>And left to face the world's cold sneer with her unborn child.<p>But one day in the Trongate his well-known form she spied,<br>Her heart beat quick, she nimbly sped, and soon was at his side;<br>She gently griped him by the arm, and faintly murmured John,<br>The cruel wretch he shak'd her off, and bade her to be gone.<p>He walk'd away, she stood transfix'd, ah, cruel was the shock,<br>The last fond shade of hope was gone", the poor girl's heart was broke<br>She staggered home, what ails you Jane, the anxious mother said,<br>Whilst pale as death, she said I'm faint, I want to go to bed.<p>To her daughter's room the mother went next morning when<br>woke.<br>Poor Jane lay weltering in her gore a blood vessel had broke;<br>The struggle was too hard to bear, her frame had given way,<br>That lovely girl, once full of life a bleeding corpse there lay.<p>In Bridgeton grave yard she now lies free from all grief and&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;pain<br>Whilst her seducer walks through life, upon his name scarce astai<br>For wealth hides vice, and gold can screen the foulness of his sin,<br>Surely his conscience cannot rest to think what he has done.<p>Now lassies all, a warning take, by Jean who died so young,<br>Destruction often lies beneath a fair deceitful tongue,<br>Poor Jane was full of life and love, and in her youthful bloom,<br>Till wealth & vice did cross her path which laid her in the tomb.</p>
