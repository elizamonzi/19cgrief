	<h2>Transcription</h2>
	<p> The last Speech confession and dying words of Colonel Despard and<br>his assocates.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  <p><br>Were brought out upon the scaffold erected on the<br>top of the New Gaol, Horsemonger-lane, to un-<br>dergo the Senteuce of  the Law.<p>Colonel Despard came the last upon the scaffold<br>He made a speech to the surrounding spectators, in<br>which he declared his innocence of the Crime for<br>which he was condemned to die His Fellow sufferers<br>said nothing, and all behaved with great dcorum,<br>and resignation to their fate.<p>After the Colonel had. made his speech he was<br>greered  by  clapping and huzzaing,  otherwise the<br>Populace behaved with the greatest  propriety.<p>Nearly about nine o'clock  the Platform dropped.<br>After hanging about half an hour they  were cut<br>down, and decaditated.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  The  whole of the  awful<br>ceremony was concluded by a quarter past ten,<br>Col. Despard was  the first who was beheaded.<br>The Soldiers were dressed in their Regimenatls<br>The vast assemblage of People who were collect-<br>ed upon the occasion, were apparently much affect-<br>ed at the scene&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and quietly dispersed.<p>Two detachments of the Horse Gurds, and one <br>of  the Scotch Grevs  were stationed in various parts<br>of  St  George's  Fields, and  about the Obelisk ; but<br>none  in  the  immediate vicinity of the Prison : as<br>no appearance of riot  was  visible, the Greys march-<br>ed back  before noon. The Reiatlves  to the unhappy<br>Sufferers at that time were waiting for there bodies<p>At Six o'clock on Sunday evening his Majesty's<br>Warrant to the  Execution  of Col.  Despard  and<br>six of his  associates, and also an order from Lord<br>Petnam, for the respite of the three others under<br>sentence of  death reached  the New Gaol in the<br>Borough As the Warrant  contained a remission of<br>part of  the Sentence of those executed this morning,<br>and may not be uninterest ng, we have here given<br>an extract from it :<p>"And whereas we have thought fit to remit part<br>of the Sentence, viz. he taking out and burning their<br>bowels before their faces and dividing the bodies of<br>Edward Marcus Despard John Wood, J. Francis<br>Thomas Broughton J Segwick, Wratten A. Graham<br>and J, Macnamara, by their being drawn and hang-<br>ed and having their head severed from their bodies<br>according to the said Sentence only at the usual<br>place of execution on Monday next the 2 st  Feb.;<br>and for so doing this shall be your Warrant. Given<br>at our Court at st Jane's the 16th day of February<br>1803 in the 43d year of our Reign. By Majestry's<br>Command.<p>(Signed)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  " Pelham.<p>" To our Trusty and well beloved Sheriff of<br>The Court of Surrey, and others whom<br>it may concern."<p>Annexed is a Copy of the Order for the Respite'<br>" I am commanded to signify to you the King's<br>Pleasure, that the execution of the Sentence of <br>Death passed upon Thomas Newman, Daniel Tyn-<br>dale and William Lander, now in the Gaol for the<br>County of surrey he respited until further significa-<br>tion of His Majestys Pleasure.<br>" I am sir, your most obedient  humble servant<br>signed&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  Pelham,<br>To our trusty, &c. &c'<p>A eight  o'clock yesterday morning Colonel<br>Despard and his fellow-prisoners were  sent  for by<br>Mr Ives to attend the Chapel. They all cheerfully<br>obeyed the summons except Col. Despard and Mac-<br>namara the former assigned no reason for his refusal<br>but the latter said he was a Roman Catholic, and it<br>would not be consistant with his faith.<p>The Rev. Mr Winckworth read prayers, after<br>which he delivered a very impressive sermon,extram-<br>ely applicable to the situation of  the prisoners. The<br>text was taken from the 18th chapter of st Luke<br>and the 13th verse, " God be merciful to me a<br>sinner. " The unhappy men joined in prayer with<br>great devotion ; and the impression made by the<br>sermon was Indicative of true fortitude, contrition<br>for their crimes and sincere repentence'<p>At  this time none of the Prisoners were apprised<br>of the warrant for their execution being received<br>It was thought best to reserve the unhappy tidingis<br>till their minds had been fortified by the Chaplains<br>discourse which had the distred effect ; for when<br>they heard the fatal information' they seemed all<br>thoroughly prepared to meet. it<p>Colonel Despard seemed more suprised than af-<br>fected. The wives of the Prisoners were premitted<br>to stay with them the greatest part of the day Not-<br>hing could be more distressing than their farewel<br>quitting the prison. Col. Despard shewed strong<br>emotions of grief on the melancholy occasion.<p>By day-light, yesterday, Mr Ives had a proper<br>number of persons employed on the top of the New<br>Gaol, to erect a platform, and as the morning ad-<br>vanced, the  neighbourhood of Horsemonger-lane<br>began to be crowded by the populace, to see the<br>scaffolding completed. Towards the middle of the<br>day the concourse was uncomonly great,<p>[Glasgow Printed by J. Galbraith </p>
