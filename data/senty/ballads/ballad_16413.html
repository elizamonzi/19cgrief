	<h2>Transcription</h2>
	<p> A&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;YANKEE&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SERMON.<p>My Beloved Brethering?I'm an unlarnt Hardshell<br>Baptist Preacher, of whom you've hearn afore, and<br>I now appear here to expound the Scripters, and<br>pint out the Narrer Way which leads from a vain<br>world to the streets of New Jaroozalum; and my tecks<br>which I shall choose for the occasion is in the leds of the<br>Bible, somewar between the Second Chronikills and the<br>last chapter of Timothytitus ; and when you find it, you'll<br>find in it these words : " And they shall gnaw a file, and<br>flee unto the mountains of Hepsidam, where the lion roar-<br>eth and the wang-doodle mourneth for his first-born."<p>Now, my brethering, as I have before told you, I am an<br>oneddicated man, and know nothing about grammar talk<br>and college highfalutin but I am a plane unlarnt preacher of<br>the Gospel, what's been foreordained, and called to prepare<br>a pervarse generashun for the day of wrath?ah ! " For they<br>shall gnaw a file, and flee unto the mountains of Hepsidam,<br>whar the lion roareth and the wang doodle mourneth for his<br>first-born."?ah!&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <p>My beloved brethering, the text says they shall gnaw a<br>file. It does not say they may, but shall. Now, there's<br>more than one kind of file. There's the hand saw file, the<br>rat-tail file, the single file, the double file and profile, but <br>the kind spoken of here isn't one of them kind naythen<br>bekase it's a figger of speech, and means going it alone and<br>getting ukered ; "for they shall gnaw a file, and flee unto<br>the mountains of Hepsidam whar the lion roareth and the<br>wang-doodle mourneth for his first-born."?ah !<p>And now, there be some here with fine clothes on thar<br>backs, brass rings on thar fingers, and lard on thar har, and<br>what goes it while they're young ; and there be others here<br>what, as long as their constitooshins and forty-cent whisky<br>last, goes it blind. Thar be sisters here what, when they<br>gets sixteen years old, cut thar tiller-ropes and goes it with<br>a rush. But I say, my dear brethering, take care you don't<br>find, when Gabriel blows his last trump, your hand's played<br>out and you've got ukered?ah ! " For they shall gnaw a<br>file, and flee unto the mountains of Hepsidam, whar the lion<br>roareth and the wang-doodle mourneth for his first-born."<p>Now, my brethering, " they shall flee unto the mountains<br>of Hepsidam," but there's more dams than Hepsidam.<br>There's Rotter-dam, Had-dam, Amster-dam, and " Don't<br>care-a-dam," the last of which, my brethering, is the worst<br>of all, and reminds me of a sirkumstans I once knowed in<br>the State of Illenoy. There was a man what built him a<br>mill on the north fork of Ager Crick, and it was a good mill<br>and ground a sight of grain ; but the man what built it was<br>a mirerable sinner and never gave anything to the church,<br>and, my dear brethering, one night there came a dreadful<br>storm of wind and rain, and the mountains of the great deep<p>was broke up, and the waters rushed down and swept that<br>man's mill dam to kingdom cum, and when he woke up he<br>found he wasn't worth a dam?ah ! For they shall gnaw a<br>file and flee unto the mountains of Hepsidam whar the lion<br>roareth and the wang-doodle mourneth for his first-born."<br>?ah!<p>I hope I don't hear anybody larfin ; do I?<p>Now, "whar the lion roareth and the wang-doodle<br>mourneth for his first-born "?ah ! This part of my tex, my<br>beseeching brethering, is not to be taken as it says. It<br>don't mean the howling wilderness whar John, the Hard"<br>shell Baptist fed on "locusts and wild asses, but it means, my<br>brethering, the city of New Y. Orleans, the spot for hard<br>bargains, where corn is wuth six bits a bushel one day. and<br>nary red the next, whar niggers are as thick as black hugs<br>in spiled bacon ham, and gamblers, thieves. and pick-<br>pockets goes skiting about the streets like weasels in a barn-<br>yard, whar honest men are scarcer than hen's teeth. and<br>whar a fellow once took in your beloved teacher, and bam-<br>boozled him out of two hundred and twenty-seven dollars<br>in the twinkling of a sheep's tail. but he can't do it again.<br>Halle'ujah?no ! " For they shall gnaw a file and flee into<br>the mountains of Hepsidam whar the lion roareth and the<br>wang-doodle mourneth for his first-born"?ah.<p>My brethering, I am the captain of that flat-boat you see<br>tied up thar. and I've got aboard of her flour, bacon, taters,<br>and as good Mononganela whisky as ever was drunk, and<br>I'm mighty apt to get a big price for them all; but what,<br>my&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;dear&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;bretbering,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;would it&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;all be wuth if I han't got<br>religion ?&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  There's nothing like religion, my baetbring ; it's<br>better nor gold or silver "simcracks ; and you ran no more<br>get to heaven without it. than a jaybird can fly without a<br>tail?ah ! Thank the Lord !&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I'm an oneddicated man, my<br>brethering,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but  I've  searched the Scripters from Dan  to<br>Beersheba,  and found Zion right side up, and hard-shell<br>religion the best kind of religion?ah!&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  'Tis not like the<br>Methodists, what spects to get to heaven by hollerin' hell-<br>fire ; nor the Universalists that get on the broad guage and<br>goes the hull hog?ah ! nor like the Yewnited Brethering,<br>that takes each other by the slack of thar breeches and hists<br>themselves&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;in ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;nor like the&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Katherliks&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;that  buys  threw<br>tickets from  thar priests; but may be likened unto a man<br>who had to cross a river?ah !?and the ferry-boat was gone<br>so he tucked up his breeches and waded across?ah ! " For<br>they shall gnaw a file and flee unto the mountains of Hep-<br>sidam whar the lion roareth and the wang-doodle mourneth<br>for his first-born."<p>Pass&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the  hat,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Brother  Flint, and  let every&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hard-shell<br>Baptist shell out.</p>
