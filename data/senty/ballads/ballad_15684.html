	<p> A&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SERIOUS<p>POEM<p>UPON<p>WILLIAM WOOD, Bra-<p>sier, Tinker, Hard-Ware-Man,<br>Coiner, Founder, and Esquire.<p>WHEN Foes are o'ercome, we preserve them<br>from Slaughter,<br>To be Hewers of Wood, and Drawers of Water:<br>Now, altho" to draw Water is not very good,<br>Yet we all should rejoice to be Hewers of Wood..<br>I own it hath often provok'd me to mutter,<br>That a Rogue so obscure should make such a Clutter:<br>But antient philosophers wisely remark,<br>That old rotten Wood will shine in the Dark.<br>The Heathens, we read, had Gods made of Wood,<br>Who could do them no Harm,if they did them no Good.<br>But this Idol Wood may do us great Evil;<br>Their Gods were of Wood, but our Wood is the Devil.<br>To cut down fine Wood  is a very bad Thing,<br>And yet we all know much Gold it will bring :<br>Then if cutting down Wood  brings Money, good Store,<br>Our Money to keep, let us cut down one more.<p>Now hear an old Tale: There antiently stood<br>(I forget in what Church) an Image of Wood;<br>Concerning this Image there went a Prediction:<br>It would burn a whole Forest; nor was it a Fiction:<br>'I was cut into Faggots, and put to the Flame,<br>To burn an old Fiaer, one Forest by Name.<br>My Tale is a wife one, if well understood;<br>Find you but the Fiaer, and I'll find the Wood,<p>I hear among Scholars there is a great Doubt<br>From what Kind of Tree this Wood was hewn out:<br>Teague made a good Fun by a Brogue in his Speech,<br>And said, By my Shoul he's the Son of a Beech :<br>Some call him a Thorn, theCurse of a Nation,<br>As Thorns were design'd to be from the Creation.<br>Some think him cut out from the poisonous Tew,<br>Beneath whose ill Shade no Plant ever grew:<br>Some say he's a Birch, a Thought very odd,<br>For none but a Dunce would come under his Rod.<br>But I'll tell you the Secret, and pray do not blab,<br>He is an old Stump cut out of a Crab:<br>And England, has put this Crab to a hard Use,<br>To cudgel our Bones, and for Drink give us Verjuice ;<p>And therefore his Witnesses justly may boast,<p>That none are more properly Knights of the Post,<p>I ne'er could endure my Talent to smother;<br>I told you one Tale, I'll tell you another:<br>A Joyner, to fasten a Saint in a Nitch,<br>Bor'd a large Auger-Hole in the Image's Breech:<br>But finding the Statue to make no Complaint,<br>He would ne'er be convinc'd it was a true Saint.<br>When the true Wood arrives, as he soon will no doubt ;<br>(For that's but a sham * Wood they carry about)<br>What Stuff  he is made on, you quickly may find,<br>If you make the same Tryal, and bore him behind:<br>I'll hold you a Groat, when you wimble his Bum,<br>He'll bellow as loud as the De'il in a Drum.<br>From me, I declare, you shall have no Denial,<br>And there can be no Harm in making a Tryal:<br>And, when to the Joy of your Hearts he has roar'd,<br>You may shew him about for a new Groaning Board.<p>Hear one Story more, and then I will stop:<br>I dreamt Wood, was told he  should die by a Drop:<br>So methought, he resolved no Liquor to taste,<br>For Fear the first Drop might as well be his Last:<br>But Dreams are like Oracles, 'tis hard to explain 'em,<br>For it prov'd that he died of a Drop at ? Kilmainham:<br>I wak'd with Delight, and not without Hope,<br>Very soon to see Wood drop down from a Rope:<br>How he, and how we at each other should grin!<br>'Tis Kindness to hold a Friend up by the Chin.<br>But soft, says the Herauld, I cannot agree :<br>For Mettal on Mettal is false Heraldry :<br>Why that may be true, yet Wood upon Wood,<br>I'll mantain with my Life, is Heraldry good.<p>* The Effigies of  Mr. Wood has been frequently carried<br>about in Procession, and burnt.<br>? Their Place of Execution.<p>Reprinted from the Dublin Copy.</p>
