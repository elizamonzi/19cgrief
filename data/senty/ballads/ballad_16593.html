	<p> SECOND EDITION<p>An account of the Behaviour and Execution of JAMES GLeN,<br>who was Executed at Glasgow on Wednesday the 12th of<br>December, 1827, for the inhumam Murder of his own Son,by<br>Drowning him in the Canal, nearPort- Duudas.<p>GLASGOW,  12th DECEMBER, 1827.<p>This day JAMES GLEN was Executed here, at the usual  place of Execution, con-<br>victed of the murder of his own natural Son&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<p>The child whom he so  inhumanly put to death, was a fine little fellow of about 18<br>months old, but  having refused to pay for its maintenance, its mother went to Glen's<br>lodginig in May last, to get some  money from him, as she was not able to maintain<br>both it and herself, but he said she might go where she came from, as she would<br>get nothing from him The mother  then said she would leave the child with him,<br>and he replied, " If she did he would droxr it in two hours,' and he but too faish-<br>fully kept his word, for  having laid the child on the floor she departed, intending to<br>return next day for  it,which she  accordingly did, but he had taken away the child<br>the same night,saying that he was going to give it to an  old  mistress to keep it, but<br>on the morning of the 9th May last the body of  a child was found in the Canal near<br>Ruchild draw bridge , and interred on the  evening of the  same  day, but it was again<br>was interring,when the  month  recognised it to  be her  child , and the Surgeons who<br>camined the body gave it as their opinion  that the child was  first strangled and<br>then thrown&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;into the Canal, where upon Glen was immediately apprehended, and up<br>on being desired to say what he had done with the child, he said that he had given<br>it to an old woman along  with 12S. whom he met  in the Cowcaddens, and that he<br>had  not seen the woman nor child since;  and from other suspicions circumatances<br>he was committed for trial.<p>While in prison awaiting his trial, the Jail was broken, and he along  with a num-<br>ber  of other prisoners made their thier escape, and L.20 reward was othered for his appre-<br>hension, but it gave himself up next day declaring he could find no rest or peaer<br>of mind.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  <p>His trial took place of Edinburgh on the 10th Nov. last and the evidence was so<br>clear that the July unanimously found  him guilty, when he did not seem at all affect-<br>-ed on hearing his final  doom pronounced.<p>Since his condemnation, he has  conducted himself with a propriety of conduct be-<br>coming his awful Situation, confessed his committing the heinous offence, and,acqui-<br>esced in the justice of his sentence.  The Rev. Dr. Muir of St. James's, the Rev.<br>Mr M'Farlane,Anderston and several other pious individuals&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;were assiduous in their<br>labours for his spiritual welfar and to whose  exhortation  he was most attentive.<p>On the present  occasion the time of execution was changed from the morning<br>till after noon,the propriety of which change must be  obvious?the intention of all<br>punishment  is?Example, and had  the execution taken place in the morning in this<br>clark and  inclement season of the year, the great end of the punishment would have<br>been frustrated comparatively few would have witnessed The melancholy scene,<br>accordingly about two o'clock the  Magistrates entered the Hall, and the prisoner<br>was immediately brought up, dressed in white, which was trimmed with black and<br>after a short stay he proceeded to the fatal scaffold, attended by some of the Rev.<br>Gentlemen who attended him in his lonely cell, where after a short time spent in<br>devotion, and the fatal noose being adjusted, he gave the signal, When the drop fell,<br>and death, closed his eyes on this world for ever,  After hanging the usual time, the<br>body was taken down placed in a shall, and conveyed to the college for dissection.<p>During the short time that the unfortunate man was in the Court Hall, he confes-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>sed that he threw his child into the canal when it was  asleep, but that he did not<br>strangle  it .&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He Said that he was under the influence of the devil at the time.<p>It not having been generally known that the execution was delayed till  the after-<br>noon, an immense multitude assembled in the morning, which continued more or<br>less till the time of execution, when it was very great.<p>Glen was a native of New kilpatrick, and was generally employed as a carter in<br>this City and neighbourhood and was only about 22 years of age.<p>This is the third instance on record of a father being executed here for the mur-<br>der  of his  child, James Day, in 1790, and Adam Cox, in 1807, were  both executed<br>for the like crimes. At one time females were frequently guilty of infanticide,but<br>since that great steeping stone to femals child murder, the "Infamous Stool of Re-<br>sentence has been comparatively abolished, the cases have greatly diminished.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;John Muir, Printer, Glasgow.</p>
