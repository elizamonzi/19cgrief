	<p> Trial and Sentence<p><p>A Full and Particular Account of the Trial and Sen-<br>tence of William M'Toague, and John M'Crevie,<br>Who are to be Executed at Glasgow on Wednesday<br>the 19th May next 1824, for Issuing Forged Notes,<br>and for Housebreaking and Theft.<p>AT Glasgow, on Wednesday the 14th April 1824, were tried<br>before the circuit of Justiciary, WILLIAM M'TEAGUE,<br>and,MARGARET M'TEAGUE, his daughter, accused of issuing,<br>in this city, forged Notes, upon different occasions. The father<br>pleaded Not Guilty, and daughter Guilty on two cases, but not<br>knowing them to be forged.<p>Mr M'Neil; after calling several witnesses, addressed the Jury<br>for the Crown, and restricted the libel, as to Margaret M'Teague,<br>as an  arbitrary punishment.<p>Mr White, counsel for the prisoners, then said, that if they found<br>William M'Teague Guilty, he hoped they would bring in a recom-<br>mendation to mercy.<p>Lord Meadowbank recapitulated the evidence, when the Jury re-<br>tired for about twelve minutes, and returned verdict, finding<br>William M'Teague Guilty of the first and third charges ; and Mar-<br>garet M'Teague of the first and second.<p>Lord Meadowbank then addressed the prisoner Margaret<br>M'Teague in a most feeling manner. He was sorry, he observed,<br>that she acted under the influence of her father. She was sentenced<br>fourteen years transportation.<p>After a few obseruations from Lord Gillies, Lord Meadowbank.<br>delivered a suitable address to William M'Teague, and sentenced<br>him to be hanged at Glasgow, on Wednesday the 19th of May next.<p> David Sharp John Cameron. John M'Crevie, Daniel M'Crevie,<br>and Margaret Bell, were indicted for housebreaking, theft, and<br>stouthrief. They were charged with having, on the night of Thurs-<br>day the 11th of December, forcibly removed the under sash of a<br>window in rhe house of James Shepherd, situated at Springvale ;<br>and having forcibly obtainsd entry, they proceeded to the apart-<br>ment in which Mr Shepherd was in bed, and did, with a poker, or<br>some other weapon, strike him one or more violent blows, and<br>threatened to murder him if he did not shut his eyes, and remain<br>quiet. Having thus obtained masterful possession of the house,<br>they feloniously carried away two mahogany knife cases, ten horn<br>spoons, two stones of cheese, a crock, with 11lbs. of butter, a jar<br>of whisky, and several other articles. Further, the prisoners, with<br>the exception of the female, were charged with having, on the 17th<br>December, broken into the cellar of Alexander Peterkin situated in<br>Weaver Street, and stolen a number of articles of wearing apparel,<br>and Margaret Bell, and John M'Crevie, were charged with resetting<br>the goods. Sharp and Cameron were outlawed for not appearing.<br>The diet, against Margaret Bell, was deserted pro loco et tempore.<br>The other two persons pleaded Not Guilty.<p>The Counsel for the Crown then proceeded to prove his case,<br>after which the Jury having been addressed by Mr M'Noill, for<br>John M'Crevie, they retired for a short time, and returned with a<br>verdict, finding the libel Not Proven, for Daniel M'Crevie, and a<br>Verdict of Guilty of the first charge as libelled, and the second<br>second charge, Guilty of theft, against the other pannel.<p>Lord Meadowbank in his address to the culprit, observed, that af-<br>ter a patient trial, in which he had been ably defended by his coun-<br>sel, he had been convicted by a most respectable Jury of the firsr<br>charge, as libelled in the indictment, and iu the second theft.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For<br>the first of these he had forfeited his life, and it was now his pain-<br>ful duty to pronounce upon him the last sentence of the law.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  He<br>must be taken back to the place from whence he came,  and did on<br>the scaffold by the hands of the executioner.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He had been found<br>Guilty of invading the house of an old man, Ling in that security<br>which is the lot of the inhabitints of this country to enjoy, and had<br>assaulted and deprived him of his property by force and violence.<br>There was no hope of pardon in his case, and he was warned to ap-<br>ply to the Almighty, whose power is infinate, and whoso goodness<br>is equal to his power.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He was then sentenced to be hanged on the<br>19th May.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The unhappy man was led from the bar protesting his<br>innocece.<p>Edinburgh, Printed, for Robert M'Millan, Prince One Penny.</p>
