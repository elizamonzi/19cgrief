	<p> THE<p>Last  SPEECH and CONFESSION<p>AND<p>DYING WORDS<p>OF<p>HELLEN&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MARISHAL<p>Who was executed at the Grass-Market of Edinburgh, upon the Thirty Day of March,<br>One thousand seven hundred and twenty,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;for the Crime of Murdering her own Child.<p>I Was Born in the Shire of Stratharn, of very Honest and Creditable Parents, who took<br>great pains for my Education; but I being Regardless of it, neglected my School,<br>and Reading, and the loss of Which Means, has made me gnorant of the Knowledge of<br>GOD and his Ways: So I being Disobedient to my Parents, and would not be in Sub-<br>jection to them, I went away from them and betook my self to Service, where having<br>been in several Services, where I served very faithfully, untill I had the Misfortune to<br>meet with the Young Man who is Father of the Deceast Child for whom I now Suf-<br>fer ; for now I Confess I never knew Man[ ] the World but him, and that only once,<br>and that he by sending out my Commerad, and none being in the House with me but<br>himself, he overpow'red me, and I for Concealing my self to be with Child, left that<br>Place, and came to this Place where I stayed till near my Delivery, and it never being<br>perceived, I engaged again in Service in Libertoun, where I really brought forth the<br>said Child, without calling for help, but did not destroy it as it was reported, for I nei-<br>ther had Knife nor no other Instrument.<p>But the actual Way I did commit this horrid Sin, was, When my Child was in the Birth,<br>I made use of my Hands for my own Saftey, and by that Means did really rive the Child's<br>Cheek; And when 1 was Delivered, seing the Child dead as I thought, and to conceal<br>this my Sin and Shame, I did hid it beneath the Boister of my Bed, but being found out<br>by my Mistress, (who used me civilly) was removed from the House, to another Place,<br>where I was Christianly taken Care of, by the Reverend Mr. Samuel Sempe Minister of<br>the Parish.<p>I am Nineteen Years of Age: And I acknowledge my Sentence to be very just. For the<br>Sin of Disobedience to my Parents, was the first Cause of my runing into other Sins, Par-<br>ticularly the unnatural Murder, for which I now justly to suffer. So I defire all Persons to take<br>Warning by me, and not to be Disobedient to their Parents, as I have been; and hot to run<br>on in a Course of Sin, as I have done. I heartily forgive all them that has wronged me,<br>as I hope to have Forgiveness from GOD Almighty, before whose Tribunal I must short-<br>ly appear.<p>EDINBURGH,  Printed at the Foot of the Horse-Wynd, 1720.</p>
