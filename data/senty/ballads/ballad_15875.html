" I never proposed to my self, that, as the end of<br>" my Travel and Labour, which neither my Circumstances or my Fortune can<br>" admitt; nor doth my mind desire: But when I see my Fellow Subjects Desti-<br>" tute of Leaders by your Cowardice, and Disposed to a most cruel Enemy, not<br>" for Slavery, but for Butcherie and  Destruction; I took pity upon their case,<br>" and have undertaken their Cause, forsaken by you ; and I will as soon leave<br>" my Life, as forsake their Liberties, Fortunes and Safety. You, to whom<br>" nasty Slavery with Security, is preferrabe to honest Liberty with hazard, Em-<br>" brace that Fortune,which you so greatly Esteem : I shall freely and willing-<br>" ly Die, tho I had a Thousand Lives, in the Defence of my Country, Nor<br>" shall the Love to my Country leave me, before my Life forsake me.
