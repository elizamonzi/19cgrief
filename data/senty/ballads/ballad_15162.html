	<p> Atrocious Case of MURDER  and THEFT.<p>A Particular Account of the Trial and Sentence of MARGARET<br>BOAG, at Edinburgh, on Monday 19th January 1824, charged<br>with Murdering Elizabeth Low, an Old Woman of  75 years of<br>age, at Dunning in Perthshire, on the 18th February, 1818;<br>or, with Theft and Reset of Theft, in stealing from her House<br>a Quantity of Webs of Linen and Sheeting, and various other<br>Articles, who was Found Guilty of Theft, and Sentenced to be<br>Transported beyond Seas for Life.<p>AT Edinburgh, yesterday, Monday the 19th January, 1824, came on before<br>the High Court of Justiciary, the Trial of MARGARET BOAG, arrainged on<br>the charges of having murdered an old woman named Elizabeth Low, or M'La-<br>red, at Dunning, Perthshire, in the month of February, 1818 ; or of theft and re-<br>set of theft, in stealing from the house of the deceased a quantity of linen in<br>Webs and sheeting, and various other articles, the property of the late Elizabeth<br>Low, and having the same unlawfully in her possession. To which the prison-<br>er pled Not Guilty. An objection to the relevancy of the indictment, with res-<br>pect to the charge of reset, stated by the prisoner's council, having been over-<br>ruled by the Court, a Jury was chosen, and the trial proceeded.<p>Dr Martin lived at Dunning in 1818; recollects the death of Elizabeth Low,<br>on the 18th February ; found her head fractured ; the body was lying on the<br>bed ; the fissure was three inches in length ; the portions of the fracture must<br>have been driven in ; the wound must have been inflicted with a blunt instru-<br>ment, because the scalp was but little changed; there was but little blood effu-<br>sed externally ; it might have been done with the blunt end of an axe ; there<br>were a number of bruises on other parts of her body; her tongue pratracted,<br>and her face exhibited a bloated appearance ; the body was cold when he was<br>called ; was there when the prisoner claimed a pair of shoes; said she lent them<br>to the deceased the night before, her feet being wet, &c.<p>Several other respectable witnesses were then examined, who described the<br>house of the deceased, the state in which the body was found when first dis-<br>covered, who lived in it at the time of the murder, and who proved several ar-<br>ticles found in the possession of the prisoner, to have been the property of the<br>deceased. The prisoner's declaration was read ; after which, five witnesses<br>were examined in exculpation, when the Lord Advocate addressed the Jury for<br>the Crown, and Mr Smith, at considerable length, for the pannel. After stating<br>the difficulty of his situation, as he could not say that the prisoner was inno-<br>cent, or that strong symptoms of suspicion did not attach to her, he mentioned,<br>that at so great a distance of time, it being now nearly six years since the mur-<br>der was committed, many persons who might at the time have brought evidence<br>to exculpate the prisoner, are now no more, and concluded with reminding the<br>jury of the peaceable character, and good name of the prisoner.<p>The Lord Justice Clerk then summed up the evidence, at great length, and<br>with his usual ability and clearness.<p>It was exactly a quarter to 11 o'clock when the Judge finished his charge, and<br>the Jury retired for 15 minutes, when the Foreman returned,....Verdict of mur-<br>der uot proven, but guilty of theft. Lord Pitmilly said, he could have no doubt<br>as to the sentence which should be pronounced. She had been acquitted of the<br>murder, and consequently of all accession to it, but no one could doubt that the<br>theft was of the most dreadful nature, aggravated by being perpetrated after as<br>foul and atrocious a murder as ever was known, and committed in the abode of<br>a murdered woman whose corpse still lay upon the ground. It amounted al-<br>most to a capital offence, and the Court would ill discharge their duty to pass a<br>milder sentence than transportation for life. Lord Meadowbank entirely con-<br>curred in the sentence, and<p>The Lord Justice Clerk, in passing judgment on the prisoner, said, she had<br>much reason to be thankful that the last sentence was not now pronounced on<br>her. It was necessary, however, that she should for ever be debarred from the<br>society of which she had shewn herself so unworthy. Her want of moral<br>feeling, and depravity of heart, made it necessary to remove her from the coun-<br>try under whose laws she had hitherto lived, to another region, where she would<br>meet many convicted of similar offences, though perhaps none more aggravated.<br>He would recommend to her, therefore, during the remainder of her existence,<br>to make her peace with that God whose law she had so fearfully violated, and<br>as she had a more awful tribunal to appear at, to prepare for it by a sincere and<br>timely repentance.<p>Edinburgh, Printed, for James Dougherty,....Price One Penny.</p>
