	<p> HARE'S&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;WIFE--Monday about mid-day this<br>miserable wretch was recognised in London Street,<br>Glasgow, near to Great Hamilton Street.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A crowd<br>of persons soon collected, and she was hooted at and pelted with stones, and pursued through several<br>streets.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She had her child in her arms, and altoge-<br>ther exhihited the most dismal picture of despair  <br>possible.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She took refuge in  several closes and  shops, but was speedily ejected, every one more than <br>another afraid to give her the least protection, so great was teh violence and infuriated disportition of the<br>mob. Weavers and their wives were each moreeager<br>than the other to show their hatred and detes-<br>tation to this unfortunate being.  At last the Cal-<br>ton Police arrived, and she was, under their pro-<br>tection, conveyed to the Calton Police Office. Had<br>not the officers come to her assistance, there is no<br>saying what might hare been the consequences, as<br>the crowd evinced the most wanton disposition to<br>abuse her.she must have received several bruises,<br>as teh stones were flying at her in all directions. <br>Since she left Edinburgh jail, with her infant child,<br>she has been wandering the country incog. She<br>states that she has lodged in this neighbourhood four<br>nights, with her infant and " her bit duds,"<br>without those with whom she lodged knowing who<br>she was, and she was in hopes of quitting this vicini-<br>ty without detection. For this purpose she remain- <br>ed in her lodgings all day, but occasionally early in <br>the morning or at twilight she ventured the length<br>of the Broomielaw in hopes of finding a vessel ready&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>to sail to Ireland, but she has hitherto been disap-<br>ointed.  She went out on Monday morning on the same object, and when returning, a woman, who she<br>says was drunk, recognised her in Clyde Street, and<br>repeatedly shouted " Hare's wife--Burke her," and<br>threw a large stone at her, when a crowd soon ga-<br>thered. She says she wrought 10 years ago in Tu-<br>reen Street power loom factory, till she was married<br>to her first husband, a decent man, " who feared God:<br>and the ways of godliness," and she was the hap-<br>piest woman with him till he died. She had eight <br>children to him. About three years ago, she un-<br>fortunately fell in with Hare, and then commenced<br>her misery.' She married him, and has since had'<br>three children, one of whom is dead, and another is<br>left behind in Edinburgh. Hare's habits were de-<br>voted to "the devil and laziness," and she never<br>had comfort with him. She admitted it was need-<br>less to deny she knew "something" of the murders,<br>and had a suspicion of what was going on, but not<br>to the full extent, as she was a good while badly.<br>She often upbraided  Hare, her husband, for his <br>atrocities, and said, that though he might conceal<br>his deeds from the eyes of man, God would discover<br>them, for the shedder of innocent blood never es-<br>caped. At this reproach he called her by the most<br>horrid names, and beat and kicked her shockingly.<br>She had indeed a miserable time of it. Hare was<br>often drunk; their house was a complete " hell of<br>iniquity;" and she was often on the point of expos-<br>ing his hidden conduct, but was afraid to do so. She<br>left his house three times, on account of his brutal<br>usage. She says she would much rather be killed<br>outright than suffer what she had done, as an out-<br>cast from society, during the last fortnight. She<br>did not require to beg, having had a little money,<br>but she had now scarcely as much as pay her passage<br>to Ireland. She was quite ignorant of what had be-<br>come of her husband since she left Edinburgh ; she<br>asked if he had been subsequently tried, and it was<br>news to her to be told he was liberated, and by the<br>Dumfries. She expressed the utmost indifference<br>respecting his fate, and said she was determined<br>never more to associate with him.  In leass than an hour after<br>she was lodged  in the Police Office,a post chaise <br>drove rapidly up to the private door, leading to the<br>office from Struthers Street, into which she was put,<br>and followed by Mr Nish from the Sheriff's Cham-<br>bers, and in less than five minutes afterwards the<br>chaise was out of sight. It is believed she expected<br>to meet her husband at the house of the notorious<br>Broggan, who is now said to be about Calton.  She<br>had a copy of  Burke's Confession in her pocket,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; which she had  purchased on the street for a half-<br>penny, and upon which she freely commented. Had<br>she  been allowed  to remain  in&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Carton  till night,<br>when all the mills stopped, there is reason to fear<br>that the wretch would have received summary chas-<br>lisement, as the crowd was fast increasing,  and be-<br>gan to talk of Burking her, or throwing her into<br>Clyde.  She is now, we believe, out of the country,<br>and on her passage to Ireland--Glasgow paper.<p>On Wednesday, one of the hands belonging to the<br>St Rollox schooner, a London trader, was drowned<br>in the Forth and Clyde Canal, in the neighbour- <br>hood of Auchinsterry. His body has not yet been<br>found. He belonged to the neighbourhood of Kin-<br>cardine, and has left a widow and one child<p>LINES<p>SUPPOSED TO  HAVE  BEEN&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;WRITTEN -BY<p>MRS WILSON,<p>Daft Jamie's Mother,<p>On ascertaining the Way and Manner her son had<br>been basely Murdered in the&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  est Port, by<p>WILLIAM BURKE,and WILLIAM HARE.<p>O my son, why did you wander,<br>Why so far away from home ;<br>If was love to me, your mother,<br>Caused you so far to roam.<p>You was simple, inoffensive,<br>Loved by all where e'er you went,<br>And their little bonaties cheer'd you,<br>And their smiles made you content.<p>When you met your neighbour cronies,<br>Take or give a snuff would ye,<br>With your box and spoon sae happy,<br>To prime their noses aye so free.<p>But, O ill ill fated morning,<br>that you saught your mother dear,<br>Wandering through the Grassmarket,<br>Without either dread or fear.<p>But, cruel monsters, they had eyed you,<br>And had marked you for their prey ;<br>To their horrid den decoyed you,<br>And with whisky paved the way.<p>O, my heart, how does it shudder,<br>At the deeds confessed and done,<br>That have been committed by them,<br>Monsters in the human form.<p>Who could for the love of money<br>Turn the  living into dead,<br>and thus prepare for the dissector,<br>Subjects to supply his need,<p>Love of money,--root of evil,--<br>Cause of all the murders done,<br>And other crimes more horrid<br>Than the murder of my son.<p>Eneouraged by those that bought them,<br>Still to bring them plenty more ;<br>Never questioned how they got them,<br>Though their hands were stained in gore.<p>You who bought and used his body,<br>Surely you was much to blame,<br>In concealing thus a murder,<br>For you must have known the same.<p>If your conscience had allowed you,<br>But for once the truth to tell,<br>But the craft had been in danger,<br>Had you stopped these imps of Hell.<p>Blood guilty wretches though concealed,<br>For a time your crimes have been,<br>Justice has you overtaken,<br>And your guilt must all be seen.<p>But justice still demands that you<br>Of your crimes should make confession,<br>Before you on a gibbet high<br>To the law make restitution.<p>May your repentance be sincere,<br>And your crimes be all forgiven,<br>All your guilt be cancell'd here,<br>And at last be found in Heaven !<p>Is the prayer of, &c.<br>Price One Penny.</p>
