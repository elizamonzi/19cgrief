	<p> A LETTER to the Author of the National Journal. <p>S I R,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<p>IN all the Lists of the Prisoners taken in or after the Battle of Culloden, I observe,<br>That none of those taken were wounded.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now, as in every Battle there are a<br>great many wounded, and left in the Field of Battle a Prey to the Conquerors, who<br>generally take as much Care of their wounded Enemies, as of their own wounded<br>Men, I wish you would inform me what became of the Rebels------that were left<br>wounded in that Field at that Battle.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  I am, Your's,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  TOM. CURIOUS.<p>SIR,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To the Author of the National Journal.<p>AS your Correspondent Mr. Curious observes, there are People wounded in all<br>Battles. There were some at Dettingen, Fontenoy, Prestonpans and Falkirk ; and<br>we know that all the Care imaginable was taken, even by their Enemies, of those that<br>were wounded in each of these Battles. But in the Battle of Culloden, if the wounded<br>Rebels were all knocked o' the Head, it was no more than they deserved; for they,<br>and, I think, their Children, and the Children of all Jacobites, ought to be served so,<br>because, if they are suffered to live, many of them, in all Likelyhood, will grow up to<br>be Rebels------If we had in our Hands none of the Accomplices of these Traitors, their<br>might have been Policy in saving some of them for publick Executions, in order to<br>strike Terror, and prevent any Sort of Rebellion for the future; but we have enough<br>for that Purpose.<p>I also think, that all Jacobite Women, who are not past the Age of Breeding, should<br>be------, because there is no Doubt but many of them will breed Jacobites, as Chil-<br>dren generally suck in the Principles of their Mothers and Nurses, which can never be<br>eradicated but by great Posts and Pensions, and this, you know, is often a great Dis-<br>appointment as well as Loss to us honest People.<p>I am also of Opinion, that all the Corn in Scotland, designed for Seed, as well as all<br>the Cattle, ought to have been seized, and all Implements of Husbandry destroyed,<br>except what belongs to the few that are known to be well affected, which would in-<br>fallibly starve all those rebellious Wretches in a Year or two------This would effectually<br>extirpate them, and save us the Expence of transporting them to our Colonies, where<br>they may do great Mischief by infecting the People with their Principles.<p>As we have had very little Intelligence from Scotland since the Battle of Culloden, I<br>do not know if this Method has been folbwed; but I am clear in Opinion, that it<br>ought to have been followed ; and you may be assured, that many great, wife, and<br>powerful Men are of the same Opinion ; therefore I hope you will publish these my<br>Thoughts in your next Paper, which will oblige,<p>Sir, Yours,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A true Modern WHIG .<p>P. S. If you publish this, I expect some good Place, in Reward for my Zeal, and<br>I intend to appoint you my Deputy.<p>A List of the Noblemen, Gentlemen, and others, attainted for their Accession to the Rebellion.<br>A Lexander Earl of  Kellie ; William Viscount of Strathallan ; Alexander Lord Pit-<br>A sligo ; David Wemyss Esq; commonly called Lord Elcho, Eldest Son and Heir ap-<br>parent of James Earl of  Wemyss;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;James Drummond&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Esq;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Eldest Son and Heir<br>apparent of William Viscount of Strathallan; Simon Fraser Esq; Eldest Son and Heir ap-<br>parent of Simon Lord Lovat ; George Murray Esq; commonly called Lord George Mur-<br>ray,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Brother to James Duke of Athol ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lewis Gordon Esq;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;commonly called Lord<br>Lewis Gordon,  Brother to Cosmo George Duke of Gordon ;  James Drummond,<br>taking upon himself the Title of Duke of Perth ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;James Graham, late of  Druntroon,<br>taking on himself the Title of Viscount of Dundee ; John Nairn, taking upon himself the<br>Title or Stile of Lord Nairn; David Ogilvie,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;taking upon himself the Title of Lord<br>Ogilvie;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;John Drummond,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;taking upon himself the Stile  or Titl of Lord John<br>Drummond,  Brother to James Drummond,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;taking on himSelf the Title of Duke of<br> Perth ; Robert Mercer Esq; otherways Nairn, of Aldie; Sir William Gordon of Park ;<br>John Murray of Broughton, Esq; John Gordon the Elder of Glenbucket ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Donald<br>Cameron the Younger of  Lochiel;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Doctor Archibald Cameron,  Brother to Donald<br>Cameron the Younger of Lochiel;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ludovick Cameron  of  Tor-Castle;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alexander<br>Cameron of  Dungallon; Donald MacDonald of  Clanronald,  Junior, Son to Ronald<br>MacDonald of Clanronald ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Donald MacDonald of  Lochgarie ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alexander Mac-<br>Donald of Keppoch ; Archibald MacDonald, Son of Colonel MacDonald of Barisdale;<br>Alexander MacDonald of Glencoe ;  Evan MacPherson of  Clunie ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lauchlan Mac-<br>Lauchlan of  Castle-Lauchlan ;  John MacKinnon of MacKinnon ; Charles Stewart<br>of Ardsheil; George Lockhart, Eldest Son and Heir apparent of George Lockhart of<br>Carnwath; Lawrence Oliphant the Elder of Gask; Lawrence Oliphant the Younger<br>of Gask ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;James Graham the Younger of Airth; John Stewart,  commonly called John<br>Roy Stewart;  Francis Farquharson of  Monalterye; Alexander MacGilivrae of Dru-<br>maglafli, Lauchlan MacIntosh Merchant at Inverness;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Malcolm Ross, Son of Alex-<br>ander Rose of  Pitcalny;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alexander MacLeod,  Son to Master John MacLeod Ad-<br>vocate; John Hay, Portioner of Restalrig,  Writer to the Signet ; Andrew Lumsdale,<br>otherways Lumsdain, Son to William Lumsdale, other ways Lumsdain, Writer in Edin-<br>burgh ; and William Fidler, Clerk in the Auditor's Office-in the Exchequer of  Scotland.</p>
