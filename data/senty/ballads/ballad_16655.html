	<h2>Transcription</h2>
	<p> A particular Account of a most horrid Instance of  Child<br>murder, attended with Circumstances of the greatest Bar<br>barity, which was discovered at Thorney Bank  on Wed-<br>nesday last, when Catharine Weir,  alias M'Quarry, the<br>Mother, was apprehended and committed to the Tolbooth<br>of Glasgow on suspicion of having&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;perpetrated the Murder.<p>WE understand, by different accounts from Thorney<br>Bank, that the mother of the unfortunate infant<br>went there a few days ago in order to be delivered, as she<br>was acquainted with some people about the place,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;having<br>formerly been enployed about the bleachfield there.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  <p>It appears she did not stay long at Thorney Bank after<br>her delivery, but left the place rather abruptly. Whether<br>the woman in whose house she was delivered Knew any<br>thing about the inhuman transaction, we do not know, but<br>in that respect there are various reports, which would not<br>be proper to state at present. We hear her name is M'Far-<br>lane, and that she is  a woman of fair character.<p>As far as we could learn, none of the neighbours had the<br>smallest suspicion of the child having been murdered; there-<br>fore, no inquiry took place about her - and while they were<br>engaged at their business, as few working people have much<br>time to spare at present. She went off, but every person that<br>heard of her departure imagined that she had taken the in-<br>fant along with her.<p>But on  wednesday morning, the 6th instant, us a boy<br>belonging to Thorney Bank was diverting himself at the<br>side of a ditch, not far from the house where the child was<br>born, he observed the bleachfield watch-dog, snorting and<br>scraping up the earth in a furious manner, as if in search<br>of some animal that had burrowed there.<p>Prompted by curiosity, the boy hastened to the spot,<br>when he discovered the head of an infant.<p>Terrified at the sight, the little fellow called the dog,<br>run off, and immediately alarmed the neighbourhood, when<br>the child was taken up in a state, it is said, too shocking to<br>mention.<p>Notwithstanding the horrid appearance of the child when<br>taken out of the hole, into which ,it is said to, have been<br>put entirely, bent together, without a covering of any kind,<br>it is not yet known in what manner it has been put to death,<br>or whither the mother is the only person concerned in the<br>hapless fate of the little innocent.<p>We understand the body of the child was washed, cover-<br>ed, put into a coffin, and conveyed to Glasgow, and that<br>the mother on examination, was so strongly suspected of<br>having been guilty of the shocking and detestable<br>deed, that she has been fully committad to the jail of this<br>city, in order to be tried for the offence  at the next Circuit<br>Court of Justiciary.<p>It is truly lamentable to observe, the number of women<br>that have been lately tried, and banished from different<br>places of Scotland, for child-murder, and still the inhu-<br>man crime is committed. Go you unfeeling mothers and<br>learn humanity from the brute creation.<p>T. Duncan, Printer, saltmaret.</p>
