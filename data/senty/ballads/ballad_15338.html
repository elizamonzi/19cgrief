	<p> Narrow Escape of a Gen-<br>tleman from MURDER.<p>A strange and comical account of Three Gentlemen who<br>left Edinburgh, and sailed in the ECLIPSE Steam<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Packet for Belfast. and having large sums of money in<br>in their possession, they proposed to sleep in one room ;<br>when scarcely asleep, one of them imagined he saw a man,<br>and gave the alarm to the other two, and slipt out of bed<br>to seize him ; his companions taking him for the Robber,<br>laid hold of a chair and nearly deprived him of life, until<br>the landlord entered with a candle, and found him wel-<br>tering in his blood?Taken from yesterday's  Ed',nburgh<br>Star.'&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  <p>  A  ludicrous incident,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;which was  nigh leading  to a fatal<br>result, occurred at a respectable hotel in Belfast, on Saturday week.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Three Scottish gentlemen, whose names we forbear men-<br>tioning, having arrived in the ECLIPSE Steam Packet, put<br>up at the hotel.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They had a considerable sum of money in<br>their posession, and for their better security, they proposed<br>to sleep together in one room, and were accordingly accom-<br>modated with a threr-bedded one.  Some time after they had<br>retired, while imagination was  perhaps, conjuring up dire-<br>ful tales of blood-thirsty robbers and midnight assassinations,<br>one of the watchful trio suddenly exclaimed,  'I see a man !'<br>This annunciation was instantly followed  by the gentleman<br>starting  up,  in order to&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;secure the door,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and prevent the<br>escape of the robber:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;while,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;cautiously slipping out from<br>the curtains, he was espied by one of his terror-struck com-<br>panions, who, thinking he was the robber,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;quickly sprang<br>sprang forward,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;seized a chair,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and attacked him with des-<br>perate fury.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The third individual also joined in the attack,<br>and the&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;consequence was  likely to be&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;dreadful.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  At  this<br>moment, the noise having aroused the landlord and some of<br>his servants, they flew towards  the bed-room,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and forced<br>the door.<p>A light being introduced, the reader may judge the aston-<br>ishment of the parties, when it was discovered that the sup-<br>posed BLOODY ROBBER was no other than their own<br>companion, who lay speechless , covered with wounds, and<br>weltering in his blood ! Surgical aid was immediately<br>procured, and the unfortunate Caledonian, who had been<br>dreadfully wounded, is now in a fair way of recovery.<p>Some idea may be formed of the violence inflicted on<br>him, when we mention that the chair, a strong mahogany<br>one, was literally dashed to pieces in the conflict.<p>Also, an Account of a DREADFUL RIOT which took<br>place at Maghera, in Ireland , on Thursday last, 12th June,<br>berween the Orangemen and Ribbandmen, with the num-<br>ber of the, killed and wounded on both sides.<p>(From a Belfast Paper.)<p>We are sorry to have to state, that on Thursday last, the<br>12th instant, at the fair of Maghera, Dorry, disturbances<br>originating in party spirit broke out to an alarming degree.<p>About six o'clock in the evening, an immense number of<br>Ribbandmen assembled int he town, and proceeded to attack<br>a house in which an Orange Lodge meets, and broke the<br>windows, &c. A small party of the 77th regiment, consist-<br>ing of an ensign, sergeant, and Eleven men, stationed at<br>Maghera, were called upon by the Rev. Mr Colthurst to<br>quell the Riot, but were obliged to retire to the barracks.<br>A second time were the soldiers called out, and a second<br>time forced to retire. The Orangemem at last, assisted by<br>a party of Yeomanry, drove the Ribbandmen out of town.<p>The Ribbandmen suffered severely ; nine were killed,<br>and between sixty and seventy wounded. One Orangeman<br>was killed, and  several of that party severely wounded .</p>
