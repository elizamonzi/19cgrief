	<p> An excellent new Play-House Song;<br>called, the bonny Gray-ey'd<br>Morn;<br>OR,<br>Jockie  rouz'd with Love.<p>To an excellent new Tune.<p>The bonny Gray-ey'd Morn began for to peep<br>when Jockie rouz'd with Love came blithly on;<br>And I who wishing lay depriv'd of sleep, <br>abhor'd the lazy Hours that flow did run.<br>But meikle were my Joy's when in my View<br>I from the Window spy'd my only Dear ;<br>I took the Wings of Love and to him flew,<br>for I had fancy'd all my Heaven was there.<p>Upon my Bosom Jockie laid his Head,<br>and sighing told me pretty Tales of Love<br>My yielding Heart, at every Word he said,<br>did flutter up and down,and strangely move;<br>He sighing, kiss'd my hand,and vow'd and swore,<br>that I had o'er his Heart a Conquest gain'd.<br>Then blushing begg'd,that I would grant him more<br>which he alas! too soon, too soon obtain'd. <p>Nor that I do repent, I did comply;<br>but this I needs must own, my yielding Heart<br>Was quickly overcome by Jockie's Eye,<br>which gave a deeper wound than Cupids dart,<br>His Cheeks were Cherry red, his Lips the same,<br>his Tongue so many Charms could still express:<br>That every word he said did raise new Flames,<br>and kindled, kindled Fire in my Breast.<p><br>My Jockie does a thousand ways beside,<br>express himself in tender Love to me:<br>With Arms about my waste, he sighing cry'd,<br>oh give me thy Consent or I must die,<br>Then with a gentle Kiss doth beg again,<br>that his poor wounded Heart I would but cure,<br>Nor thinking that I felt his Love-sick Pain,<br>for alas! 'twas his, 'twas his before.<p>And now! I could no longer hide my Pain,<br>but let my dearest Jockie know my Heart.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>Oh, how he hugg'd me in his Arms again!<br>and ev'ry Kiss he gave did ease my Smart ;<br>Then vowing o'er and o'er betwixt each Kiss,<br>he constant would remain while Life did last ;<br>Now tell me Lovers; where's the Hurt of this,<br>for to enjoy, when that the Knot's ty'd fast?<p>FINIS.</p>
