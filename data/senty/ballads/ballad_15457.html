	<p> Respite<p>OF<p>James Wemyss.<p>Edinburgh,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Monday, April 6, 1840.<p>This unhappy man, who was to have been<br>executed this morning, has received a respite<br>of his fatal sentence ior the period ten days.<br>Yesterday morning, at 4 o'clock, a despatch<br>from the Secretary of State was received at<br>the Post Office, addressed to the Governor<br>of the Jail, Mr Rose, to whom it was im-<br>mediately forwarded; and who, upon break-<br>ing the seal, found an enclosure addressed<br>to the Lord Provost, which contained the<br>respite, and which was promptly sent to his<br>Lordship by a special messenger. Between<br>nine and ten o'clock the Lord Provost, ac-<br>companied by the Rev. Mr Syme of Old<br>Greyfriars, came to the Jail, when his Lord-<br>ship, in presence of that gentleman and Mr<br>Rose, communicated the gracious purport of<br>the despatch to Wemyss. The unfortunate<br>convict, who has behaved with becoming<br>propriety since his condemnation, received<br>the news with great calmness and sobriety,<br>and did not seem in any way excited, but<br>apoeared to be thankful, on the ground,<br>that, whatever might be the future result,<br>the respite would allow him more time to<br>acquire knowledge, and to prepare himself<br>for the appalling change before him.<p>We understand that a petition in favour<br>of Wemyss, which was forwarded immedi-<br>ately after the trial, met with a decided<br>negative, and that the ground of tne present<br>respite was another petition, which was sign-<br>ed by most of the jurymen, and forwarded<br>to the Secretary of State on Monday last.<br>This petition prayed for delay, in order to<br>allow time for enquiry into certain particu-<br>lars winch hcd come to l.ght since the trial,<br>teoding to shew thut Wemyss's wife, who<br>was killed, had, by long habits of intemper-<br>ance, debilitated her constitution, and in-<br>duced a diseased condition of the brain, so<br>ss to make her liable to fatal 'njury from a<br>comparatively slight cause; and the affray<br>in whico she met her death, though fatal in<br>its consequences, ought perhaps to be regard-<br>ed rather as a drunken brawl, in which both<br>parties were blameable, than a deliberate act<br>of murder.<p>The statement which appeared in two<br>Edinburgh papers on Saturday, that the jury<br>had petitioned for a commutation of sen-<br>tence, we now understand was incorrect, the<br>petition merely praying for delay and farther<br>enquiry, in the mean time, which, as already<br>mentioned, the Secretary of State had fouud<br>himself at liberty to advise her Majesty to<br>grant.<p>We alse learn that a letter to the Judges<br>who presided at the trial of Wemyss, em-<br>bodying the view of the case above stated,<br>and earnestly entreating their Lordships'<br>favourable consideration of the case,  in the<br>event of a farther enquiry being allowed, has<br>also been presented, signed by several  re-<br>spectable inhabitants of Edinburgh.<p>Sanderson, Printer, Edinburgh.</p>
