	<p> The mantle so Green.<p>As I was walking one morning in june.<br>To view the gay fields and meadows in bloom,<br>I espied a young female, she appeared like a queen,<br>With costly fine robes, and a mantle so green.<p>I stood in amaze and gazed with surprise,<br>I thought she was an angel who had fallen from the skies<br>Her cyes shone like diamonds, her cheeks like roses,<br>She is one of the fairest that nature composes.<p>Said I, lovely fair one, if you will agree,<br>We will join in wedlock, and married we will be;<br>I'll dress you in rich attire, you'll appear like a queen,<br>With costly fine robes round your mantle so green.<p>She quickly made answer--you must me excnse,<br>For I'll wed with no man, so you must be refused;<br>To the green woods I'll wander, to shun all men's view,<br>For the lad that I loved was at famed Waterloo.<p>Then since you will not marry, tell me your lover's name,<br>For I have been in battle, and might know the same ;<br>Draw near to my garment and then will be seen.<br>His name is embroidered on my mantle so green.<p>In the raising of her mantle, its there he did beheld.<br>His name and his surname in letters of gold ;<br>Young William O'reilly appeared to my view,<br>He was my chief commander at famed Waterloo.<p>We fought so victorious when bullets did fly,<br>In the field of honour your true love he did die;<br>He fought for three days, until the third afternoon,<br>When he received his death-wound on the 18th of June.<p>When he was dying I heard his last sigh.<br>Were you here, lovely Nancy, contented I would die;<br>Peace is proclaimed, now the truth I declare,<br>Here is your lover's token, the gold ring I wear.<p>The longer she viewed it the paler she grow,<br>She flew into his arms, with a heart full of woe ;<br>To the green woods I'll wander, for the boy that I love,<br>Rise up, lovely Nancy, your grief I'll remove.<p>Nancy, lovely Nancy. I have won your heart,<br>In your father's garden the day we did part;<br>In your father's garden under a tree shady and green,<br>When I rolled you in my arms, in your mantle so green<p>This couple got married, I heard people say,<br>They had nobles attending on their wedding day ;<br>Peace is proclaimed, and the war is all o'er,<br>you are welcome to my arms Nancy, for evermore.</p>
