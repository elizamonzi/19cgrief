	<p> The Pardon Came Too Late<p>YOU CANT PUT AN  OLD HEAD  ON THE SHOULDERS OF A CHILD<p>Just&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;like  the&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ivy&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I'll&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cling&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You<p>SHE WAS  BRED IN OLD KENTUCKY<p>The Pardon Came Too Late.<p>A fair-haired boy in a foreign land at sunrise was to die;<br>In a prison cell he sat alone, from his heart there came a sigh;<br>Deserted from the ranks, they  said, the reason none could say<br>They only knew the orders were that he should die next day;<br>And as the hours glided by, a messenger on wings did fly,<br>To save this boy from such a fate?a pardon, but it came too<br>late.<p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  CHORUS-<p>The volley was fired at sunrise, just after break of day,<br>And while the echoes lingered, a soul had passed away,<br>Into the arms of his Maker, and there to hear his fate;<br>A tear, a sigh, a sad good-bye?the pardon came too late.<p>And round the camp fire burning bright, the story then was<br>told,<br>How his mother on a dying bed called for her son so bold ;<br>He hastened to obey her wish, was captured on the way;<br>She never saw her boy so fair?he died at break of day;<br>And when the truth at last was known, his innocence was at<br>once shown,<br>To save from such an unjust fate a pardon sent, but 'twas<br>too late.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Chorus.<p>She was bred in Old Kentucky.<br>As a lad I stood one day by a cottage far away,<br>And to me that day all nature seemed more grand,<br>For my  Sue with blushes red had just promised we should wed,<br>And I'd come to ask her mother for her hand;<br>As I told the old tale, of love that ne'er would fail,<br>The grey-haired mother stroked her daughter's head,<br>And I-fancied I could trace just a tear on her kind face,<br>As she placed my sweetheart's hand in mine and said?<p>CHORUS?<p>She was bred in old Kentucky where the summer skies are blue,<br>There's the sunshine of the country in her face and manner too.<br>She was bred in old Kentucky, take her lad, you're mighty<br>lucky,<br>When you marry  a girl like Sue.<p>Many years have passed away since that well-remembered day<br>When to that dear old Kentucky home I came;<br>And my happiness through life was my sweetheart, friend,<br>and wife,<br>For the sunshine in her heart remained the same.<br>I am sitting all alone in the place we long called our home,<br>For yesterday my darling passed away,<br>And I think with tears of joy of the day when but a boy,<br>When I took her hand and head her mother say?<p>CHORUS?<p>She was bred in old Kentucky where the summer skies are blue,<br>There's the sunshine of the country in her face and manner too.<br>She was bred in old Kentucky, take her lad, you're mighty<br>lucky ,<br>When you marry a girl like Sue.<p>You can't put an Old  Head on<br>Young Shoulders.<p>To spare the rod will spoil the child, I've often heard people<br>say,<br>But with such sayings I will ne'er give in;<br>To ill-use or abuse a child, everyone must own,<br>Is not the way a child's respecte to win.<br>Advice goes further than a blow, so when they do what's wrong<br>speak kindly to them, don't fly in a rage<br>But show to them their error,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;you'll find when they<br>grow up,<br>They'll love and honour you in your old age.<p>CHORUS?<p>Treat them with kindness, don't cause them pain,<br>Don't let passion master you, be lenient with the cane;<br>For children will be children, and remember though they're<br>wild,<br>That you cannot put an old head on the shoulders of a child.<br>Young blythesome things, their presence brings sunshine to<br>our homes,<br>And awakens in our hearts fond memories dear,<br>They take us back to bygone days when we were young our-<br>selves,<br>And  recall to mind  old  scenes  we  now  revere.<br>Cold indeed must be the heart that does not love a child,<br>Shame on them who would them cruelly beat,<br>They surely  can't remember that they once were young them-<br>Or their little offsprings they would ne'er ill-treat.<br>selves,<p>Just like the Ivy I'll cling to you<p>Written and composed by A. J. Mills and<br>Harry Castling. Sung by Marie Kendall.<br>Music at Francis, Day & Hunter's, 142 Char-<br>ing Cross Road, London, W.C.<p>Grand-dad sat at evenfall<p>'Neath the dear old garden wall,<br>Where the ivy  was clinging all around;<br>And  a maiden, young and fair,<br>With blue eyes and golden hair.<br>Was nestling there beside him on the ground.<br>"Some day you'll be leaving me<br>For a sweetheart," the old man sighed?<br>"Some day he forgetting me; "<br>But with a smile the maid replied?<p>CHORUS?<p>"Just watch the ivy on that old garden wall,<br>Onnging so tightly, whate'er may befall;<br>As you grow older I'll be constant and true,<br>And, just like the ivy, I'll cling to you,."<p>"When the ivy, years ago"?<br>Said the maid?"began to grow,<br>Then the old wall supported it with pride;<br>Now the old wall's in decay,<br>And is crumbling fast away,<br>The ivy clings more tightly to its side.<br>Loving you have ever been-<br>You have cared for me day by day;<br>Loving I shall ever be,<br>And always by your side I'll stay."<p>Copies can: always be had at the Poets'  Box,  Overgate, Dundee.</p>
