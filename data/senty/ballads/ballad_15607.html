	<h2>Transcription</h2>
	<p> LETTER<p><p>F R O M&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A<p>Gentleman in England to his Friend<br>in Scotland, concerning the Reports<br>upon Colonel Charters.<p>Am perswaded, That the World is turn'd up side<br>down, and Lies or false Reports more Credited than<br>Truth. I could not but a little strange at your last<br>Letter concerning States Affairs. That His Majesty<br>was so afraid for the pretender, that He was forc'd<br>to go to Hanover; with many more Rediculous<br>Stories. It seems your News-Mongers, and Bussie<br>Bodies for want of Foreign News, raised idle Stories<br>and Calumnies at Home, and by their idle Practice spread them Abroad;<br>So that they become a Laughing to us of another Nation, to think that<br>the Generality in Scotland should be so foolish to believe every idle Story<br>that perhaps they may hear out of a drunken Fellow's Pate.<p>It was an Admiration to me, when ye wrote about a great Comet Star, that <br>should been seen, on the Fifteen of March; and that the Pope had sent an Ac-<br>count of it to all the Christian Kings, that it would destroy all Christendom.<br>And I wonder how any Judicious Person can credit such Romances.<p>I am perswaded, 'Tis Nothing that raises such, but a Conventicle of old<br>Wives, telling over their Dreams to each other, and some accidental Person<br>over-hearing .it, not knowing it a Dream; takes it for News, and so it runs<br>through like a Rattle-bag.<p>Ye also wrote concerning Colonel Charters, how he had met with a Spi-<br>rit, which should so affrighted him, that he could get no Rest nor Quiet, with<br>an awakned Conscience, and that the Spirit told him, He was to die, and the<br>Day of the Month when he should die; and that his Lady was forced to leave<br>New-mills for his Screeches and Cries.<p>Sir, I had not well read your Letter, when Business called me Abroad,<br>where I was met by Colonel Francis Charter s, walking upon the Streets,<br>as well in Health as ever I saw him, and as Merry and Jocal as ever he was<br>in his Life, I thought his Lady had good Ears, to hear from Newmills to<br>Chattingcross her Husband's Screeches. But I really strange Who can take<br>it upon their Conscience to invent such calumnious Fictions.<p>And it surprizes me, what can occasion his own Country People so much<br>to Vilipend that Gentleman ; For I have observed; he never came to Lon-<br>don, but I heard most clandestine Reproaches raised upon him by his own<br>Country. For I remember some Years ago, of a hidious Story relating to the<br>said Gentleman, which they inserted in the Scots Currant, as groundless and<br>false as this late One. But if Colonel Charters had prosecute the Raisers of<br>the first Calumny, it perhaps might have scar'd others from such Practices in<br>Time coming.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <p>S I R,<p>London March&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am your most humble Servant,<p>23. 1718.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <p><br>EDINBURGH, Re-printed in the Year 1718.</p>
