	<p> Trials, &c.<p>A Full  and Very Particular account of the Trials of the different<br>Persons who stood their Trials before the Special Commission,<br>which opened at Paisley, on Tuesday the 1st of August, 1820.<p>The Lords Commissioners appointed by the Special Com-<br>mission of Oyer and Terminer, for Trying all Treasons and<br>Misprisions of Treasons, committed within the counties of Stir-<br>ling, Lanark, Dumbarton  Renfrew, and Ayr, opened their<br>proceedings here on Tuesday morning. The following were<br>the Lords .Commissioners.?The Lord President of the Court of<br>Session, the Lord Justice Clerk, the Lord Chief Baron of the<br>Court of Exchequer, the Lord Chief Commissioner of the Jury<br>Court, and Lord Pitmilly. John Hulleck, Esq. Serjeant at<br>Law, assisted at the trials, and Mr. Thomas George Knapp,<br>Clerk in the Arraigns of the Home Circuit in England, acted<br>as Clerk to the Commissioners.<p>On the part of the Crown the Counsel were the Lord Adve-<br>cate, the Solisitor-General, Mr. Hullock, Mr. H. H. Drum-<br>mond, and Mr. Hope, the Lord Advocate's Deputes, Mr. Men-<br>zies, Mr. Knapp?and Mr. James Arnot, W. S.Agent.On<br>the opposite slde of the table sat, Mr. J. A. Murray, Mr. Gra-<br>ham. Mr. Monteith, Mr. Pyper, Mr. Cullen, Mr. Miller, and<br>Mr. Sandford, Advocates; and Mr. Harmer, the English Bar-<br>rister, who, we believe, conducted the trials which lately took<br>place at Manchester.?Agent, Mr. Fleming.<p>The Court met for business in George Street Church,<br>and was opened about nine o'clock, and in a few min-<br>utes was crowded with people, who engerly pushed into<br>the Court Hall for the purpose of hearing the trials. The<br>Lord President addressed the Court; after which<p>JAMES SPIERS, weaver, in Johstone, and ROBERT<br>LANG, weaver, Kilbarchan, were brought into Court. The pri-<br>soners  were brought from the Jail to the Church in a coach,<br>escorted by a party of Hussars, and entered under a charge of<br>two Police Officers. SPIERS was first put to the bar.<p>The Clerk of the Crown then read over the list of the petit<br>Jury, which consisted of the following Gentlemen:?<p>Sir M. Shaw Stewart, of Greenock and Blackhall, Bart.<br>Foreman,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>Alan Ker, of Greenock, merchant,<br>John M'Naught, of Glen Park, near Greenock,<br>Robert Hunter, of,Kirk Street, Gteenock,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  <br>James Coats, of Paisley, manufacturer,<br>Matthew Roger, of Ropland,<br>Alexander Lelper, of Paisley, merchant,<br>Gavin Browning, of Paisley, merchant,<br>David Trail, of Paisley, dyer,<br>John Gibson, of Paisley, cotton yarn merchant,<br>Thomas Wright, of Paisley, perfumer,<br>James Wilson, of Palsley, silk merchant.<p>The indictment having been read over, charging him with<br>being chosen and acted as a member of a committee who com-<br>manded a mob which went and stopped the cotton works at<br>Johnston and neighbourhood, on the 3d of April. To this in-<br>dictment Spiers pleaded Not Guilty.<p> As Robert Lang was summoned as an evidence against the<br>prisoner, Mr, Grant objected to his being in Court, and he was<br>tahen out of Court. John Frazer, who had been confined four<br>months on a similar charge to that of the prisoner, gave evi-<br>dence on the part of the Crown and was set at liberty. The<br>evidence on the part of the Crown closed at half-past twelve<br>O'clock, and the Court adjourned till next morning.<p>WEDNESDAY.?Eleven witnesses were examined on be-<br>haif of the prisoner; and their evidence went generally to show<br> that Spiers, although present at the meeting on the School-<br>green at Kilbarchan, on the 3d April last, took no particular<br>charge of the business, neither did he make a speech, &c.<p>Mr. J. P. Grant; the Lord Advocate, and the Lord Justice<br>Clerk, severally delivered their opinions on the case at great<br>length. The Jury retired about a quarter before four o'clock<br>in the morning, and at half past five came into Court with a<br>verdict, finding him Guilty on the 15th over-act of the first<br>count, but this not being considered the regular mode of re-<br>tnrning the finding, they were ordered to retire and return a<br>special verdict, but they twice returned into Court with the<br>same verdict. They were then addressed by the Lord Chief<br>Baron, and they retired for the fourth lime; but immediately<br>returned with a verdict of Not Guilty, and the audience in gene-<br>ral commenced cheering.<p>The huzzaing commenced by the crowd out of doors the<br>moment the cheering commenced in the Church, and the Sheriff<br>was ordered to go out and take means to preserve the peace.<p>The Lord Justice Clerk, in an impressive speech, dismissed<br>him from the bar.-Spiers served several years as lance-serjeant<br>of the 26th Regiment of Foot, but left the service owing to a<br>pain in his breast.<p>JOHN LANG was then put to the bar?the Jury found him,<br>Not  Guilty, and after a suitable admonition from the Lord<br>Justice Clerk, he was dismissed from the bar; and the Court<br>adjourned till the 1st of December.<p>An immense crowd surrounded Mr. Grant and Mr. Sandford<br>on their leaving the Court, and accompanied them to their lod-<br>gings. The multitude, amounted to about 10,000<p>The Court meats at Stirling to-morrow (Friday) August 4.<p>GLASGOW, PRINTED BY JOHN MUIR.</p>
