'tis my intention,<br>To tie him to a tree,<br>Or else to bribe the pressgang,<br>On the banks of sweet Dundee,<p>The pressgang came to William,<br>When he was all alone,<br>He boldly fought for liberty,<br>But there were three to one,<br>The blood did flow in torrents,<br>Come kill me now said he,<br>I would rather die for Mary,<br>On the banks of sweet Dundee<p>This maid was one day walking,<br>Lamenting for her love,<br>She met the wealthy squire,<br>Down in her uncle's grove,<br>He put his arms around her,<p>SMELL! SMELL!<p>HIS BREATH!<p>E'er the tea party it had begun,<br>I eat an onion?only one,<br>Folks held their noses seemed ill at ease.<br>Stirred to and fro, made remarks like<br>these?<p>Just smell his breath, do smell his breath,<br>Just take one  sniff, if you wish for<br>sudden death,<br>Then in a rage, one big fellow cried,<br>Here's  a cake, for heaven's  sake, go<br>outside,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[breath I<br>And change your breath, and change your<br>Fain would I linger yet must be gone,<br>Leaving those custards all alone,<br>Sadly I find my way to the door,<br>Loud beats my heart as the&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;shoe-<br>blacks roar.?<p>Just smell his breath, do smell his breath<br>One little sniff is enough to cause sud-<br>den death,<br>Folks made a rush for the other side,<br>Hurrying, scurrying, this they cried,<br>Do change your breath, oh! change your<br>breath!<p>BANKS OF DUNDEE. [CONTINUED]<p>Stand off! base man, said she,<br>You sent the only lad I love,<br>From the banks of sweet Dundee.<p>He clasped his arms around her,<br>And tried to throw her down,<br>Two pistols and a sword she spied,<br>Beneath his morning gown,<br>Young Mary took the weapons,<br>His sword he used so free,<br>But she did fire and shot the squire,<br>On the banks of sweet Dundee.<p>Her uncle overheard the noise,<br>He hastened to the ground.<br>Since you have killed the squire,<br>I'll give you your death wound,<br>Stand off, then said young Mary,<br>Undaunted I will be,<br>The trigger she drew and her uncle slew,<br>On the banks of sweet Dundee.<p>The doctor soon was sent for,<br>A man of noted skill.<br>Likewise came his lawyer.<br>For him to make his will,<br>He willed his gold to Mary,<br>Who fought so manfully,<br>And now she lives quite happy,<br>On the banks of sweet Dundee.</p>
