	<p> MURDER<p>A Full, True, and Particular account<br>of that cold bloody and diabolical murder<br>committed on the body of Mr M 'Nab's<br>Post Boy, Innkeeper and Post Master in<br>Cupar of Fife who was barbarously mur-<br>dered a few yards from his Masters house<br>on Thursday last.<p>To add to the attrocities which has been lately<br>committed in this part of the country, we have the<br>painful duty to record another, apparently less pro-<br>voked then those which have lately taken place.<br>We extract the following article from the Courant<br>Newspaper, the authenticity of which there is no<br>grounds to doubt.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.<p>Early on Thursday last, a post boy in the em-<br>ployment of Mr M'Nab, inn. keeper,Cupar-of.Fife.<br>was found murdered a few doors from the Inn.<br>The scull was fractured, and the face much disfi-<br>cured, apparently from the effects of blows.<p>A precognition was taken by the Sheriff, but<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; as yet no discovery has been made of the perpetra-<br>tor of the diabolical deed.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <p>Although by the above account there is no ment<br>tion of robbery having been intended or committed,<br>yet it is but reasonable, to surmise that no villain<br>could be so wretchedly lost to feeling as to perpe.<br>trate&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;such  a&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;deed  without&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;having&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;some selfish<br>motive to satiate.  Yet true it is that some monster<br>possessed of that unrelentless and reckless brutul<br>feeling which governs the minds of some hardened<br>villains, may have, through wantonness or revange<br>taken the life of  the individual eluded to.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is to.<br>be hoped, however, that this, like most other mur-<br>ders, will be brought to light, and the perpetrator<br>brought to that iribunal where he will meet with<br>the punishment he so richly deserves.<p>EXTRAORDINARY CIRCUMSTANCE.-----A few days<br>ago, a  traveller went into an inn at Aberdeen.<br>where he intended to sleep all night and proceed<br>on his jurney in the morning. Before going to.<br>bed, he laid a pair of pistols on his bedroom table,<br>remarking to the landlord of the inn that the pis.<br> tols were loaded, and that, it would be dangerous<br>for any person to tutch them.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  <p>In the morning, when the traveller awoke, he<br>went to the stable to look after his horse and found<br>that  it hadcast a shoe.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He went to a smith's shop<br>to get it shed, which was done ; he discoverd<br>that one of his pistols wanted a screw, and requested<br>the smith to put one in its place, intimeting to him<br>at the same time that it was loaded. Vulcan put the<br>barrel of the pistol to his mouth and blew into it,<br>observing that it was not  loaded.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The traveller<br>on examining it  and the other pistol, found that<br>the shot had been extracted. Suspecting that some<br>conapiracy was intended, he again loaded the pis-<br>tols, and proceeded on his journey.<p>On arriving at a thick set wood a few miles from<br>town, two men came towards him, carrying blud.<br>geons in their  hands and demanded his purse. He<br>immediately fired one of the pistols over their<br>heads to intimidate them, but the robbers being<br>still  intent upon their felonious purpose, he shot<br>one of them dead upon the spot.<p>It can be easily surmised, and with safely, that<br>the landlord of the house had some concorn in the<br>intended robbery.<p>FORBES & Co: Printers;171, Cowgate.</p>
