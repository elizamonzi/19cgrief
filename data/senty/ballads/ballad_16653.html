	<p> The last SPEECH, Confession, and dying Words, of<br>the Bogs, who were burnt in the Pleasance. on Monday<br>the 25th of May, 1767. For the horrid Crime of<br>Blood-sucking  A FARCE.<p>HOW do you think your works will after thrive?<br>What cruelly to burn us all alive ?<br>Had we been Porcupines, I mean Hedge-hogs,<br>Our stobs might hurt you ; but we're only Bogs;<br>We little room took from you, we are sure,<br>In corner of your drawers slept secure :<br>The sucking of your blood was all our crime;<br>No tales we told, nor spoke one word in time.<br>The king himself cannot drive us from him,<br>For in St James's we are very common;<br>Because, as Snakes, we still creep out at night;<br>And oft destroyed by the candle light.<br>You know we are not capable of treason,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  <p>Destroy us ! that's void of sense and reason.<br>Our honest land-lord, whose house we possest,<br>Laments us not, 'cause we disturb'd his rest.<p>Tho' we were innocent of all the strife,<br>Occasion'd by the landlord and his wife;<br>No advocates we had our cause to plead :<br>Seek no revenge for us, since we are dead.<br>Unhappy was the day this man was born,<br>The rich despise him, now the public scorn.<p>But why was we destroy'd on his account,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; '<br>our crimes to his could never sure amount;<br>Had he been mild, and in his nature calm,<br>We ne'er had been committed to this flame.<br>But oh! alas! we can get no redress,<br>We here must suffer, tho' our crimes Be left.<br>This multitude on as would have no pity,<br>So here we leave our blood upon the city;<br>But we exist not; this ends all our pain,<br>And greater punishment he must sustain.<br>The wicked crowd, who saw us thus destroy'd,<br>Look'd careless on and not the least annoy'd.<br>Altho' our house was burn'd about our ears,<br>None to assist us in the least appears:<br>O cruel land-lord, by the crowd thus scorn'd,<br>The costly furniture your house adorn'd,<p>No more in your apartment now appears,<br>Tho' all Was new within these seven years.<br>These is not one your quarrel will excuse,<br>Although the whole is in the public news<br>It sure Was shocking to behold the splutter;<br>Think on the fate of the well tasted butter,<br>Which an honest man there thought to've preserv'd<br>But by the mob redic'lously was serv'd ;<br>They took it from him, thrust it in the flame,<br>Happy for him his fate was not the same;<br>The butter in a moment took the blaze,<br>The man elcap'd, because he had more days.<br>Think. O thou cruel landlord of our fate,<br>We hope you ne'er will go so gray a-gate.</p>
