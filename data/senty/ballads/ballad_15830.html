'las whither are we hurl'd ?<br>What universall madnesse shakes the world ?<br>What is all space so empty, earth must come,<br>And mount aloft to fill a Vacuum?<br>Are our eares charm'd, that now all sounds displease,<br>But a Scotch Bag-pipe? 'las what dayes are these!<br>Walsey might be a Deacon, and here con<br>A farther lesson of Ambition ;<br>Nay, Machiavel, if he were now alive,<br>Would he but change Religion, might thrive ;<br>Religion ! 'las it is a crazie frame,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  <br>And somewhat like the Synod, onely name,<br>Which like the great Megores renowned sway,<br>The most are pleas'd to mention, none obey,<br>Which like some glorious City ruined long,<br>Do's onely live in Paper and the Tongue.<p>Religion, which a blind man well might call&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>Immense, but one that's dease, not finde at all,<br>That which the world doth generally disguise,<br>That stamp by which all knavery currant is;<br>Art thou thy selfe, great Nymph? or else doe some<br>Deflowre thee, nay force thee away from home,<br>And make thee doe their drudgery? O spleen,<br>Couldst thou but rise as some lungs strerch'd ha been,<br>Thou mightst boil out more hot,then ere one brother<br>Could to pronounce damnation on another.<p>Erected snakes, could but my anger now<br>So farre degenerate as stoope to you,<br>How could I thrash you and abuse you worse,<br>Then you your selves can a rich Poet curse,<br>Worse then you censure Usurers, when you look<br>On the lanke reckonings of an Easter Booke:<br>Alas, how could I daube you, worse then ere<br>Hicks did his English Concordance besmeare;<br>Or a hot Monke couId with mouth-engines work<br>Strange executions against the Turke?<br>But Ille be still, a Country Maior can soon<br>Quaffe all these vapours of Religion;<br>What? quaffe them say you ; yes, they cannot be<br>Surcharg'd with too much Schoole-Divinitie;<br>They doe not feed on Fathers,them they hate,<br>Both as a hard and undigested meat;<br>Nay, those that know them, intimately say,<br>They cannot Conjure by the Kabbala:<br>Nay, most oth' Patriarkes would be to seek,<br>To tell their new confession in Greek;<br>But they who want all weapons, will not strike,<br>But each prove a Rhetoricall Vandike,<br>Worse then the running o'th'raines, which sence<br>Tells onely evill in the consequence;<br>But this will be when th'King their Sermons heares,<br>When Lesly reads, and Pryn regains his eares,<br>When Edwards, that destroying Amurath,<br>His Inquisitionary Swords shall sheath<br>That puny Hercules, who siercely sweats,<br>To slay the Monsters he himselfe begets;<br>The English Cadmus, whose most conquering pen<br>Sowes Dragons teeth to raise up armed men,<br>Who like the Maid to the great Victor sent,<br>Makes poyson now become his nourishment,<br>Who lest the growing Sectaries should not live,<br>Beats them like Walnut Trees to make them thrive,<br>That Church Lycurgus, who to slop the sinnes<br>Of waste and drunkennesse, cut down the Vines,<br>That venerable sonne of fury, that<br>Makes modesly quite excommunicate,<br>Which in the Classick Ordinance must come in,<br>As numbered  for the six and thirtieth sinne,<br>By him you know the Brotherhood, this one<br>In time may make a Brotherhood alone:<br>But they are Planets that at distance run,<br>And Vines lookes like the picture of the Sun.<p>FINIS.<p>Printed in the Yeare 16[  ]</p>
