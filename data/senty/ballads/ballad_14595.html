	<p> DREADFUL<p>WARNING<br>To PARENTS.<p>WE find that the solemn vows and promises are of so great weight, and strictly<br>binding by the severe notice God has taken of those that have violated<br>them, in punishing the dishonour done to his name, by various and fearful judgments;<br>and the dismal death this young woman died in consequence of breaking her solemn<br>vow to the man who adored her, furnishes another striking example of the heinousness<br>of the crime.<p>It appears that James Thomson, son of a gentieman in Stirling, had but a made-<br>rate fortune, but was a very accomplished and handsome young man?that, some<br>time ago, while riding towards this town, he, by accident, saw the lovely Miss<br>Stewart, standing near her father's house, and instantly fell in love with her.<p>The beautiful maid on perceiving his eyes were earnestly fixed on her blushed, and<br>modestly retired, not less captivated with his elegant person and manly looks. They<br>spoke not to each other, yet both felt, at the same instant, the powerful effects of mu-<br>tual love. He rode on to dispatch his business, and as soon as he had finished it, his<br>whole thoughts were ingrossed by what means he would devise to get himself intro-<br>duced to the innocent maid who fully possessed his heart unknown to herself.<p>But love, who was not idle, soon gave him an opportunity to exert his skill; for<br>Miss Stewart was in as bad a condition as himself, and took sick a few days after she<br>saw him, to the great grief of her parents, who intended to have had her soon marri-<br>ed to a rich neighbouring gentleman named Pearson, Physicians were called in, but<br>could do nothing for her, and she daily grew worse. At length young Thomson,<br>hearing how things were going on, lost no time in disguising himself like a medical<br>gentleman, rode off to her father's house, and offered his services. He was courte-<br>ously received, and speedily introduced to his darling's presence; and, as he was<br>seated, he requested every person to leave the room ; in order that he might converse<br>slowly with her, as she was very low, and, if possible, to find out her disordeir and<br>prescribe accordingly which was immediately complied with.<p>The love-sick maid had no sooner fixed her eyes on him than she knew him, and<br>fetching a deep sigh, she fainted away ! But he revived her with some cordials that<br>he brought; so that recovering her senses, her blushes overcame her paleness, and<br>made a very visible alteration in her countenance for the better. In short, the lovers<br>soon understood each other so well, that she rapidly recovered, to the great joy of<br>her grieved parents, who did not know how to recompence this wonderful doctor suf-<br>ficiently, having no notion of the medicine that so completely effected their darling's<br>cure. The old gentleman offered him a purse of money, which he refused, saying,<br>he only wished to visit the family in a friendly way. Her father thanked him, and<br>requested his company to dinner that day week. Young Thomson, who thought<br>the day would never arrive, punctually attended in the same disguise, was kindly re-<br>ceived, and had the inexpressible pleasure of seeing his lovely patient more blooming<br>than ever. After dinner, he took an opportunity of walking with her in the garden,<br>where, after a turn or two, sitting down in a pleasant shady bower, they began to<br>talk of love, and of the day he first visited the family, devouring each other, as it<br>were, with their eager looks?kissing, and using all the modest freedoms that lovers,<br>whose hearts were so united and enflamed, could wish or desire ; and after some in-<br>terrupted sighs, he clasped his arms about her snowy neck?' Ah ! lovely Eliza,'<br>cried he, ' How blessed am I to have this opportunity to tell you how dearly I love<br>you; your are the only jewel in nature that I prize, and could I but be possessed of<br>you, I should think myself the happiest of all mankind.' At this, turning her eyes<br>with modesty on him, she said, ' That since he had been so kind as come so timely<br>and save her life, she would recompence him in any lawful way he could desire; for,<br>though she was courted by a gentleman named Pearson, and whom, she believed,<br>her parents wished her to marry, yet she was by no means prepossessed in his favour.'<br>Upon this encouragement, he pressed her further, and vowing eternal love and con-<br>stancy, she not only .gave her consent to a speedy mariage, but told him, happen<br>what would, her heart was his?on which, overjoyed with rapture, they returned to<br>the house. When Thomson was taking leave of the family, Mr Stewart invited him<br>to a public entertainment that was to be at his house the third day following, which<br>he accepted, and for that time parted. It appears this first was made to entertain<br>Pearson, who was exceedingly fond of Eliza, and her father, who wished to have<br>them married. The day arrived, and the rival lovers met each other at the enter-<br>tainment, during which Miss Stewart's partiality for Thomson was so evident that<br>Pearson could not contain himself?he rose hastily from the table and departed.?<br>The old farmer and his wife were astonished, and could not account for so sudden an<br>alteration. An explanation took place, when Pearson told what he discovered.<br>This increased their astonishment; they took their daughter into a room, and told<br>her what Pearson had-suggested ; when she said, 'Since Thomson has saved my<br>life, I shall be his wife.' Thomson entering just as she had finished, owned his love,<br>and asked the father's consent to marry Eliza, which the old farmer refused; and<br>while Thomson was reproaching him for his ingratitude, Pearson, who heard what<br>had passed, rushed in with a drawn sword, and made a push at Thomson, but he<br>nimbly put it aside, and drawing, wounded him in the breast. Thomson immediate-<br>ly fled. In a short time afterwards, Eliza found means to have an interview with<br>him, when they vowed nothing but death would part them. With tears and kisses<br>they parted, promising to write to each other?But, alas ! she was detected on her<br>return home, confined to her chamber, closely watched, and all her lover's letters<br>intercepted. She bore her confinement with fortitude, but lost all hopes of being<br>united with Thomson. Pearson had now full liberty to visit her when he pleased,<br>and did every thing in his power to render himself agreeable, while her parents daily<br>pressed her to give him her hand?the cautious maid at last turned to her parents",<br>and said, ' My loving parents, I never yet disobeyed, but take care you do not ruin<br>your daughter?I can give my hand?It is out of my power to give my heart.' The<br>old couple were now happy, and thought their daughter would soon be the<br>same?but mark the consequence, and let all parents profit by it?she was shortly<br>afterwards married?she grew melancholy, and would not be comforted. The mar<br>riage was heard of by Thomson, he could not stand the shock, and in a fit of in-<br>sanity, he hung himself on a tree, and Eliza being the first that discovered him, she<br>elapsed him in her arms and immediately expired.<p>EDINBURGH:?PRINTED FOR JAMES TAYLOR.</p>
