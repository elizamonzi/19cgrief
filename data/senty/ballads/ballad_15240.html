	<p> Hare's Confession & Death !<p>Awful Death and Confession of HARE, the notorious associate of<br>Burke, the West Port murderer, who died in the parish of Orrey,<br>County of Tyrone, on Saturday, the 29th May, 1841.<p>We have been favoured with a letter from Captain Murray, who<br>was a witness of the wretched man's awful end.?The letter com-<br>mences by stating that Hare has lived under the fictitious name of<br>M'Guigan, in an obscure village in the parish of Orrey, since he left<br>Scotland, immediately after the deeds of darkness in Edinburgh.<br>He never was suspected to be the wretch that he felt himself to be,<br>and, therefore, dragged out a miserable existence in obscurity and<br>poverty.<p>In a miserable hut he lived on the coarsest fare, which soon<br>brought on a loathsome disease, vermin and seeds of corruption,<br>the fruits of a debased and dissolute life, brought this unhappy<br>wretch, whose life has been marked by deeds the most atrocious<br>ever known, to meet a death more awful than any of the poor crea-<br>tures whom he ushered into the presence of their Maker, without a<br>moment to present a prayer to an offended God, for his gracious<br>promise of forgiveness, through their Saviour, to the guilty soul.<p>Writhing under the tortures of an awakening conscience, and the<br>awfully fearful death of an unearthly punished murderer, this no-<br>torious associate of Burke made the following disclosures before he<br>closed his eyes on mortality :?He was born in the neighbourhood<br>of Londonderry, and received a decent education. He came to Scot-<br>land to work at the Union Canal. He was in the custom of going<br>to the country with a horse and cart, having crockery, for which he<br>took old iron, and sold it to the dealers in Edinburgh and the sur-<br>rounding country. A few years before he was apprehended along<br>with Burke, he connected himself with her whom he called his wife,<br>who had just become the widow of a tall Irishman of the name of<br>Log, who kept a stall in the Grassmarket, and had taken her oft the<br>streets of Glasgow, which she infested as a prostitute. Shortly<br>after Log's death, and the commencement of her connexion with<br>Hare, she bore a child, which people in the neighbourhood assert<br>(and upon very strong grounds) that she murdered ; and that there<br>would be no difficulty in establishing the case against her. It was<br>at an appothecary's shop in the southside of Edinburgh that Burke<br>first met the gentleman whom he af.erwards supplied with subjects.<br>So ignorant were Hare and he at first, of the proper quarter in<br>which to offer a ' new-made ' subject for sale, that when they had<br>one they went about among some surgeon-apothecaries' trying to<br>dispose of it. After his many perilous adventures in Scotland, con-<br>sequent upon the horrid scenes which were enacted in Edinburgh,<br>Hare made his escape to Ireland. On reaching his native country,<br>the generous minded sons of the Emerald Isle seemed as much en-<br>raged, if not more so, than the people of Scotland. The murderer<br>had to fly from hamlet to hamlet, from village to village, and from<br>town to town, and had the people been actually sure of his real<br>character, there is not the smallest question that he would have<br>died without mercy by the hands of the mob. The manner in which<br>his character was discovered at his death, was providential, having<br>been taken suddenly ill of his last sickness, on the road some miles<br>distant from his own cabin, he was found by two labouring men,<br>lying almost at the point of death, who humanely carried him to<br>the nearest cottage, where they put him to bed, little suspecting the<br>infamous character they had taken into their house to breathe his<br>last, he was asked his name which he said was M'Guigan ; but the<br>truth could not long be concealed. The surgeon was sent for, who im-<br>mediately perceived the tide of life was fast ebbing, which the wretch-<br>ed man was no sooner apprized of, when the awful foreboding and hor-<br>rid suspicions of a guilty conscience took possession of the murder-<br>er, and he rolled about on his miserable couch like one surrounded<br>by a thousand furies. The image of his companion in crime haunt-<br>ed him in his sleep?he would start from his bed and exclaim in<br>agony?" Burke ! Burke ! the scaffold, I see it! I see it!" and then<br>the groans which succeeded are too horrific to describe.<p>But before the closing scene came, confession had to be made;<br>and the surgeon who attended him was made the repository of a ca-<br>talogue that would harrow the feelings of a region of cannibals. Not<br>only the Westport murders, but other deeds of as dark a stamp had<br>been perpetrated by the wretched man. From the apparently paltry<br>act of theft committed in his childhood, to the more manly act of<br>burglary, he had risen gradually in the scale of wickedness, till he<br>appeared as a witness at Edinburgh, for the condemnation of his bro-<br>ther in iniquity. But it was only by " fits and starts" that the mur-<br>derer could reveal the secrets of his tortured breast. After Hare had<br>made his confession, he appeared more tranquil, and expired at two<br>o'clock in the morning, and his last look seemed to say with the force<br>of inspiration " woe to the murderer." Next morning an immense<br>crowd collected to view the remains of the unfortunate wretch, but<br>they were very properly prohibited by the Police from gratifying<br>their curiosity. His body was buried by the Police in the afternoon<br>as privately as possible. Such are the particulars of the death of<br>Hare, who is now beyond that " bourne from which no traveller<br>returns,"&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  [G. Whitelaw, Printer.</p>
