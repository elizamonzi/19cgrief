	<p> LIFE AND DEATH OF THE OLD<p>Woman of Ratcliffe Highway.<p>This is to let you understand that an old woman of Ratcliffe<br>Highway, was drowned in a heavy shower of feathers last night,<br>6 weeks ago. I went in search of her as fast as I could run sit-<br>ting down by the side of a ditch, until I met John Jarvis a coach-<br>man, driving 6 dead horses under an empty post chaise laden with<br>6 miliners, 4 tambour workers, 2 milestones, and a sheet anchor<br>for a 74. I asked him if he could tell me about this old woman,<br>he said he could not, but John Manks could tell me all about her.<br>I asked him where he lived, he told me he lived beyond all parts<br>of the 3 flying jackasses, where the cock never crows, the wind<br>never blow, or old Tom Fox never blew his bugle-horn on the<br>top of a high hill down in a low hallow, in a short 4 square round<br>house, standing all alone by itself, and only 60 or 70 houses ad-<br>joining to it. When I received this information. I set off as fast<br>as 4 could run sitting down every minute to rest myself, until I<br>met an old man very had with the horn cholic in his big toe, the<br>headache in his belly, and the [  ]vel in the back of the neck<br>I called for a coach, drov&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;him "to an apothecarys' shop  called<br>for 5 pints of pigeon's milk and 4 quarts of eels beastings, and<br>had it boiled in a leathern wooden iron pot, and gave it to him.<br>then conveyed him to the lock hospital, where he was put to bed,<br>and safely delivered of a blacksmith s anvil, 2 tons and a half<br>weight, with 9 grenadier fleas, fully acontred with a pair of pistols<br>a blunderbuss and 18 rounds of ball cartridges, was supposed to<br>be on the march to St Helena, to bring Bonaparte home on the<br>87th day of the hungriest month in the year 1800 and boiled<br>milk. At length I arrived at John Mank's house but was very<br>much surprised I could hear or see no one but was talking to them<br>all; saw John coming out of a vinegar bottle, so well be might<br>for he was a bottle maker to trade. I asked him if he could tell<br>me about this old woman ; he told  me he could not ; but he wrote<br>a letter to her to-morrw night ere yesterday, 7 years ago, when he<br>was fast asleep and his eye open : he new her father well he was<br>smith and farrier to a pack of grey-hounds, and her mother was<br>sucklar to a young pig for Lady Doall in Shovcover street. where<br>they sell turkey cock's eggs tor buttermilk  and where pigs play<br>cards for stirabout. When I received this information. I was<br>going to take my farewell of him when he told me I should not<br>go until I should see some of his wonders; the first great wonder<br>he showed me was six of the oldest daughte s spinning 6 hanks<br>of yarn each out of charcoal ; the next was little boys and 6 little<br>girls playing hide and seek under a hay cock made of stones ; the<br>next was he and his eldest son thrashing tobacco into peas one of<br>the peas jumped through a stone that was 6 feet thick, and killed<br>a dead dog that was lying on the other side, the dog jumped up<br>and began to bark. I jumped over the wall so well I might for<br>it was only the height of a cabbage stock, but that ca bage stock<br>was not much higher then Neilson's Monument in Glasgow. I<br>turned the dog inside out and he jumped after a hair that was fol-<br>lowed by 6 bog-trotters, and 4 pensioners, that lost their heads,<br>legs, and arms at the battle of Waterloo, and I thinking to my-<br>self that I could run as fast as any of them I clapped my two shin<br>bones in my pocket and followed them over hill and dale with the<br>hue and cry in my mouth until I came to the Currach of Kildare<br>where I saw the Belfast Mail Coach and the Londonderry steamer<br>engaged in a dreadful battle, firing boiling hot stirabout and<br>roasted potatoes at each other, one of potatoes struck the hare<br>over the right eye when out bounced the old woman. I immedi-<br>ately clapped her under my arm and made one jump, and landed<br>on the New Bridge accidentally, I struck my toe against the bat-<br>tlement, and both of us fell into the Clyde, where the old woman<br>being very much tird, she was not able to creep out of thewater,<br>so there she remained, and was burnt into ashes in a blaze of cold<br>water before I could save her.</p>
