	<p> Riot in Stirling.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<p>An account of a serious riot which took<br>place in Stirling on Saturday the<br>19th April, 1823. when two dis<br>turbers of the Dead were almost torn<br>to pieces by the populace, and a party<br>of soldiers being brought from the<br>Castle to quell the riot, fired on the<br>mob, when several persons were<br>wounded.<p>On the evening of Saturday the 19th of April last, a serious af-<br>fray took place in Stirling. The populace, whose dislike ever'y<br>where to the resurrection  men is so well known, assembled in a<br>tamultuous manner, and attacked the houses and persons of Jas.<br>M'Nab and Daniel Mitchell, who had been that day dismissed<br>from the bar of the Justiciary Court, their trial for violating the<br>sepulchres of the dead having been deserted pro loco et tempore.<br>The poor men escaped with much difficulty, and were forced to<br>take refuge in the prison from which they had just been liberated.<p>Mr M'Donald of Staffa, Sheriff of the county, Provost Thom-<br>son, and Captain Jeffrey of the 77th regiment, used every exer-<br>tion, and exposed themselves greatly in the attempt to lodge one<br>of the men Mitchell safe in the jail, the other having been carried<br>thither without much difficulty. Finding all their endeavours<br>fruitless, they were under the necessity of calling in a party of the<br>77th, So soon as the military arrived, Mitchell was brought<br>down from the house where he had taken refuge; but whenever<br>he was discovered by the populace, there was an instantaneous<br>mob, accompanied with the most threatening exclamations. The<br>mob, especially those near the mouth of the close, became quite<br>infuriated and unmanageable at the sight of him ; but notwith-<br>stand all this, they confined themslves to expressions of indigna-<br>tion, and offered no violence or outrage during the first part of<br>the act of removal, nor till the Provost and Sheriff had reached<br>the back, or south side of the jail, with the prisoner At this<br>moment, one of the soldiers who was near the Sheriff, being<br>unfortunately much intoxicated, fell down among the crowd, at<br>which moment the Sheriff was observed to help him up, and<br>conduct him with in the line of soldiers. directing one of his com-<br>rades to take charge of his firelock. This accident having creat-<br>ed some confusion, by enabling the mob to .press more closely on<br>the soldiers,one of the latter, by using his musket indiscreetly, and<br>striking the crowd violently with the butt end of it, occasioned<br>much irritation ; so much so, that at length two of the crowd at-<br>tempted to take the flselock from him, which induced him to fire.<br>Immediately on this, one or two more shots were fired, and an<br>attempt to charge on the populace by some, while others of the<br>military showed much forbearance, and seconded the efforts o<br>their commanding officers to bring their companions to order<br>Sexeral of the men were in a state of intoxication, and but little<br>under the control of any authority whatever. Stones were thrown<br>ndiscriminately from various quarters against the soldiers, some<br>of whom were knocked down.<p>Fortunately none of ahe shots took effect; from which circumstance<br>it is to be presumed that the object of the military was more to intimi-<br>date than to take away life. Two or three of the inhabitants were<br>slightly  wounded by the bayonet,  .and one young man received a danger-<br>ous wound a little below the breast. Several of the soldiers received<br>contusions.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<p>We are informed that the Sheriff, accompanied by the Provost im-<br>mediately proceeded  to the Castle, in order to ascertain the names of<br>tbe soldiers who fired. This Captain Jeffray at once furnished. Such<br>a measure was most proper ; for it is evident that as no order was given<br>to the military by a Magistrate or by a Commanding Officer, those who<br>flred were guilty of a breach of the peace. We understand five of then<br>were immediately placed in condemnation. It was about half-past<br>eight when the disturbance terminated.</p>
