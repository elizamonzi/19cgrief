	<p> Lamentation<p>OF&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  <p>Eilizabeth Banks,<p>Presently lying under Sentence of Death in the Calton-Hill Jail, and who is<br>to be Executed Edinburgh on Monday the 3d day of August next, for<br>the Horrid and Barbarous Murder of PETER BANKS, her husband, at<br>Pathhod, by giving him a quantity of Arsenic in a doze of Epsom Salts<br>on the 28th of April last, of which he died the same day in great agony.<p>ELIZABETH M'NIEL or NIEL, of BANKS or BAULKS, was ar-<br> raigned at the liar of the High Court of Justiciary, on Monday the<br>13th day of July 1335, on a charge of wilfully, wickedly, and feloniously<br>mizing a quantity of arsenic in a doze of Epsom salts, which she adminis<br>tered to Peter Banks or Baulks, her husband, on the 28th of April last, in<br>consequence of which he was immediately taken violently ill, and died on or<br>about the same day.<p>The purchasing of poison by the prisoner, under the pretence of killing<br>rate, was proved by Mr Otto, surgeon,Pathhead, by Mrs Otto, and their<br>daughter Sarah; and the mixing of a whitish powder along with the salts<br>was deponed to by a. sow of the deceased by a former wife, and his severe<br>pain and vomiting, and consequent death.?Ann M'Gregor, the house-keeper<br>at Chesterhall, gave the prisoner a shilling as charity, and the Ottos depos-<br>ed to. the prisoner tendering a shilling in payment of the arsenic, she receiv-<br>tenpence in change.?Jean Scougall, a very old woman and next door neigh-<br>bour, deponed to the state in which she saw the deceased, whose illness the<br>prisoner said was cholera, but that he would not hear of a doctor.?-The<br>prisoner had a discoloured eye at the time, for which she accounted in vari-<br>ous ways : but she had been heard to say that her husband bad struck her,.<br>and that he would repent it.?Mr Alexander Watson, surgeon, opened the<br>body of the deceased, in presence of Mr J. P. Rae, upon which there was no<br>external marks of injury, but in the stomach there was a considerable quan- .<br>tity of arsenic?much more than sufficient to cause death.?Mr Rae and<br>Professor Traill had no doubt that the deceased had died from arsenic.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; |<p>The pannel was then sentenced to be executed on Monday the 3d day of<br>August  next, at the usual place of execution in the Lawn-Market, or at<br>such other place as may be fixed upon by the Magistrates of the City.<p>The unfortunate culprit, who is of a meagre like appearance, and of about<br>fifty years of age, heard her awful doom pronounced with little visible dis-<br>composure,?Since her condemnation she has attempted to starve hereself<br>she resolutely refused all food until the Friday, when she at length yielded<br>to the cravings of hunger,?and recommenced the course on Saturday, but<br>has since again given in.<p>Dear friends, bear my sad moaning,<br>In prison I lie groaning,<br>By death to make atoning<br>For murder of my spouse.<p>Take pity, now, I pray, friends,<br>For short, short is my stay, friends ;<br>I'11 soon be In the day, friends,<br>Beneath  prison house.<p>0  when I married first, friends,<p>I  thought that I was blest, friends,<br>But here I lie half curst, friends.<p>In chains, alas! I'm bound,<p>Sore, sore, I now repent, friends,<br>For fear to h?I I'm sent, friends ;<br>My heart is like to rent, friends,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;{ dream of devil' sound.<p><p>  O, wives, take an example,<p>Of bad wives I'm a sample;<br>When hang'd they'll on me  trample,<br>In  prison tinder ground.<p>" The hour it fast approaches,"<br>I dread the sound of coaches-<br>O pity such poor wretches,<br>Like me few can he found.<p>My Peter he had no fault-?<br>That day I drank too much malt,<br>Which made me mix the death salt<br>For which I'll soon be hang'd.<p>O pray, friends, for a mortal,<br>To you it can't be hurtful;<br>My crime it was most dreadful?-<br>Pray that I'll not be d?d,<p>Sanderson, Printer, High Street, Edinburgh.</p>
