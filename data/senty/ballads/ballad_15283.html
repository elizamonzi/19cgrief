	<h2>Transcription</h2>
	<p> Last Speech of MARGARET CUNNINGHAME before her excution,<p>Who was executed at the west end of the Tolbooth of Edinburgh, on Wednesday<br>the 7th of January 1807, for the horrid crime of poisoning John Mason, her husband, in February last, and her body given for Dissection.<p>ON Wednesday the 7th instant, in pursu-<br>ance of her sentence, was executed at<br>the west end of the Tolbooth, in Edinburgh,<br>Margaret Cunninghame, for the horrid crime<br>of administering poisonin a cup of tea to John<br>Mason,flax dresser in Pathhead, parish of Dy-<br>sart, and county of Fife, her husband, on the<br>12th or 13th days of February 1806, and sus-<br>picion having fallen upon her the one John<br>Skinner, Flesher in Pathhead, they absconded<br>from justice, being pursued, Margaret Cun-<br>ninghame was apprehended and brought to<br>trial at the Circuit Court of Perth in May last,<br>when the jury found her guilty ; but being with<br>child, sentence was postponed, and an interlo-<br>cutor pronounced, that she should be carried<br>to Edinburgh and examined by matrons, who<br>were to give in their report, on oath, to the<br>Court, which they did, establishing the fact of<br>her pregnancy.<p>The sentence was then suspended till she<br>should be brought to bed and recovered, which<br>time having elapsed, she was again brought be-<br>fore the Court, on the 2oth .of November last,<br>and received the sentence of the law, which<br>was that she be carried back, to the Tolbooth of<br>Edinburgh and there to be fed upon bread and<br>water till the 7th of January next, and upon<br>that day to be taken to the common place of<br>execution, and there to be hung by the neck<br>until dead and her body to be given for public<br>dissection.<p>The Court giving her a solemn admonition<br>to prepare for her latter end, she appeared as<br>regardless as if nothing had happened, her ima-<br>gination leading her to think ail was a farce,<br>and that she would not suffer; nor could she,<br>till such time as the child was taken from her,<br>be brought to a right sense of her approaching<br>fate ; and even then she indulged herself in the<br>hopes of a pardon, although often told none<br>would make intercession for her, and that her<p>crime.was of such a nature that she could not<br>with any probability expect it.<p>For these two weeks past she seemed to la<br>her account with death, and by the attention<br>the Reverend Clergy paid to her, she became<br>more penitent, lamenting at the folly and frail-<br>ty of her .nature, which so easily yielded to the<br>seduction of unlawful lust, and the bad usage<br>she had given to the best of husbands, but being<br>encouraged by her cruel seducer, she became<br>regardless of him and her children, often going<br>to balls, dances and merry meetings with her<br>cruel adviser, who had put it in her head to<br>do what she had done She said it was the<br>third time she intended to ruin her husband,.<br>which at last too fatally had taken effect ; but<br>she hoped none would be so cruel as cast up<br>her untimely, end to her children or her rela-<br>tions, and that her connection with Skinner<br>had been the cause her untimely end.<p>She was born in the parish of Kinglassie, of<br>decent parents, and has resided in pathhead<br>since her marriage.<p>It is sincerely hoped that all those who have<br>seen or may hear of her fatal exit, will take a<br>warning by her.downfal, and shun the precipice<br>on which she has fallen ; as they may be assured<br>that secret or premediated murder will be found<br>out either sooner or latter; and if in the course<br>of events, it should not come to light in this<br>world, yet the cruel perpetrators, if their con-<br>sciences are not feared as with a hot iron, will<br>say within themselves, How can they appear<br>before the God of all secrets ? who has declar-<br>ed in his most holy word, that the most hid-<br>den things shall be brought to the clearest light<br>in the next<p>As this unfortunate woman has fallen a vic-<br>tim to the .laws of her country, let all consider<br>that they who hath lived happily die securely;<br>and happy are  they who end  the business of<br>this life before their death.,</p>
