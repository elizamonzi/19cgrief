	<p> EXECUTION.<p>Confession and Execution<p>OF<p>HUGH  MACLEOD,<p>Who was Executed at Inverness on<br>the 24th of October, for the atrocious<br>MURDER of MURDO GRANT,<p>Pedlar, from Lochbroom.<p>No language can convey an idea of the awful state of the unfortunate criminal on<br>being removed to his cell. He tossed himself about in a manner which indicated the<br>poignancy of his feelings, and the secret workings of his heart. About an hour after<br>he had been sentenced to die, the Rev. Mr. Clark visited him, and the conversation<br>which ensued effected a great change in the unfortunate man. He eagerly enquired<br>whether it were yet possible to save his life, and on being answered in the negative,<br>he made a full confession of his guilt to Mr. Clark. The following is the substance of<br>the account he gives of the murder, which he said was perpetrated on Friday, the 19th<br>March, 1830, at a considerable distance from the place mentioned in the indictment.<p>He states that he was driven to the commission of the murder by pecuniary wants;<br>that he prowled all day on the 18th of March, firmly determined to commit murder<br>and robbery that he saw the pedlar, conceiving that he had money, Macleod said to<br>him that  be  would purchase his whole pack if he met him on the following day near<br>Loch-tor-na-egin ; that they accordingly met, Macleod having a hammer concealed<br>under his great coat;ILL After travelling a considerable distance, they came near <br>Loch-tor-na-egin, when Macleod, walked before the pedlar. The former looked<br>frequently round, which indnced the packman to ask, " What do you mean Hugh ?"<br>and instantly on this Macleod turned, and struck him a violent blow with the hammer<br>below the ear, which felled him to the ground. Macleod gave several other blows to<br>insure his death, and he could not conceive how so few wounds were observed on his<br>body. He said there was no quarrel, or attempt made to pick a quarrel with the<br>pedlar. " I without a moments notice drove the innocent man to eternity," was his<br>answer, emphatically given. when the question was asked. He described the horrible<br>and fiendish sensations with which he rifled his victim's pockets, out of which he took<br>a five pound, and two one pound notes, with a bag of silver and copper. He then<br>dragged the body by the feet into the loch?the murder having been committed<br>within a few yards of it?but his utmost exertions could not for some time sink the<br>corpse. He was, he said, trembling with fear that he might be seen; but in his own<br>Words,he " got strong?-very strong," and lifted a large stone, which, after much<br>exertion, he placed above the body. He then left the loch, and examined the pack<br>and the cash at a little distance from it. He took the cash with him, and concealed<br>the  pack in a cairn of stones.<p>After this he proceeded home, but slept none during night. A boy was along with<br>him in bed who snored very high, and this kept the dying agonies of the murdered<br>pedlar continually in his recollection. It was some days subsequent that he returned<br>to where the pack lay, and took stockings and a few other articles away. He most<br>solemnly asserts that he had no accomplice, and that the " dreamer" was as ignorant<br>of the murder as the child unborn. He added, that no person in Court was more as-<br>tonished at Fraser's evidence than he was, as he never placed or knew that the silk<br>handkerchiefs were in the spot where the officers found them.<p>The unfortunate man's behaviour in prison after the awful sentence was pronounced,<br>indicated great signs of penitence. He was visited by several clergymen, who were<br>continualiy imparting religious instructions to him. He was brought from his-cell' at<br>two o'clock, supported by the Rev. Messrs. Clark and Kennedy. When they arrived<br>at the place of execution, Macleod ascended the scaffold with a firm step, and having<br>ejaculated a short prayer, a psalm was sung, and the Rev. Messrs. Clark and Kennedy<br>prayed, he addressed the multitude in Gaelic as follows :?<p>My Friends,?It is not my intention to occupy much time in speaking. I beg you<br>will excuse me for addressing you in Gaelic, when I say that I am not so well acquaint-<br>ed with the English language. Here you behold me as one speaking to you from the<br>dead?it is true, I am dead to you?-you have Moses and the Prophets, hear them ;<br>if you hear them not, you will not hear them should one rise from the dead.<p>I was born of honest and God-fearing parents, whose counsel I cast behind me, and<br>now appear before you to undergo the Last sentence of the law. I acknowledge the<br>crime most justly laid to my charge.?I avow in the presence of the all-seeing God,<br>before whom I will ere long appear. that I and I alone have been the perpetrator of<br>this awful crime of murder for which 1 am about to suffer. But I thank my God that<br>this his precept has been so strictly obeyed ; but I am, according to the laws of God<br>and my country, which I have so grossly offended, thus to die the death. After ad-<br>monishing the people who assembled on the occasion, (about 7000,) he ascended the<br>steps. and alter si nging a few lines of the 51st Psalm, he said?" My God, receive my<br>soul,"?he then dropped the handkerchief, and was, without a struggle, launched into<br>eternity.<p>His body, after hanging three quarters of an hour, was cut down, placed in a coffin,<br>and taken to the jail?it was then crammed into a square box, and a couple of pecks<br>of salt thrown over it. and sent in a cart to Edinburgh, as neither carrier, coach, nor<br>ship, could be got to take if.<p>Aberdeen :  R, Cobban & Co.</p>
