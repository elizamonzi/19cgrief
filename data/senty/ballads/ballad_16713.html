	<p> EXECUTIONS  IN  PAISLEY.<p>With some of its observations on the infrequency of<br>these occurrences here the Glasgow Chronicle took oc-<br>casion to favour us last week. For the pains it takes in<br>gathering these scraps of local history, we would feel the<br>more grateful, were its information and accuracy in any<br>sort of proportion to its inclination to do us service. On<br>the subject of the eccentricities of our townsmen, and<br>the taste they may evince for these painful sights, the<br>journal in question may speculate at any length it likes,<br>and not be one whit nearer the truth than it often is on<br>subjects of more importance. But even on this point,<br>we scarcely think the inhabitants of Paisley shew a keen-<br>er relish than their neighbours. Judging from the num-<br>bers of draggle tailed sluts and dirty linened fellows who<br>crowded our streets on Thursday, it required no prophet<br>to tell us, that the City of St. Mungo had its thousands<br>tainted with this appetite for ghastly enjoyment, in quite<br>as perfect a degree as any living wight within the balidome<br>of St. Mirren could pretend to. Proud of its inadequate<br>knowledge, the Chronicle of Friday week thus repeats the<br>imperfect information it had communicated in a preceding<br>number:-"It may here be not uninteresting again to re-<br>capitulate the executions that have taken place in Paisley<br>since 1697. On the 15th June, in that year, 4 men and<br>3 women were burned on the Gallowgreen, for witch-<br>craft. In 68 years after, viz., on the 7th Nov. 1765, a<br>Glasgow fast day, a murderer of the name of Provan,<br>was executed on the same spot, and his right hand cut<br>off. On the 17th Aug. 1797, a period of 32 years after<br>the former, a man of the name of Potts, convicted of rob-<br>bery at Gryffe Castle, was executed at the market Cross;<br>and from that time to the present date, other 32 years<br>have elapsed."<p>The very little information the writer had on this sub-<br>ject, will be apparent by and by. A good natured<br>friend, with the view of supplying the deficiencies of this<br>statement in the Chronicle of Monday last, under the<br>designation of "an Inhabitant of Paisley," tells us that<br>" In 1685, during the tyrannical reign of James, it is<br>well known to all who are versant in the history of that<br>bloody period, that James Edgar and John Park suffered<br>at the Cross of Paisley for their firm adherence to the<br>sacred cause of civil and religious liberty.<p>"With regard to criminal cases, I have also to mention,<br>that sometime before the middle of the last century, a<br>man of the name of Robert Lyle, was executed at Pais-<br>ley for theft, and being habit and repute; and that a<br>few years afterwards, a man of the name of Love, who<br>resided and had property in the High Street, was exe-<br>cuted for the murder of his son, whom he stabbed with<br>a knife, in a fit of passion, when sitting with his family<br>at dinner."-Even the " inhabitant of Paisley" has<br>fallen into an error, by substituting Edgar for Algie, and<br>his notice respecting Lyle and Love is exceedingly vague,<br>inasmuch as it does not give the precise date when<br>these individuals were respectively gibbeted on the gal-<br>low green.<p>For the antiquarian lucubrations of the Chronicle and<br>its correspondents we have as much respect as they de-<br>serve, but the value of such pursuits depends so much<br>upon accuracy, that whenever we detect the slightest<br>departure from historical fidelity, or an unbecoming lack<br>of information, we may be excused for treating them<br>with something like contempt, more especially, when by<br>a little research, more facts, and greater accuracy, could<br>easily have been obtained.<p>Since on this subject our townsmen have evinced some<br>curiosity, we shall put them in possession of a few slight<br>notices, which have occurred to us in the course of our<br>enquiries. We may premise, that deficiencies in our Lo-<br>cal Registers, and in the Books of Adjournal, prevent us<br>from carrying these back to any thing approaching a<br>remote date.<p>From the declaration of W. Sutherland, contained in<br>the Appendix to Wodrow's History, Vol. I. it appears<br>that that individual was necessitated to officiate at the<br>execution of a witch in this town, in the year 1661.<p>In the year following, the parish of Innerkip was over-<br>run with a breed of witches, and their pranks became so<br>notorious, that a commission was issued (7th May 1622)<br>to certain noblemen and gentlemen of the county, to try<br>Mary Lamond, Katrine Scot, Janet Hynman, Margret<br>Leitch, Margret Rankine, Jean King, and Margaret<br>Duff, for " the horrid cryme of witchcraft, by committing<br>of malefices, or entering into pactiouns with the divell,<br>renuncing their baptisme or otherwayes, &c." Most of<br>these infatuated creatures pled guilty to the crimes of<br>which they were charged, and were convicted on their<br>own confessions, and doomed to death. Where they<br>suffered, does not appear; but as these courts, for the triai<br>of Witchcraft in this county, were usually held in Paisley,<br>it is likely they were, according to the received mode of<br>dispatching condemned witches and sorcerers,  "worryit,<br>(that is strangled) at a stake and brint" on the Gallow-<br>Green.<p>The Jail about that time was seldom without a witch<br>or warlock tenant, and as there was not then so much Jail<br>philanthropy abroad as in our day, many of these poor<br>and aged wretches died in the loathsome cells where they<br>were confined, some literally devoured by vermin, others<br>the victims of disease or of brutal usage. A witch dying<br>in prison here gives occasion for this curious entry in the<br>Records of the Town Council.<p>" 1667 Oct. 17. Whilk day the Baillies and Councill<br>having taken to their consideration the incivility and<br>indiscreit carriage of Mr Hugh Montgomerie, Sheriff<br>Depute of Renfrew, in permittiug the corpse of ane Janet<br>Finnie, ane suspect witch imprisoned be him in their Jail<br>and deceased therein, to be unhurried these fyve days by-<br>gone or thereby, and refusing absolutely to cause bury her<br>notwithstanding both his duty and their requiring of him,<br>so that they are necessitated to cause bury her, have<br>therefore determined that he shall be deprived of certain<br>favours he has from them, especially that he and his sons<br>shall have no liberty from henceforth to sit in any of the<br>Tounes Seats in the Churches, and for these reasons have<br>ordained their officers to hold them out of both their seats."<p>Though there is some uncertainty regarding the precise<br>number or the place of execution of the Innerkip witches,<br>none exists regarding those who suffered for bewitching<br>Sir George Maxwell of Pollok, and by devilish sorceries<br>tormenting him until he died.<p>Accordingly on the 20th Feb. 1677, we find that four<br>witches and a warlock were burnt at the Gallowgreen of<p>Paisley for this horrid crime. This case has been amply<br>enough detailed in various publications, and we will not<br>dwell longer on it than merely to mention the names of the<br>unfortunate creatures whose lives were sacrificed on the<br>gloomy altar of popular superstition. They were Janet<br>Mathie, Bessie Weir, Margaret Jackson, John Stewart,<br>Marjory Craig, and Annabel Stewart. " Annabel, the<br>maid witch among them, about the age of 14, albeit<br>penitent and confessing yet throw pitty was throw order<br>of the secret council reprieved from burning."<p>Of this execution, Mr Robert Law, minister of Kil-<br>patrick, in his Memorials, furnishes us with these details:-<br>" The four witches and warlock foresaid, that were burnt<br>at Paisley on the 20th February (for the young one was<br>reprieved for a tyme because of her age) dyed obduredly,<br>except the man, who appeared penitent, whose mother,<br>Jonat Mathie, was first hanged without any confession of<br>her guilt, and the effigies both of wax and clay being put<br>in a napkine and dashed in pieces, were thrown in the<br>fire with her. Her son and daughter confessed that when<br>the Devil appeared first to them in her house, that she<br>(their mother) called him a gentleman to them, and a good<br>man that would not hear the Lord's name mentioned, for<br>fear it should be taken in vain. There was also one Bessie<br>Weir hanged up, the last of the four (one that had been<br>taken before in Ireland, and was condemned to the fyre<br>for malefice before, and when the hangman there was about<br>to cast her over the gallows, the devill takes her away from<br>them out of their sight; her dittay was sent over here to<br>Scotland) who, at this tyme, when she was cast off the<br>gallows, there appears a raven, and approaches the hang-<br>man within an ell of him, and flyes away again. All the<br>people observed it and cried out at the sight of it!"<p>Feb. 3, 1685, James Algie and John Park were exe-<br>cuted for refusing to take the oath of abjuration. Betwixt<br>their sentence and its execution, only a few hours inter-<br>vened, for the inscription on their tombstone tells us, that<br>they were<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" At ten condemned, at two to die."<br>The tombstone lies on the ground, laid off for a church-<br>yard in Broomlands.<p>In 1687, we had another witch trial here; but whether<br>there were any convictions we have not had the means of<br>discovering.<p>We now come to the famous Bargarran case in which<br>some four and twenty individuals, male and female, were<br>implicated. One of these, Jean Fulton, an aged woman,<br>appears to have died in jail, and another, John Reid,<br>Smith in Inchinnan, succeeded in strangling himself in<br>the prison of Rentrew, and a third, Alexander Anderson,<br>also died in prison. On the 10th of June, 1697, three<br>men and four women were burned on the Gallowgreen,<br>for bewitching Christian Shaw, and being habit and repute<br>witches. The Chronicle, with its usual accuracy tells us<br>this was on the 15th of the month, and that there were<br>four men and three women. To obviate error, we may<br>mention that the men were John Lindsay in Barloch, alias<br>Bishop James Lindsay, alias Curate; both these had been<br>delatit witches in 1687, but got off through their in-<br>genuity ; and another man whose name has escaped our<br>memory. The women executed, were Margaret Lnng,<br>Katherine Campbell, Agnes Naismith, and Margaret<br>Fulton. It appears that the dress of the Sheriff of Ren-<br>frewshire was remarkably gay. On his visit to Christian<br>Shaw, he is described as wearing brown coloured clothes,<br>red plush breeches with black stripes, flowered muslin<br>cravat, and an embroidered sword belt.<p>In 1694 John, William, and Robert Jamieson, wea-<br>vers in Broomhead, were tried before the Sheriff for<br>sheep-stealing, housebreaking, theft, &c., two of them<br>assoilzied and one found guilty, who, in all likelihood<br>suffered a capital punishment, but the record from<br>which this notice is taken is unfortunately defective. On<br>the 28 Nov. 1700 James Laird, turner in Gorbals, was<br>hanged on the Gallowgreen of Paisley, by sentence of<br>Robert Sempill of Fullwood, Bailie-Depute of the Re-<br>gality. He was tried for stouthrieff, theft, &c.<p>28th March, 1717, Robert Lang, in Langbank, was<br>executed between the hours of two and four afternoon, on<br>the Gallowgreen of Paisley, for the theft of a gray horse,<br>which he had twice stolen, and was twice taken, as it is<br>technically styled, " with the fang." His Judge was<br>Robert Sempill, Sheriff-Depute.<p>September 2d, 1743, Robert Love, Messenger, was<br>hanged here for the murder of his own son.<p>27th December, 1753 Robert Lyle, in Culliochant,<br>parish of Kilbarchan, was hanged at the Gallowgreen be-<br>tween the hours of 10 and 3. He was tried before the<br>Sheriff for housebreaking and theft. He was familiarly<br>styled Rabbie Lyle. His executioner was a fellow pri-<br>soner, whose punishment, it is said, was remitted if he<br>would undertake that disagreeable office. To obtain<br>his liberty the fellow agreed, but did the thing so bung-<br>lingly, that it provoked the wrath of some native Satyrist,<br>who, in his rhymes, alleged that in turning off Lyle the <br>Hangman broke his head in the first place, and his neck<br>afterwards.<p>The next who suffered on the Gallowgreen was the<br>detestable ruffian, Alexander Provan, for the murder of<br>his wife. The circumstances attending this murder are<br>shocking, and cannot be related. He was hanged on<br>the 7th Nov, 1765, his right hand having been previously<br>smitten off. According to tradition, the hangman,<br>through trepidation, severed his hand by the palm in-<br>stead of at the wrist, and Provan, with a dreadful<br>shriek, cried out " the tow, the tow, the tow." The<br>rope was immediately brought, and a termination put to<br>his sufferings. The axe used to back off his hand was<br>long kept as a relic, and shown as Provan's axe to those<br>curious in these matters.<p>Thomas Potts, an Irishman, was tried before the High<br>Court of Justiciary for housebreaking and robbery at<br>Gryffecastle, found guilty, and sentenced to be exe-<br>cuted at Paisley, on the 17th August 1797. A crane<br>was erected at the corner of the Tolbooth-the bats<br>which supported it are still to be seen in the walls of the<br>steeple-and on this he was suspended from half past<br>three till a quarter past four. Potts wrote a number of<br>letters, which were published after his death, and in<br>which he asserted his innocence of the crime for which he<br>was tried, but admitted the commission of others equally<br>bad. The same declaration he made on the scaffold.<p>These annals of the stake and gibber in Paisley, close<br>with the execution of Brown and Craig, in front of the<br>County Buildings, on Thursday the 29th ult.</p>
