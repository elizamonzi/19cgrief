	<h2>Transcription</h2>
	<p> An account of the strange and wonderful manner in which John Fox, who some time ago lived<br>near Nottingham, was sorely afficted with an Evil Spirit, that threw him into fits, de-<br>prived him of the power of speech, spoke within him, and endeavoured to baffle the efforts of<br>the Ministers who attended him, whose names are here mentioned; also an account how he was<br>at length relieved, after remaining three years dumb, and lived a virtuous and religious life.<p>IN the life of Mr. Richard Rothwell (a  famous<br>Preacher at Mansfield, in the county of Nothing-<br>ham) we have this remarkable account, as  it was<br>drawn up by Mr. Stanly GOWER of Dorchester:<br>There was one John Fox, living about Nottingham,<br>who had no more learning than enabled&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;him to Write:<br>and read. This man was possessed with a devil,<br>who would violently throw him down; and take<br>away the use of every member of his body, which<br>was changed as black as pitch, while  those fits  were<br>upon him; and then spoke  with an audible voice <br>within him, which seemed sometimes  to sound out<br>of his belly, sometimes out of his throat, and some-<br>times out of his mouth, his lips not moving; and<br>thus he continued for a considerable time;  many<br>prayers were put up to God for  him and great re-<br>sort was made to him, especially  by several famous<br>ministers, as Mr. Bernard of Batcomb, Mr. Lanly<br>of  Traswell, and others, betwixt whom  and  John<br>Fox there passed  many papers, in writing, he dis-<br>covering his temptations, and  they writing him an-<br>swers because he was struck dumb, as will be af-<br>terwards seen.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<p>Among the rest, Mr. Rothwell went to see him,<br>and, before he came, the devil told all that were in<br>the house of it, saying,  'Yonder comes Rothwell,<br>but I will make a fool of him before he goes; where-<br>upon the people looked out, and saw him coming,<br>about a quarter of a mile from the house; as soon as <br>he entered the room, the devil said, ' Now, Roth-<br>well is come,' and, as some say, added,' Thou sayest<br>there is no possession; what thinkest thou now? here<br>is a man opens not his lips, and yet he speaketh;'<br>and, after a while, he said, ' Say nothing to me of<br>this man, for I tell thee he is damned,' and he ad-<br>ded thereto many fearful blasphemies.<p>Rothwell? Thou art a liar, and the father of lies;<br>nor art thou so well acquainted with the mind of<br>God concerning this man, which makes thee thus to<br>torment him; therefore I believe thee not; I believe<br>he shall be saved by Jesus Christ.<p>Davi'r?He is a murderer, and thou knowest no<br>murderer must come inio heaven<p>Rothwell? Thou liest, for David murdered, and<br>Is in heaven; and the Jews, with wicked hands,<br>crucified the Lord of Glory, yet Christ prayed for<br>them; and St. Peter exhorted them to repentance,<br>that their fins might be blotted out<p>Devil?But this man hath not repented, cannot,<br>shall not repent<p>Rothwell?If he had not repented, thou  would it<br>not have told him so; but if he  has not, I believe<br>God will give him repentance, and thou shall  not<br>be able to hinder it.<p>Devil?Thou art a murderer thyself, and yet<br>talkest thou thus?<p>Rothwell? Thou liest again; I have only fought<br>the Lord's battles against his known enemies.<p>Then the devil swore and blasphemed, saying,<br>Thou didst murder one this day, as thou camest<br>hither, and there is one behind thee who will testity <br>it;' upon which Mr. Rothwell  looking  over his<br>shoulder, the devil set up an hideous laugther, that<br>nothing could be heard tor a great while, and then<br>said, ' Look you now, did not I tell you that I<br>would make Rothwell a fool? and yet it is trne,<br>thou didst murder one this day, for as thou camest<br>along such a bridge (which he named) there I would<br>have killed thee, and there thy horse trod upon a<br>fly, and killed it.'&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It seems Mr. Rothwell's hoese<br>stumbled at that place, the devil having power to<br>cause it, though&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;without hurt to either horse or<br>man?Mr.R. then said, ' Thou hast often be-<br>guiled me, but I hope God will in time give me<br>wisdom  to discern, and power to withstand all me<br>delusions, and he it is that hath devlivered  me out of<br>thy hands, and, I doube not, will also deliver this<br>poor man;'&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the devil&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;then blasphemed fearfully,<br>and quoted many scriptures out of the Old and New<br>Testament, both in Hebrew and Greek,cavilling<br>and playing the critic therewith, and backing his<br>allegations out of the  fathers  and poets, in their<br>own language, which he quoted very  readily, so<br>that the company trembled to hear such things from<br>one that understood no learining, and neither moved<br>tongue nor lip all the while; but Mr. Rothwell was<br>wonderfully enabled, by divine power, to detect the<br>devil's sophistry; upon which the devil said,' What<br>need I stand talking with thee, all men know thou<br>art bold Rothwell; and thou fearest nobody, nor<br>carest for word,therefore I'll talk to thee no thore,<br>Mr. R.turning to the people, said, 'Good people. <br>you see the  goodness of our God, and  his great<br>power,  though the devil made a fool of me even<br>now,  through my weakness, God hath made the<br>devil dumb now; do but observe how the man lies,<br>therefore Let us  go  to  prayer, and that God who<br>hath made him dumb, will,I doubt not, drive him<br>out of this poor man.'&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The devil hereupon raged,<br>blasphemed, and said, ' If  thou go to prayer, I will<br>make such a noise that thy prayer shall be distracted,<br>and thou knowest God will  not hear a distracted<br>prayer; but  thou hast got a device, because  thou<br>wilt  not be distracted, thou shuttest thy eyes in<br>prayer (for so he always did) but if thou pray, I<br>will pull out thy eyes!'&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr. R. replied,I look<br>to find thee as great an enemy in this duty now, as<br>I have done heretofore, but I fear not thy threats,<br>I  know  thou&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;art  limited, aad&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;God heareth the<br>prayers of the upright, therefore, in the name of<br>his Son,  Jesus Christ, we will go to prayer;' and<br>accordingly they did so, Mr. Rothwell kneeling by<br>the bed-side where the poor man lay.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The devil<br>made a most horrible noise; however.  Mr, R,'s<br>voice was louder than his, and in a thort time the<br>divil roared at the very face of  Mr. R. wherewith<br>the body of the man moved, and the hand was held<br>up which was the first time he stirred; Mr. Roth-<br>well took the hand, and held it down with much<br>ease, two men being scarcely able to hold the other<br>hand;yet prayers were still continued,  and at length<br>the devil lay silent in the man, and soon after de-<br>parted out of him; the man then fetched many deep<br>sighs, insomuch that they belived he was dying,<br>but his colour suddenly returned, and the use of all<br>his members, senses, and understanding; and at the<br>next petition, to the glory of God, and amazement<br>of all the company, he cried out, Amen! where-<br>upon they all returned thanks to the Almighty, and <br>departed to their homes.<p>Mr  Rothwell now desired the  man to take some<br>food, but he refused, saying, the devil told him he<br>would be choaked with the first bit  he should eat;<br>but Mr. R. forced him to eat, after  which he grew<br>quite well.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr. R then left  him, when he was in-<br>stantly \struck dumb, and remained so for three years,<br>after which he recovered his speech, and lived re-<br>ligiously and virtuously till the day of his death.<br>Printed by T.Duncan, Glasgow.</p>
