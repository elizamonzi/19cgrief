	<p> LETTER<p>FROM JOHN KEAN TO THE LORD PROVOST<br>AND MAGISTRATES.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<p>An account of the Public Whipping  of JOHN KEAN, for<br>Shooting at JOHN GRAHAM, a Cotton-spinner, which took<br>place on Wednesday the llth of May, on a Platform erected<br>in front of Glasgow Jail, in presence of an immense multi-<br>tude of Spectators. Also, the Copy of a most extraordinary<br>Letter which he presented to the Lord Provost and Magis-<br>trates on Monday last.<p>THE above unfortunate individual, it will be recollected, Was tried and found<br>guilty of a most diabolical attempt to murder John Graham, a cotton-spinner,<br>by shooting him with a pistol, as he was returning home form his work, in the Cal-.<br>ton. The prisoner is a native of Belfast, about 30 years of age, and has a wife and<br>young family. He was always considered a sober, honest, inoffensive tradesman,<br>till the unfortunate misunderstanding betwixt the Matter Cottonspinners and Oper-<br>atives occurred, when it is much to be feared that he was urged on to the commis-<br>sion of the crime of which he was found guilty, more by the suggestion of some lrid-<br>din villains, than by the innate depravity of his own disposition.<p>The following is the Petition which he presented to the Lord Provost and Magis-<br>trates, on Monday last, praying for a mitigation of his punishment:?<br>Unto the Honourable the Lord Provost and Magistrates of Glasgow,<br>The Petition of John Kean, prisoner in Glasgow jail,<br>Humbly Sheweth,<p>[  ] the punishment which the petitioner has been adjudged to suffer, on the [  ]<br>[  ] being left to the discretion of your Honours, he, in all humility throws,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>[  ] at your feet, imploring for mercy in the number and quality of stripes, ben<br>Constitutionally delicate and nervous, increased by&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the nature of his employment<br>and rendered unwell and weak from deep anguish and long and close confinement<br>end having mother, wife, children, brothers, sisters, and&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;friends, whose hearts will<br>be convulsed at the punishment, and whose feelings, he is more anxious to spare than<br>his own: beseeching you to recollect, that to exhibit Cruel punishment to the pub-<br>lic does not reform but deteriorates character, and  is opposed to the intelligence and <br>benevolence of good men:<p>And&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;your Petitioners  all ever pray-<p>JOHN KEAN.<p>Glasgow, 9th May' 1825.<p>At an early hour this morning a number of  me in were engaged in  putting up the<br>scaffold which was erected at the usual place of  execution in front of the prison. It<br>consisted of strong tresses, across which were la id stout planks, and in the center<br>Of which was firmly fixed a whipping-post, the a hole being surrounded by a strong<br>railing. The culprit ascended the scaffold soon after 12 o'clock, and after having<br>been bound by the hands, and feet to the post, and his back stripped bare, the Exe-<br>cutioner proceeded to inflict the punishment when he gave him 80 stripes,and from<br>the appearance of the unhappy man's body, be n ust have felt grest pain, A great<br>number of the public works having been shut up the crowd was the largest since the<br>execution of James Wilson for high treason; and with shame do we say it, a great<br>proportion of whom were females. The whole operation did not last long, the crowd<br>being nearly all dispersed by half-past 12 o'clock.<p>We trust that the punishment thus inflicted, will have a most salutary effect<br>on those for which the above awful example is intended, and teach them that the arm<br>of the law is strong, and able to reach and punish all who transgress, or were guilty<br>of such criminal proceedings.<p>Since the trial of Kean took place, the Lord Advocate of Scotland has given ao.<br>tiec of his intention to introduce a bill into Parliament to extend Lord Ellenborough's<br>Act to Scotland, by which all crimes of the above description, will in future be pu<br>nished with Death.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<p>Printed  by John Muir.</p>
