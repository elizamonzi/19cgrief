	<p> A particular account of John Thomson,  a journey-<br>man plasterer,  who has been working in one of<br>the New&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Buildings&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;in&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lord  Moray's Park, for&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;six weeks<br>past.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;lodged near the canal bason,  and who was dis-<br>covered by a strange&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;accident,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;be  a Female, on Tuesday<br>last, and who is the same woman that went under the name of<br>John Oliver, last year in Glasgow,  and followed the  trades of<br>a weaver. plasterer and Flesher.<p>A female was discovered on Tuesday last, working in one of<br>those New Buildings rearing in Lord Murray's Park, as a<br>Journeyman Plasterer; and went by the name of John<br>Thomson, upon enquiry, she is the same that was discovered<br>in Glasgow last year, and before describing how she was dis-<br>covered on Tuesday last, we copy her life, from the Glasgow<br>Chronicle published at that time.<p>She belonnged originally to&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Saltcoats,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;is  about  twenty-<br>seven years of age, and for better than four years she has, of<br>her own free choice, worn the attire, and discharged the la-<br>borious duties, of one of the Male Sex.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Her real&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;name&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;is<br>Helen Oliver: but she has assumed the name of her brother<br>John.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; About six years ago, while she was a maid servant in<br>a farm house in west Kilbride, a particular intimacy took place<br>between her and a person in a neighbouring house, who osi-<br>eiated as ploughman.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Being  frequently seen  walking to-<br>gether in queit and sequestrated places,  they were regarded<br>as lovers; ultimately however this " ploughman" turned out<br>to be also a female; and it  is  believed by Helen's relatives<br>and acquaintances, that it was the arguments of this person-<br>age which&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;induced&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;her&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;abandon&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the female dress and<br>duties,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Upon Sunday the 4th of January,  1818, while in<br>her parent's house at Saltcoats, she requested her mother to<br>give her her " wee cutty pipe," and she would give her two<br>new ones in exchange.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To this unusual demand the mother<br>after some questions assented ; and early on  the following<br>morning,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Helen&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;helped&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;herself to a suit of her brother's<br>clothes and disappeared.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She went to Glasgow, where she<br>learned&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;plastering&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;business, and wrought at it in Kil-<br>marnock, Paisley, Lanark,  and  Edinburgh.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She  returned<br>again to Glasgow, where she got a master, but shortly after<br>her master employed a man who belonged to Saltcoats, and<br>who knew her,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;he told&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the other workmen  that she was a<br>female; being thus discovrred, she wrote a letter to her em-<br>ployer, thanking him for his kindness to her,  and confessed<br>that she was a woman.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is  supposed&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;she went to Aber-<br>deen after leaving Glasgow, as she said she wrought in that<br>quarter last, when her present master&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;employed  her;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;she<br>has been working at the same house for six weeks back, and<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; lodged with a washerwoman adjoining the Canal Basin, her<br>neighbour workman never took the&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;least  suspicion&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of her<br>being a female, but observed that she was a delicate person,<br>and thought her rather consumptive,  her colour was&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ruddy,<br>but her make of a slender form for a man, she  would&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;have<br>been at her work still without creating the least suspicion, as&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;she never associated with her neighbour workman, but an ac-<br>cident happened last Tuesday which made her make her  es-<br>cape, she was mounted on a scaffold about 5 feet high, alrng<br>with two others, when her foot slipped and she tumnled down<br>her side struck a hod, which with the pain made her insensi-<br>ble for a few minntes, but the immediately&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;recovered,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and<br>wrought ds usual.<p>On&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of the men who was on the scaffold beside her, observed<br>while she  was&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;lying,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;that  the lime which  she had on the<br>hawk in her hand, had fallen about her neck and breast, and<br>he began to scrape it off, in doing which he loosed a button<br>of her waistcoat to get the lime cleaner off, and in so doing<br>he discovered her&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;sex,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but  said&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;nothing&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to her.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At the<br>dinner hour he told&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;his&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;neighbour  workmen what he had<br>discovered ; and they in the afternoon in her presence, talk-<br>ed of John Oliver, the female plasterer, who, they were sus-<br>picious was not far distant&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;from&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;them ? she&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;had seen that<br>she was discovered, and upon a&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;pretence of going for some<br>thing, she has not been seeu since, except by a labourer, who<br>knew her as John Thomson,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;that met her&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;on the Mussel-<br>burgh road, with a bundle below her arm, still in men's ap-<br>parel, and it is supposed she will find  work in  Haddington,<br>but in all liklihood, she will again change her name.</p>
