Barbara Dick was<br>intimate with the decased who, had told her that the prisoner<br>had given her a written promise that he would marry her.<p>Duncan Stewart had a conversation with prisoner, about eight<br>days before deceased's death; was rallying him in regard to his<br>dealings with her; prisoner said, " All that will soon be over," on<br>asking him what he meant by that, prisoner replied, You'll soon<br>hear.

John McDonald was with the prisoner on<br>the Sunday before the deceased's death ; prisoner took a razor<br>out of his pocket, because he said it was heavy ; gave it to wit-<br>ness asked him if it was sharp ; witness looked at it, found it<br>very sharp and returned to prisoner, who put it into his pocket.<br>A great deal of evidence of similar nature was afterward received.<p>The Advocate Depute addressed the Jury on the part of the<br>Crown; and Mr Smith on behalf of the prisoner.<p>Lord Meadowbank having summed up the evidence, the Ju-<br>ry after a short consultation, returned an unanimous verdict,<br>viva voce, finding the libel Proven.<p>Lord Meadowbank then addressed the unhappy man in a<br>speech of the most impressive nature, warning him against in-<br>dulging in the least hope of mercy in this world, and imploring<br>him to spend his few remaining days in serious and devout pre-<br>paration for the next. His Lordship then adjudged him to be<br>executed here on Friday, the 31st of May next, and his body<br>to be given for desection.<p>William Gordon, fishing tackle maker of this place, (Aberdeen)<br>accused of the murder of his wife, by inflicting a mortal wound<br>in her thigh.

Prompt medical aid<br>was immediately got, but she soon expired. After the examin-<br>ation of several witnesses, Lord Gillies summed up the evidence<br>shortly commenting on it as he went along; and the Jury hav-<br>consulted together for a few minutes, returned a viva voce ver-<br>dict finding the libel proven. Lord Gillies then pronounced<br>the awful sentenc of death, adjudging the prisoner to be exe-<br>euted at Aberdeen on Friday the 31st of May next, and his bo-<br>dy to by given for desection.</p>
