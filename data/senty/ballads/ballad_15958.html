	<p> A Full, True, and Particular Account of the GREAT<br>BATTLE fought by ROBINSON and CROSBIE,<br>in a field near West Craigs, on Saturday last, the<br>llth day of June 1825, for 200 Sovereigns.<p>ON Saturday last, the llth of June, 1825, the great boxing<br>match between Crosbie, the Glasgow pugilist, and Robinson,<br>the Yorbshiroman, for 200 sovereigns, took place hear West Craigs,<br>about 23 miles west from Edinburgh.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <p>At about half-past 11 the Commissariat Department commenced<br>operations in forming the ring, and at about 15 minntes before 1,<br>Robinson, with his second, Tom Reynolds, entered, and modestly<br>threw up his castor. He was received with considerable applause.<br>Crosbie soon followed (loud cheering from the Glasgow bodies),<br>and after bowing respectfully to the immense multitude collected,<br>in imitation of Robinson threw up his beaver in token of defiance.<br>Crosbie then shook hands with Robinson, and said, " he hoped he<br>was well," observing, " that if he (Crosbie) was beat that day, he<br>was beat in better condition than ever he had entered a ring before,"<br>Robinson, in reply, said, " I am glad to hear that you are well, that<br>he was well himself,and hoped it would be a good fight." The<br>men then commenced peeling. Dunn and M'Neill for Crosbie,<br>colours blue, and yellow spot. Reynolds and M'Gee for York?<br>crimson, and white spot. Betting even.<p>Round 1. After some cautious sparring, Crosbie made feint,<br>Robinson hit left on the listener, and Crosbie staggered nearly<br>down, recovered, and came smiling up to scratch, but was floored<br>by one-two, on the upper part of the head, that dropt him.<p>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  Crosbie dashed for the upper works of his antagonist; Robin-<br>son parried and broke ground&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  Crosbie next made a visit to  the<br>victualling officie, and it told slightly, but Robinson rallied, closed,<br>and threw his man a severe cross buttock.<p>3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On Crosbie's coming to the scratch, the claret was seen slight-<br>ly trickling down from his left lug.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Robinson received a left hand-<br>ed hit on the works that crimsoned the velvet.?Dunn cried out,<br>" First blood ;" but Robinson pointed with his finger to his antagon-<br>ist's listener.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Crosbie broke into a rally, and received some severe<br>hits about the neck, was closed, and thrown.<p>4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Crosbie made play for the body without effect.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Robinson<br>retaliated, by unmercifully administering the pepper box on the mug<br>of his antagonist: it was claretted all  over, and, a grand finale to<br>the round.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Robinson caught hold of his man and threw him with<br>a terrific cross buttock.<p>5.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  Crosbie sported an ugly cut  under  his left ogle, the right in<br>deep mourning, and the snuff box and potatoc trap  very much the<br>worse fore wear; yet he came smiling and as pleasant as if at play,<br>his pluck was the admiration of the ring; for any person could see,<br>even at this period of the fight, that he had no chance whatever, but<br>his brave  heart seemed to soar above the storm  that was  pelting<br>round his head ; he dashed in and drew claret  slightly from under<br>Robinson's eye, but was floored by a left and right.<p>6.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  Robinson broke into a rally with both hands in distance,<br>and, after giving some severe punishment, dropt his man.<p>7.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The same as last.<p>8.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  Crosbie hit right and left, but stopped by Robinsod, tried it<br>again, and again foiled and returned on severely.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A rally, both<br>down in a struggle for the throw.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In falling they came down near<br>Reynolds' legs, and Crosbie's seconds called out foul, and said Rey-<br>nolds had saved Robinson from the severity of the fall, by placing<br>his knee in the way; but the umpires declared they did not see any<br>thing of the kind.<p>9.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Robinson rallied right and left, hit his man to all directions<br>of the ring.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In fact, Crosbie was  so chanceried that he  did not<br>know what he was doing, and sometimes turned his back to&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;his<br>man.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He was sent down in a most distressed state.<p>10.  Crosbie's daylights at this period of the battle were of little<br>use, and from the exertions he had made to turn the fate of war, he<br>merely came up (almost mechanically), his nature not allowing him<br>to speak the dreadful word....enough !<p>11.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Robinson seemed resolved not to lose the advantage he had<br>gained, for he milled his antagonist against the ropes, and from there<br>to the middle of the ring and back again.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Indeed, it appeared like<br>Harlequin and the bat of magic milling the clown.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Poor Crosbie<br>was again floored,<p>12.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Robinson again at work like a cooper round a cask.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Cros-<br>bie dropt as if shot.<p>13th and last round....Robinson would not give a half chance<br>away, and went in as if he had just begun. Crosbie was again<br>grassed in a manner that excited one general opinion....and that was<br>that he ought to be taken away at the conclusion of the round.<br>Crosbie's second said he should fight no more. Reynolds instantly<br>thre w up the skull shalck, and Robinson, in a style that would have<br>done, honour to a veteran pugilist, kindly shook hands with his<br>fallen opponent, and expressed a hearty wish that he might soon<br>recover from the effects of the battle.<p>Printed for ALEXANDER TURNBULL?Price One penny.</p>
