	<p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  EXECUTION.<p>A Genuine account of the execution of<br>Thomas Black, who was, executed at<br> Edinburgh this day for Housebreaking<br>with a sketch of his life and transac-<br>tions since his infancy,<p>This day, (10th Dec. )Thomas Black was brought up to un-<br>dergo the awful sentence of the law at the head of Libberton<br>Wynd, Edinburgh, for breaking into a house in the parish of<br>south Leith, along with John Reid. Reid has got a respite<br>during his Majesty's pleasure.<p>Since this unfortunate young man's condemnation, he has<br>evinced, we understand, a most becoming sense of his melan-<br>choly saituation, as well as the deepest contrition for his dissolute<br>habits of life. A few weeks ago he requested to be indulged<br>with a separate cell, as the society of his companions in misery<br>led to conversations on their former way of life, which served<br>to interrupt his more serious reflections, and to divert his mind<br>from those important considerations which his awful situation<br>was so powerfully calculated to excite. A respite for his fel-<br>low-sufferer who is somewhat yeunger, was received last week.<br>It can be no impeachment of the generosity of Black, or of the<br>sincerity of his repentance, to find that this act of mercy to an-<br>other, awakened in him all that love of life which had seeming-<br>ly been extinguished for ever. He sunk into a state of the<br>most heartless despondency for some time, and he could neither<br>think of the present nor of the future without the most agoniz-<br>ing feelings. During 2 days he scarcely tasted food. His mind,<br>however, was restored to its wonted tranquillity, and he ex-<br>pressed himself with calmness and resignation on the subject of<br>his approaching fate, an event to which he looked forward as<br>inevitable.<p>The Scaffold was erected as usual during Tuesday night.<br>and about seven o'clock next morning numbers were assembl-<br>ed and had taken their stance, near to the palling around the<br>scaffold. About half past eight, the melancholy groupe were<br>seen advancing slowly up Libberton Wynd, attended by the<br>Magistrate, city officers, and a strong guard of police officers;<br>the unhappy criminal was betwixt and in earnest conversation<br>with the Clergymen.<p>After mounting the seaffold, Black scarcely looked on the<br>immense multitude that was gathered around him ; one of the<br>clergymen gave a most impressive prayer, during which, and<br>a psalm which was sung, Black payed the greatest attention.<br>Having ascended the drop, the executioner commenced adjust-<br>ing the rope, and after a few minutes spent in private prayer,<br>he dropped the signal, and the drop immediately fell. The<br>struggles were very few.<p>Black was of a slender make, and was 18 and a half years<br>of age, he called himself only 17 years old when on his trial,<br>he spent his early years in Campbell's close, Canongate,<br>and was employed in drawing cords for weavers. His father<br>was formerly a farmer's servant, and his mother on removing<br>from the Canongat'e to the Cowgate some years ago, kept a<br>house of rather a loose character. She died in the Cowgate<br>and left him and a brother to the mercy of the world, exposed<br>to all its temptations, from the want of precept as well as ex-<br>ample ; his father having separated from the family some time<br>before. Moved by that pity which circumstances such as these<br>are calculated to excite, wha can but drop a tear for the mis-<br>fortunes of this unhappy youth, who has this day terminated<br>his mortal career the hand of a public executioner.<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
