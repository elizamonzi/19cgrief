	<p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A Leith Smack <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Lost.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <p><p>A Full and Particular Account of the<br>COMET, a fine Smack belonging to<br>the London and Edinburgh Shipping-<br>Company of Leith, on her passage<br>from London, on the morning of Tues-<br>day last, on Yarmouth Sands; with the<br>Wonderful preservation of the Passen-<br>gers and Crew, and their astonishing<br>Sufferings, and extraordinary escape,<br>when the Vessel sunk in deep water,<p>WE are  sorry to  state that the smack Comet,<br>Richards, belonging to the London and<br>Edinburgh Shipping Company of Leith, was lost on<br>her passage from London on the morning of Tues-<br>day last, in consequence of having struck on a sunk-<br>en wreck, on the outside of Yarmouth Sands.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The<br>accident happened about 2 o'clock in the morning ;<br>and  the damage received  by the shock was such&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>that  the vessel  sunk in deep water in little more<br>than ten minutes.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Happily the  crew, and  three<br>passengers, a gentlemen and 2 ladies, got safe into<br>the long-boat before the smack went down, which<br>she did a few  minutes after they left her.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The 3<br>passengers made a naraow escape ; the 2 ladies be-<br>ing asleep in the cabin at the time of the accident,<br>and through the exertions of some of the crew, were<br>wrapped in blankets and hurried upon deck in their<br>bed clothes, when the  water  was up to the cabin<br>table.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The gentleman  passenger, a Mr Dundas,<br>escaped a still more imminent danger, having fallen<br>into the  sea while passing from the vessel to the<br>boat.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He was, however, fortunately picked up by<br>the crew ; but in this uncomfortable condition the<br>whole company remained in  the long boat till 6<br>o'clock in the  morning, when  they got on board<br>the  floating light anchored  on  Newark Sand, of<br>Lowestoffe, after being tossed about for four hours<br>in a boisterous sea, which every minute threatened<br>to engulph them, as it had done their ill-fated ves-<br>sel.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the course of Tuesday they were all safely<br>landed at Yarmouth.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The  cargo of the Comet is<br>understood  to be of considerable value ; and very<br>little of it is said to be insured. All the losses which<br>have occurred of London and Leith smacks, within<br>the last sixteen years, have been very nearly on the<br>same spot, and in every case they have sunk in deep<br>water; thus affording strong presumption that the<br>statements of their crews, as to the accidents hap-<br>pening on sunken wrecks, instead of on the sand-<br>banks, are correct. Indeed, in the case of  the De-<br>light, which was lost last year, the breach which<br>was made in her hull was near the surface of the<br>water, and evidently made by the mast or bowsprit<br>of a sunken vessel. It is to be regretted that some<br>plan has not yet been devised, by which those<br>wrecks can be successfully raised.</p>
