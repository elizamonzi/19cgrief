	<p> EXECUTION.<p>A Full and Particular account of the Execution of W. BURKE,<br>who was hanged at Edinburgh on Wednesday the 28th<br>January, 1829; also, an account of his conduct and<br>behaviour since his condemnation, and on the Scaffold.<p>Early on Wednesday morning, the Town of Edinburgh was filled with an immense<br>croud of spectators, from all places of the surrounding country, to witness the execution<br>of a Monster, whose crime stands unparalleled in the annals of Scotland : viz.?for cruelly<br>murdering Margery M'Conegal, and afterwards selling her body to the Doctors in Octo-<br>ber last.<p>Whilst this unhappy man was under sentence, he made the following Confession:?that<br>he had been engaged in this murderous traffic from Christmas, 1827, until the murder of<br>the woman Docherty, or M'Conegal, in October last; during which period, he had but-<br>chered Sixteen of his fellow-creatures, and that he had no accomplice but Hare,?that<br>they perpetrated these fearful atrocities by suffocation. When they succeeded in making<br>their victims drunk, the one held the mouth and nostrils, whilst the other went upon the<br>body, and in this manner was the woman Docherty killed; they then sold her body to<br>Doctor ??in his rooms, and received payment at his house?and that they were<br>never Resurrectionests; all the bodies they sold being murdered, except one, who died<br>a natural death in Hare's house.<p>At an early hour on Tuesday, he was taken in a coach from the jail on the Calton-hill<br>to the Lock-up, a prison immediately adjacent to the place of execution. He spent the<br>day in silence, reading, and devotion, and on Tuesday night he slept soundly for several<br>hours. About seven o'clock, the two Catholic clergymen arrived, and were admitted into<br>the cell, and they were soon after followed by the Rev. Mr Marshall: The religious cer-<br>emonies being performed, he talked firmly, declared that death had no terrors, and expres-<br>sed a hope of pardon and happiness. During the night, Burke stated that he was happy,<br>that he had at last been arrested in his career of crime, and brought to justice. Though<br>he had been a great offender, yet he rested on the atonement of the Saviour for salvation.<br>When the irons were knocked off, he exclaimed, " Thank God these are off, and all will be<br>off shortly." Shortly after eight o'clock, the procession set out for the place of execution.<br>Bailies Crichton and Small, with a party of town officers, first ascended the scaffold,<br>and they were followed by Burke, supported by the two Catholic Clergymen. He was<br>dressed in decent black clothes, and was perfectly firm and composed. The moment he<br>appeared, the crowd set up an appalling shout, which continued for several minutes. The<br>murderer and the Catholic clergymen then knelt down and spent a few minutes in devotion,<br>and the religious exercises were concluded by a prayer from the Rev. Mr Marshall. As<br>soon as the executioner proceeded to do his duty, the cries of " Burke him, Burke him,<br>give him no rope," and many others of a similar complexion, were vociferated in voices<br>loud with indignation. Burke, in the mean time, stood perfectly unmoved, and gazed<br>around till the cap was drawn over his face, and shut the world for ever from his view.<p>The executioner having completed his preparations and placed the signal in Burke's<br>hand, the magistrates, ministers, and attendants left the scaffold. The crowd again set up<br>another long and loud cheer, which was followed by cries for " Hare, Hare!" " Where is<br>Hare ? " " Hang Hare!" and so on. Burke lifted his hands and ejaculated a" prayer of a<br>few sentences?then dropt the napkin, and momently the drop fell. The struggle was<br>neither long nor apparently severe; but at every convulsive motion, a loud huzza arose<br>from the multitude, which was several times repeated even after the last agonies of human-<br>ity were past. During the time of the wretched man's suspension, not a single indica-<br>tion of pity was observable among the vast crowd?on the contrary, every countenance<br>wore the lively aspect of a gala day, while puns and jokes on the occasion were freely<br>bandied about, and produced bursts of laughter and merriment, which were not confined<br>to the juvenile spectators alone?" Burke Hare too !" " Wash blood from the land ! " " One<br>cheer more '" and similar exclamations, were repeated in different directions, until the<br>culprit was cut down, about nine o'clock, when one general and tremendous huzza closed<br>the awful exhibition?and the multitude immediately thereafter began to disperse.<p>Burke's body is to be dissected, and his Skeleton to be preserved, in order that pos-<br>terity may keep in remembrance his atrocious crimes.<p>PRICE ONE PENNY.</p>
