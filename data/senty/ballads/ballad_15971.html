	<p> SALE OF<p>A&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;WIFE.<p>A full and particular Account of the Sale of a<br>Woman, named Mary Mackintosh, which look<br>place on Wednesday Evening, the 16th of July,<br>1828, in the Grass Market 'of Edinburgh, ac-<br>cused by her Husband of being a notorious<br>Drunkard; with the Particulars of the bloody<br>Battle which took place afterwards.<p>ON Wednesday evening last, in the Grass-market, Mary Mackintosh was<br>brought down about six o'clock by her husband, for the purpose of being<br>sold. Her crime was drunkenness and adultery. She was held by a straw<br>rope tied round her middle, and the words, " To be sold by public auction"<br>in front of her bosom. Several thousand spectators were assembled to wit-<br>ness this novel occurrence. John F------n, pensioner, and knight of the ham-<br>mer, commenced business, but the acclamations of the people were so great,<br>that no one could get a hearing for ten minutes, to bid for the unfortunate<br>Woman;<p>When, the crowd got a little quiet the people began to examine the<br>countenance of the woman ; a Highland Drover stepped through the crowd,<br>and pulled out his purse, and Said, " She be a good like lassie,'l will gi'e ten<br>and twenty shillings for her." This caused great cheering among the<br>crowd?then a stout Tinker made a bolt into the crowd, and said she should<br>never go to the Highlands?he then bid sixpence more for her. At this time,<br>one of the KlLLARNEY PIG JOBBERS, with his mouth open as wide<br>as a turnpike gate, and half drunk, eried loudly, FAUGHAHOLLICE , I will<br>give two shillings more, for she is a pratty woman. A Brogue maker,<br>from Newry, coining out of a public house; as drunk as 5O cats in a wallet,<br>came up to the Killarney man, and hits him in the bread bag, and he lay<br>there for the space of ten minutes, which made the woman for sale, laugh<br>heartily, and the cheers of the crowd at this time was long and incessant.?<br>The Brogue-maker being a supposed friend to the woman, went up to the<br>auctioneer,and told him there were three bidders: he was so enraged, he<br>knocked the auctioneer down, and made his claret flow desperately. Great<br>cheering among the people, at the expense of the knight of the hammer.?<br>The women of the neighbourhood gathered to the number of 700, and arm-<br>ed themselves with stones, some threw them, and others put them in their<br>stockings and handkerchiefs, and made a general charge through the mob,<br>knocking every one down that came in their way, until they got up to the<br>auctioneer, when they scratched and tore his face in a dreadful manner, in<br>consequence of the insult the fair sex had received. One resolute woman<br>came up with a stone and knocked down Thomas M.Guisgan, husband to<br>the woman who was exposed for sale. This woman, a true female hero,<br>and a SWEEP'S WIFE, displayed great courage in favour of her sex, and<br>said I will learn you to auction your wife again, you contaminated villain<br>Tom returned the blow, and hit her between the eyes, and made them like<br>two October cabbages. The sweep seeing his wife struck, made a sally with<br>his bag and scrapper ; the women all took the sweep's part, and cried with<br>a loud voice, mill him the old boar, a general battle ensued, and only for<br>the interference of the police, there would have been lives lost. Alter the<br>disturbance was quelled, the husband insisted she should be sold. She was<br>brought up again, and the auctioneer declared that if he could not be pro-<br>tected, be would have no more call to her. Some young fellows shouted he<br>should, and the sale began again. An old pensioner, a Jack tar, stepped<br>forward, saying, damn my tarry top-lights and chain plates she is a tight<br>little frigate, and well rigged too, and I will give half a crown more than the<br>last bidder. Well done, cried the mob to the sallor, you are a spirited fel-<br>low, and you must get her; when a farmer, who was a widower, bade two<br>pound five shillings for her, he being a friend to the sex, and the auctioncer<br>knocked her down. The farmer took her up behind him on his horse, and<br>away they went amidst the cheers of the populace.<p>W.  BOAG, PRINTER,  NEWCASTLE.<br></p>
