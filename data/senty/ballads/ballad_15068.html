	<p> DEATH OF Dr. LIVINGSTONE.<p>PRICE ONE PENNY.<p>Copies of this popular production can always<br>be obtained at the POET'S Box, 80 London Street, Glasgow<p>.<p>Tune.?Original.<p>Since making songs is all the rage I thought I'd try my hand,<br>And bring before you something new,but you must understand <br>It's not about a charming girl, of whom so many authors write,<br>Nor yet about a howling swell that likes to prowl at night;<br>It is about a great man who is now dead and gone,<br>I 'm sure you all know who I mean, the great Dr. Livingstone ;<br>When he began to push his way he was as poor as you or I ,<br>So you see what a working lad can do if he only likes to try.<p>This great man as a piecer boy at first began to work,<br>And I'm sure he always did his best, and his duty ne'er did shirk<br>For the lad who does not do his duty well in life he ne'er succeeds,,<br>For it's not by words that he is judged, but always by his deeds.<br>Through reading of great travellers' lives he thought he'd like to<br>roam,<br>And so he left old Scotia's shore, his own dear native home,<br>And crossed the wild and stormy waves to Africa's distant land,<br>To teach unto her dark-skinned sons the Gospel truth so grand.<p>While there he heard of many tribes who white men ne'er had seen,<br>Far, far across the burning sands where white men ne'er had been, <br>So he risked his life amongst them, their country to explore,<br>Crossed burning sands and fertile lands to Lake 'Nyassa's shore.<br>He made many  friends amongst them, and was the friend of all,<br>And tried to free their country from slavery's cursed thrall ;<br>He raised his voice against those men who make the negroes slaves, <br>And tear them from  their peaceful homes to toil across the  waves,<p>He was many times reported dead, and often was stricken down,<br>But great success was known his labour for to crown;<br>When last he sailed for Africa and left old Scotia's shore,<br>We did not think at that time we would ne'er see him more<br>He was again reported dead, and Stanley took the route<br>He persevered and toiled hard until he found him out ?<br>But he has died on Afric's sands, with none to raise his head<br>No loving friend to shed a tear or smooth his dying bed.<p>PRINTING.<p>Business Cards, Circulars,<br>Handbills,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Invoica&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tops,<br>Letter Heads,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Memoranda,<br>1s per 100.<p>Concert & Assembly Cards,<br>Bills, and Posters, of every description, &c., &c.,<br>at proportionately Low Prices.<p>Orders, by letter, from the country, will receive<br>immediate attention, and will be sent off by Rail,<br>Steamer, 'Bus, or Post, as may be most convenient.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
