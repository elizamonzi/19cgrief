	<h2>Transcription</h2>
	<p> A particular Account  of the comical-Wedding of &Mary<br>Ritchie, a YOUNG&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;MAId of 45, and Peter Murphy, a ,<br>lusty YOUTH of 73, which took place on Thursday last <br>in a Village near Edinburgh, after being put off for two<br>Years, for fear of a family in the Time of Scarcity; ?to<br>which is added an Account of a bloody Battle that was <br>fought at the End of the Marriage Feast, with 4 List of<br>blue Eyes, bloody Noses, scratched Face, and damaged<br>Wigs, that appeared at the End of he Engagement.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <p>A Person at Edinburgh, in writing to an acquaintance<br>here, says?" It is my constant custom, when any<br>droll affair occurs in this part of the country, to give you<br>an account of it for your entertainment, although, I can-<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;not help observing, you are at no pains- to return the com-<br>pliment.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <p>" Last week, according to promise, I went to dine with<br>a friend, who lives a few miles distant from this city. The<br>day was fine, and as I was in no great haste, I enjoyed my <br>self in viewing the delightful prospect on every side, and the<br>beautiful appearance of the country in general. But just as<br>I got to the top of a steep hill that commands the view of <br>a saug little village, near which my friend resides, I saw a<br>large assembly of men, women, and children, whose merry<br>gestures and loud exclamations soon raised my curiosity,and <br>I quickened my pace to be a nearer spectator of the fun that<br>was going on in this merry assembly.<p>" When I came up to them I soon understood it was a<br>couple that had just been married, and were returning to the<br>village to celebrate the wedding; that their ages put toge-<br>ther amounted to 115; that the happy union had been post-<br>poned two years for fear of a family in the time of the dearth,<br>and had now been agreed to on account of the Meal falling<br>to 2s. a peck, and the great prospect of plenty.<p>"I communicated this agreeable information to my<br>friend, and, in the evening, away we went to the wedding,<br>which was held in a large barn. A ll expences attending this<br>merry meeting being defrayed by a regular contribution,<br>every body was welcome, and we soon got admittance?the <p>fare was cheese, bread, beer, and whiskey in abundance.<p>It is impossible to describe the diversion that ensued when<br>the liquor began to operate?one group dancing?another <br>scolding, and a third singing, every man his own song?<br>one roaring out Dainty Davie, a second Maggy Lauder, and<br>a third Lango Lee. In this scene of merriment and con-<br>fusion the bridegroom was no idle spectator- with all the<br>gayiety of twenty-one he entertained his ancient bride with<br>the song of<p>" Hey for a lass and a bottle to cheer",<br>" And a thumping banding every year."<br>"While she returned his favours with all the airs of blushing<br>Fifteen.?This was all very well, but the scenesoon changed<p>from mirth to madness.<p>" It seems two married women began to quarrel about <p>the virtue of their daughters, when one threw a  mug of<p>beer in the other's face, which at the same time went into<p>another's bosom, and sprinkled an old crusty fellow who<p>was smoking his pipe?he suspecting a young fellow that<p>had been vexing him before, immediately threw the con-<p>tents of the jug that stood next him in his face, which Wet<p>every person near him-over went the table?out went the<p>lights, and a general battle ensued?candlesticks, jugs, hats,<p>wigs, caps, and handkerchiefs were flying in every direction,<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  ?the young girls squeeling?the men swearing, and the<p>Old women crying murder:?When this affair was over and<p>lights procured, it is impossible to describe the appearance<p>of the company?but such a number of bald heads, bloody<p>noses, bare necks, and scratched faces, I never beheld."<p>T. Duncan, Printer, Saltmarket.</p>
