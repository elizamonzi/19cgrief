	<p> Awful Judgment.<p>A Full and Particular Account of the Dreadful Pu-<br>nishment inflicted on Mr JOHN SYM, a Respec-<br>table Gentleman in Hampstead, who was in a mo-<br>ment struck Blind  by Lightning, for giving False<br>Evidence against his own Servant Maid, by which<br>she was condemned to Death, but was afterwards<br>providentially saved by his voluntary Confession at<br>the place of Execution,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  <br>MR JOHN SYM, born in the Town and Parish of Hampstead,<br>a Batchelor of about 40 years of age, having a good Estate  about<br>£120 a-year of his own, and let out the most part of it, only keep-<br>ing the house and gardens in his own possession.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He kept a ser-<br>vant maid in his house whose name  was Mary Small, one of the<br>same Parish, and about 22 year; of age.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Her Master having been<br>abroad at a neighbour's house  about a mile distant from his own,<br>and drinking very hard, came home about ten o'clock at night,<br>when finding the maid in his chamber  making the bed,  he asked<br>her, why she had not done it before that time of night, and she<br>told him she had been about other business.<p>She being a very handsome young woman, her master took her<br>in his arms and threw her upon the bed, swearing he would lie<br>with her, but she strove with all her strength to prevent him, so<br>that he had not his desire. She in struggling lost the key of her<br>trunk out of her bosom, and going down stairs her master found<br>it, and put it into his pocket. He went the next day to a smith's<br>shop, and had another key made by it, and afterwards put the<br>maid's in her chamber window, and when he came down he be-<br>gan to be rude with her, offering her great rewards if she would<br>consent to lie with him. She told him, that she thought he had<br>not been such a person, and if he offered such incivilities again she<br>would leave his service.<p>He being afraid she would tell the neighbours of his actions,<br>sent her to a farm house about a mile from his own on an errand,<br>and while she was absent, took his key and opened her trunk put-<br>ting in six Gold Rings, four silver spoons, and a silver cup, and<br>shut her trunk again. When the maid returned, he began again<br>to offer incivilities, on which she insisted on her wages, telling him<br>she would not stay another moment in his service. He swore he<br>would not pay a farthing ; so she takes her trunk and carries it to<br>a neighbour's house, desiring to leave it there till she went to a Jus-<br>tice to get a warrant to make her master pay her wages.<p>The people where the maid left her trunk told her master of it,<br>who presently took horse and rode to a Justice where he found the<br>maid making her complaint that her master would not pay her her<br>wages.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  The Justice asked him why he did not pay her ?  He said,<br>sir, I am glad I have found her here, for she has broken open my.<br>chest, and has taken away six gold rings, four silver spoons and a<br>silver cup, and carried them off.<p>The Justice asked the maid what she had done with the above-<br>mentioned goods which her master had charged her with ? When<br>the poor maid with tears in her eyes, answered him, and said, that<br>she never had seen any such things all the time she had lived in<br>his house ; but, at the desire of her master, her trunk was sent for<br>and opened before the Justice, in which they found the goods above-<br>mentioned. Hereupon she was committed to prison, and at the en-<br>suing Sessions brought to her trial. When she was at the bar, her<br>wicked master swore positively, that she had broke open his chest<br>and feloniously carried away the aforesaid goods. In short, he lay<br>so hard against her, and the things, as it were, found upon her, that<br>she was brought in guilty, and received sentence of death.<p>Wednesday the 3d of April being the day of Execution, after prayers and a Psalm,<br>being sung as usual, she mounted the ladder, and a rope being placed about her neck,<br>the Minister then asked her whether she was guilty of the fact for which she was<br>going to suffer or not ? She answered that she was as innocent as the child unborn;<br>then she said to the Executioner, when you see me drop my handkerchief, do your<br>office. Then casting her eyes around, she saw her master and desired to speak with<br>him, but he refused to come to her ; then the Sheriff went to him and desired him<br>to speak to the prisoner; when he came she said Lord, master, don't your conscience<br>strike you to see me going to die this shameful death, for a thing that I am not guilty<br>of? Her master swore she was guilty, and desired God to make him an example if<br>she was not, and further said, that what he had sworn against her was as true as that<br>God was in Heaven. The prisoner said, the Lord turn your conscience ; I do<br>freely forgive you, as I hope to be forgiven in the world to come. ln less than two<br>minutes after, there were heard three dreadful claps of thunder, and a flash of fire<br>that struck her master down at the place of execution. He by a quarter of an hour<br>speechless; then, when he came to himself, he cried out, I find the heavy hand of<br>the Lord is upon me ; It was I that put the gold and silver articles into the maid's<br>trunk, because she would not consent to lie with me.<p>His eye sight is taken from him, his flesh is rotting off his bones as a just judge-<br>ment against false witnesses. In brief, the Sheriff respiting the execution till the<br>Court was informed of this wonderful discovery, the poor girl was saved from the<br>jaws of death, and part of her master's estate seized, to make her satisfaction for the<br>loss of her time and credit.<p>PRICE ONE PENNY.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Menzies,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Printer.</p>
