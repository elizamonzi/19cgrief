	<p> Execution at Perth.<p>An account of the Execution of HANS REGELSON, a Danish seaman, who was executed<br>in front of the Council-Room, Perth, on Friday the 28th of June, 1811, pursuant to<br>his sentence, for committing a Rape on Margaret Budge, of Burntisland, aged 17.?<br>Also, an account of his Behaviour on the Scaffold.<p>ON Friday Hans Regelson, the  danish<br>seaman, aged about twenty-five, who<br>Was capitally condemned, at the last Perth<br>Circuit, for a rape, committed on Margaret<br>Budge, of Burntisland, aged 17, was exe-<br>cuted at Perth, pursuant to his sentence.<p>The fate of this unhappy foreigner ex-<br>cited a very general sympathys and every at-<br>tention was paid him during his confine-<br>ment that could be bestowed on a person in<br>his situation, for which he seemed exceeding<br>grateful.<p>From the report of the Clergymen who<br>attended him, we are happy to hear he was<br>remarkably penitent and resigned. Indeed,<br>he could not but be convinced of the justice<br>of his sentence; for the Court, during his<br>trial supplied him with every lawful advan-<br>tage for his defence that possibly could be en-<br>joyed by a British subject?able counsel was<br>appointed for him, and every exculpatory<br>plea listened to with more than usual anxiety,<br>that the Jury, without a breach of duty,<br>might be enabled to acquit him.<p>On Friday morning he received the sa-<br>crament according to the forms of the<br>Church of England, which are nearly simi-<br>lar to those of the Lutherian Church, of<br>which he was a member.<p>He Came on the platform at the usual<br>hour, apparently firm and resigned, and be-<br>trayed no symptom of fear while the execu-<br>tioner was making the necessary arrange-<br>ments?not seemed to wish to delay his fate;<br>for, whenever the executioner left him, he<br>placed himself in a supplicating attitude,<br>dropped the fatal signal, and was immedi-<br>ately suspended.<p>The sympathy of the spectators for this<br>unfortunate foreigner was very apparent,<p>and they expressed their feelings when he<br>made his exit by a universal ejaculation of<br>pity, in a low and mournful tone of voice.<p>Early in the month of February laft, as a<br>Dragoon was on his return from duty, to his<br>quarters, a&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;small public- house, called. Bran-<br>dean Hut, in the forest, near Petersfield,<br>in Hampshire, (England) his attention was<br>arrested by the Cries of some person in distress,<br>which induced him to ride up to the spot<br>whence they proceeded, where his humanity<br>was shocked on beholding a woman tied to a<br>tree, with the tears, which her situation and<br>sufferings had produced, actually frozen to<br>her cheeks, and, shocking to relate. quite<br>naked, having been Stripped and robbed of<br>every article or her dress,by two villains,<br>who afterwards left her in that deplorable<br>condition. The Dragoon instantly cut the<br>cords that bound her hands and feet to the<br>tree; and having, in some measure, restored<br>to her the use of her limbs, by rubbing<br>them, wrapped her up in his cloak, placed<br>her on his horse, and proceeded to his<br>quarters, where he soon after arrived; and,<br>as he was conducting the shivering object of<br>his care into the house she looked through<br>a window that commanded a view of the<br>kitchen, suddenly shrunk back and in a<br>faint voice exclaimed, " there are the two<br>men that robbed me of my all, and used me<br>so cruelly!" The soldier, in consequence,<br>entered the kitchen, and secured the men,<br>who were the next day taken before a Magi-<br>strate; and, after the necessary examination,<br>committed to Winchester jail, for trial at the<br>next Assizes. The woman, we need hardly<br>say, was taken proper care of; and the Dra-<br>goon, we hope, will be properly rewarded<br>for his exertions in the cause of humanity<br>and justice.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<p>Printed by Thomas Duncan 159, Saltmarket,</p>
