You know the last time we rode together we<br>were annoyed by those drunken scoundrels who ever<br>and anon disturbed our mutual conversation, but now<br>everything bids fare for an undisturbed and pleasant<br>interview between us, which I hope will turn out to our<br>mutual advantage. I was very uneasy the last time we<br>were together, thinking your mamma would bring you<br>to a strict account about where you were so very late<br>that night. I had a very remarkable dream that night<br>which left me very uneasy about you, thinking that all<br>our secrecy was found out by your mamma.<p>She-Dear Thomas, the thing was managed very<br>well on my part, if a soliciter had been with me to give<br>me his advice on the subject, I could not have acted<br>better. I told mamma that a particular friend took me<br>to the play that night, to see a favourite piece acted,<br>Which lured all suspicion and prevented further enquiries<br>I sent you a letter last week I hope you received it, my<br>chambermaid is very attentive to me on all matters of<br>secrecy, she post's my letters carefully and with such<br>circumspection that, I am not at all frightened of de-<br>tection. Sir, when you write, address your letters to<br>the care of John Grimshaw, for Ann Fletcher, residing<br>in T--street, No. 5, and by so doing we can keep up<br>are gular correspondence undetected.<p>At this period the shrill whistle of the railway train<br>announced that the engine had arrived at it's destination<br>on alighting at the station, Thomas, took Emma by<br>the hand, and cordially shook it, saying, farewell my<br>dear Emma.<p>After the parties had left the railway carriage, two<br>ofters Were picked up, the following are correct copies<br>the same.<p>My  beloved  Angel.<p>It always adds to my happiness<br>by sensing a line to my beloved. When you write to<br>me be very circumspect and  in broken sentences. I can<br>easily understand your sentiments, least it should get<br>into the hands of my wife, whose keen penetration<br>would soon discover our intamacy. She has a sharp<br>penetrating eye. keener than the point of a tailor's<br>needle, her tongue goes faster than railway speed, and<br>if she once starts, there is no telling where she may<br>stop. Meet me on Wednesday night at the gate, you<br>know where. let the hour be eleven o'clock, when the<br>youngsters are asleep that have so frequently disturbed<br>our nightly meetings.<p>I remain my dear Emma,<p>Yours. ever affectionate.<p>Yours came safe to hand, I shall always<br>esteem it a great favour to comply with your wishes<br>and meet you at the time and place appointed. I shall<br>inform my chambermaid of our appointment, and she<br>will tell mamma if there is any enquiry, that I am<br>gone to bed, and she will be ready to let me in at any<br>hour of the night that I am at liberty. Dear Thomas,<br>our private interviews are of such a pleasing nature<br>that I would give up all other engagements in the world<br>to meet you. It is at night when on my lonely bed that<br>your winning smiles are running in my head, like water<br>through a fountain. Pleasant dreams and scenes of<br>past interviews awake me from my sleep, and relying<br>on your punctuality, you may depend on mine.<p>I remain my ever loved Thomas,<br>Yours. sincerely.</p>
