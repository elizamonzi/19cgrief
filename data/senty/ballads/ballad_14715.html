	<h2>Transcription</h2>
	<p> Public Whipping.<p>An Account of the Public Whipping of JOHN KEAN, on<br>Wednesday,  the llth of May,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1825,  for&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Laiming and<br>Wounding,with intent to Murder, JOHN GRAHAM,<br>Cotton Spinner in Barrowfield Road, on the 30th March<br>last, and who is to be transported for life.<p>GLASGOW, 11th May, 1825.<p>This day, a new plan of punishment was exhibited in this city, and which, we<br>presume would answer the purpose better on every, occasion when this degrading<br>punishment is required to Be inflicted; we mean, a public scaffold erected in front<br>of the jail, where the prisoner is placed to the view of every person who has feel-<br>ings strong enough to witness the," cat o' nine tails" applied to the back of him<br>who has injured the laws of his country, without causing that tumult and uproar<br>on the public streets, winch has been too often witnessed.<p>But we believe, it was not merely for the tranquillity of the public streets this<br>new plan was adopted, but to convince the mind of every beholder, the narrow<br>escape he had made from a scaffold, far more dreadful, and on which death would<br>have been the issue. The law of Scotland, however, does not extend so for, for<br>cases like the present; but, if practices, such as these, are persevered in, the law<br>which at present exists may be changed, and Lord Ellenborough's Act extended<br>to Scotland, which punishes with death all offences of a like kind.<p>The prisoner, who this day suffered the lashes of the public executioner, was<br>found Guilty of feloniously and maliciously discharging a pistol or more pistols,<br>with intent to murder John Graham, cotton-spinner, Barrowfield Road, whereby<br>the said person was severely and desperately wounded in the back, to the great-<br>effusion  of his blood, and the imminent danger of his life, aggravated by using<br>such means, of deterring others from following their lawful employment in safety.<p>For this offence, Kean, about 12 o'clock this day, appeared on the new scaffold,<br>and being tied up, and his back uncovered, received the lashes of the public exe-<br>cutioner,which were pretty smart, as could.be distinguished from the shrugging<br>of the prisoner ; they amounted to between 80 and 90. Sympathy seemed to be<br>excited by some, but the general conversation was, " he deserved all, as the poor<br>man whom he had wounded would be an object for life." After undergoing this<br>punishment, he was remitted back to prison, where a surgeon was in attendance<br>to afford him every aid, and where he will remain till such time as a vessel arrives,<br>when he will be conveyed, along with his fellow prisoners to Leith, and sent away<br>to some foreign country, never more to see his native shore. <p>An example, such as this, should operate as a warning to all, to keep from crime<br>of such a cowardly and dastardly nature; to way-lay a man, shoot at and wound<br>him, tor striving to gain an honest livelihood for himself and family, cannot be<br>called by aay name but cowardly; if he had not accepted the work offered him,<br>some other person would, for self preservation is the first law of nature. Cases<br>of one man filling the place of another, occur daily in manufactories and among<br>trades of all descriptions, and were all who have lost their places to way-lay, fire<br>at, and wound those who fill them, thousands in Glasgow and its neighbourhood<br>would either be killed or made cripples for life.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We hope, for the honour of this<br>country, this outrage will be the last.<p>By this tranaction, 2 families have lost their support; Graham is now unable to<br>maintain his and Kean is deprived of it; for the latter's conduct, surely the fami-<br>lies of either should not want.<p>W. Carse, Printer, Glasgow,</p>
