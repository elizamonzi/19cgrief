	<p> A Full and Particular Account of the Trial of RO-<br>BERT MURRAY, who was tried yesterday, the<br>28th Feburary, 1825, before the High Conrt of<br>Justiciary, for the Robbery of the Stirling Mail, on<br>the evening of the 18th December last, at Kirklis-<br>ton when Cash to the amount of upwards of £7000<br>Sterling was abstracted !<p>ON Monday the 28th February, 1825, ROBERT MURRAY,<br>sometime in the Naval Service of the Honourable East India<br>Company, was put to the bar, accused of being art and part con-<br>cerned in the robbery of the Stirling Mail, on the evening of the<br>18th December last, at or near the house of Mathew Linn, post-<br>master, Kirkliston, on the road leading from Linlithgow to Edin-<br>burgh, and with stealing therefrom three parcels of banker's or<br>bank notes,?one of these having been sent from the branch of the<br>Bank of Scotland, Stirling, to the office in Edinburgh, and contain-<br>ed notes to the value of £2434. 17s.?-2d, a parcel from Crieff to<br>the Commercial Banking Company, amounting to £2360,?-and,<br>3d, a parcel to the Leith Banking Company, from Callander,<br>amounting to £ 2254. 10s. The prisoner plead Not Guilty.<p>A jury being sworn, the several bank agents stated their having<br>made up the parcels of notes, which were delivered to the Guard<br>of the Mail Coach, at Stirling, William Hume was then called, who<br>deponed, that he was Guard of the Stirling Mail on the 18th De-<br>cember last, was about eight years in that situation ; was in the<br>practice of conveying notes from Stirling to Edinburgh, which was<br>a private transaction between the banks and him. After stating<br>that he got three different parcels containing notes to be delivered in<br>Edinburgh, which were put first into a sack, and placed in the Mail<br>box, on the road, two miles on this side of Falkirk, he then goes on<br>to say, that he unlocked the box at Winchburgh, without stopping<br>and put the Linlithgow bag, whieh he had previously kept in the<br>sword case, into the Mail sack. He then felt with his feet that the.<br>money parcels were still safe. He did not then lock the Mail box,<br>that was a neglect on his part. No person ever left the front of the<br>eoach to come to the back part till it reached Kirkliston. An out-<br>side passenger was taken up at Linlithgow, who sat along side the<br>coachman. The coach stopped at Kirkliston, opposite the door of<br>Matthew Linn. the postmaster ; it was very dark when the coach<br>arrived there, at 40 minutes after 6 o'clock ; witness dismounted,<br>and went into the Post Office for the bag, leaving the Mail box un-<br>locked ; he had no occasion to open the box there, not did he do so<br>till he reached Corstorphine.....He was not more than one and a<br>half minute in the house at Kirkliston, but he afterwards  assisted<br>in putting, the leading horses to the  coach.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The total amount  of<br>the whole stop, did not exceed four or five minutes including the <br>time he was in the house.<p>The Mail Box continued unlocked till he arrived at Constorphine,<br>where he got a bag to take to Edinburgh. He then opened the<br>box to put in this bag?and he discovered that the money parcels<br>were gone, having been taken out at Kirkliston. He never men-<br>tioned the loss to any one till he arrived at the Post Office ; there<br>he met the persons from the banks. Two inside passengers and<br>one outside outside were set down at Frederick Street; one of the<br>insides was the passenger who was out of the coach at Kirkliston?<br>and the outside one, was he who was taken up at Linlithgow. He<br>let them go at once, although he was aware of the robbery?from<br>being in a state of alarm and confusion, he did not well know<br>what he was doing. Did not, however, suspect any of these pas-<br>sengers, for one had no luggage whatever, and the other only a<br>small bag which lay on the fore boot, not near so large as tho par-<br>cels. When the coach arrived at the Post Office he found the usual<br>persons waiting to receive the money for the banks, and told them<br>that it was all gone. He then gave information as to when he<br>thought the robbery had been effected ; and returned to Kirkliston,<br>with some of the bank people where they received some intelligence.<br>He was quite certain that he felt the money parcels in the coach at<br>Winchburgh, and that he did not miss them till he arrived at Cor-<br>storphine. He had no participation directly or indirectly in the<br>theft, nor did he know by whom tho robbery was effected.<p>A great many other witnesses were then examined, and the pri-<br>soner's declaration read, in which he stated, that he was 39 years<br>of age, was born in London, and lived on the interest of his money.<br>After which the Jury were addressed by the Counsel for and against<br>the prosecution, as well as by the Lord Justice Clerk, when they,<br>without leaving their box, returned a viua voce verdict, finding the<br>Libel Not Proven, on which he was dismissed from the bar, He<br>was again taken on a new warrant, in the Parliament Square.<p>Printed for Robert M'Millan PRICE ONE PENNY.<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  </p>
