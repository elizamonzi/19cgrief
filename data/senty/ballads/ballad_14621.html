	<p> SECOND EDITION,<p>An account of the trial and sentence of Robert<br>Emond, who was tried at Edinburgh on Mondt<br>last, for the horrid murder and robbery of his<br>sister-in-law and his niece, in the village of Ab-<br>bey, near Haddington, by cutting their throats,<br>and nearly severing their heads from their body;<br>he was found guilty, and sentenced to be exe-<br>cuted at Edinburgh., on Wednesday the 17th<br>day of March next,?Glasgow  9th&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;February,<br>1830.<p>EDINBURGH, FEB, 8, 1830---This day Robert Emond was<br>placed at the bar of the High Court of Justiciary, charged with the<br>murder and robbery of Mrs. Franks and her daughter, in the vil-<br>lage of Abbey, near Haddington, in the month of October last, The<br>following are the circumstances of the case :?<p>" In the village of Abbey, which is about a mile from Haddington<br>resided a poor widow woman named Franks, and her daughter, &<br>girl of about 14 years of age.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The house  they inhabited is about<br>a hundred or a hundred and fifty yards distant from the village, and<br>is enclosed within a wall of four or five feet high.---The last  time<br>the inmates of this dwelling were seen alive was on Monday Oct.26,<br>1829.  Early on Wednesday morning, a miller belonging to the vil-<br>lage was surprised by the piteous squeaking of a pig on the widow's<br>premises. Conjecturing that the poor woman might be from be home,<br>and the animal in want of food, he was induced to go and investi-<br>gate the cause of its outcry.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Finding no  access by the gate he<br>scaled the wall, when the first object  that presented itself to his<br>horror struck gaze was the body of the widow lying in the pig-sty,<br>with her throat cut and otherwise dreadfully mangled. The miller<br>immediately alarmed the villagers, several of whom hurried to the<br>scene of death.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On entering the house they discovered the  girl<br>also a corpse, with her head severely bruised, as if by blows from<br>some heavy instrument.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It was found on examination that the wi-<br>dow's marriage ring which she constantly wore, had disappeared,<br>and that her ear-rings had been torn out of her ears.<br> <br>"Among other circumstances which had excited suspicions against<br>Emond, (brother in law to the deceased), we are informed that hav-.<br>ing married the sister of Mrs Franks  who was known to be pos<br>sessed of some property, he had entered into speculations contrary<br>to the wishes of his wife, who, in consequence, refused to supply<br>turn with money.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This enraged him to a great degree, and in the<br>course of Sunday week led to a serious quarrel between him and<br>his wife, whom  he grievously maltreated upon  the occasion, and<br>even attempted to throw in to a deep well.<p>" Another circumstance was the prints In the bloody floor of the<br>late Mrs. Frank' house, corresponding; with a pair of shoes worn<br>by him; these slices, we hear, are not likely to be matched in Scot-<br>land, or at least in the county of Haddington they were manufac-<br>tured in' Sunderland.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A shirt  with blood on the  wrist&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;was also<br>found in his house at North Berwick; this he explained by stating<br>that it received this stain while he was dressing  his  wife's head,<br>which at he wounded, and for which he expresses great regret.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But<br>in addition to this, another shirt had been found, the front of which<br>was stained with blood, as if a quantity had spouted against it, and<br>been partially washed out. There was also a print upon the breast,<br>as if a bloody hand had taken hold of it  When Emond was shown<br>this we were told he exclaimed,  O God, be merciful to me."<p>The prisoner being placed at the bar, pled Not Guilty,<br>A great number of witnesses  were examined,  the  principal of<br>whom were Robert Tait and Daniel Alexander Murray, who it will<br>be recollected stole about £300 from Mr. Campbell in Glasgow, and<br>who being confined in the same cell with Emond, had the following'<br>Conversation with him.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Tait asked him?"Did you really do it-<br>then ?&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He replied?" Oh, yes. but don't speak of it to me; for it<br>goes like s knife to my heart whenever I think of it."?[This nar-<br>rative excited a great sensation in the Court, and the prisoner, who<br>full then had maintained the greatest composure was observed to<br>quail dreadfully.]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In consequence of their becoming witnesses for<br>the crown, both these young men have got tree.<p>The Jury at half.past three o'clock on Tuesday morning, on<br>returned an unanimous verdict against the prisoner, who ,heard it<br>unmoved, although it was received by a cheer with the auditory.<p>The Lord Justice Clerk then addressed the prisoner in a very<br>feeling,and solemn manner on the atrociousness of the crime he<br>Stood charged with, that of killing a mother and her daughter, he<br>hoped and implored the prisoner for the sake of his immortal soul,<br>to make his peace with the Almighty God, Sentence of death was<br>then pronounced on him in the usual form, to be executed at Ed<br>inburgh, on Wednesday the 17th day of March next, between the<br>hours of eight and 10 o'clock in the morning.<p>John Muir printer, Glasgow<p></p>
