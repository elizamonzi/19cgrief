	<p> LAMENTATION<p>OF<p>MARY BRAID,<p>Who is to Executed at Edinburgh, on Monday the 17th day of February, and<br>her body buried within the precincts of the jail, for the unnatural crime of <br>INCEST with her Brother, (who is to be transported beyond seas for life,) <br>and the cruel and barbarous MURDER of her own child, their illicit off-<br>spring, by throwing it into the Union Canal, on the 13th of August last,<br>with a rope tied round its neck.<p>This town of late has been the seen<p>Of deeds too horrid for to name,<p>Even history blushes to afford<p>A space their occurrence to record.<p>Of heathen lands we have heard narrate<p>Foul deeds which freeze the blood to state ;<p>But lo! within this Christian land.<p>We equal deeds can now command <p>Of Burke and Hare we have all heard tell,<p>Who, murdering, did their victims sell<p>To surgeons of the first repute<p>Who thought they'd naturally died?<p>Of Emond, whom sly vengeance drew<p>To kill his sister and neice too ;<p>And Howison, who, through wanton malice,<p>At Cramond slew poor Widow Geddes<p>Besides the list of later worthies,<p>Namely, M'Court, and Gow. and Beveridge,<p>Who, to get rid each of his wife,<p>Made use of poker, tongs, of knife.<p>Though all of these they were detected,<p>And each his crime has expiated<p>By shameful death?-yet, strange to say,<p>Like deeds are acted at this day.<p>As witness now the double crime,<br>Which of the city is the theme,<br>Incest between a sister and brother,<br>Cemented too with cool child murder.<br>Sure such can  never be the effect<br>Of the high famed " march of intellect ?"<br>Say, does a people when refined<br>Lose the finer feelings of the mind ?<p>As on my bed I lay last night,<br>(Sure sleep had at me taken fright,)<br>Such thoughts upon my mind still prey'd,<br>In reference to the case of Braid.<br>Methought a Genius wan and pale<br>Transported me unto the jail <br>Through gate and wicket, 'thout key or bell,<br>He led me to the condemned cell.<p>Within the prison's darksome gloom,<br>These prisoners mourned their fated doom;<br>Their eyes were glazed, their cheeks were pale,<br>And they lifted their eyes in weeping and wail.<br>But there was one who strnck my sight,<br>Whose eye once beamed with lustre bright,<br>Though now 'twas bedimmed with many a tear.<br>As she thought on the day that was drawing near<p>As thus she sat in deep sorrow drowned,<p>Her frail body with many a chain being bound,<p>Beside her stood,in anxious thought,<p>Her brother, partner of her guilt.<p>Their looks betrayed their inward pain,<p>As they struggled a self-command to gain<p>To take a last and solemn farewell<p>Of each other they loved so fatally well.<p>At length spake the brother, while his tears ran down,<br>Farewell, dearest Mary, our time now is flown ;<br>Though death is your doom, how freely could I<br>With you exchange places, and in your stead die.<br>But, alas! I'll be hurried to a foreign land,<br>Where hard-hearted- tyrants shall o'er me command,<br>Without the least prospect of comfort or peace,<br>Till death's welcome message shall give me release.<br>Scarce able to speak, in his arms then she fell,<br>As she faulter'd these words, dear Thomas, farewell!<br>Repent of your sins, be Religion your guide,<br>And Heaven Will bless you whatever betide,<br>For me do not grieve-?I go hence in full hope<br>Of receiving free pardon through Jesus my God ;<br>In which blessed hope I trust I shall die,<br>And wake in the blessed assembly on high.<p>LAMENTATION.<p>Oh, all who hear of my sad state,<p>Oh, pity my dire case,<br>Do /?/ to an ignominious fate,<p>Deprived of human bliss.<p>Oh. if my days were to begin,<p>1 to the world would shew<br>That I would shun the paths of sin,<p>Wherein destroyers go.<p>Bin, ah ! these days are past .and gone !<p>In fetters here 1 lye,<br>Confined in a dungeon strong,<p>By men condemned to die.<p>Because God's laws I did transgress,<br>And would net walk therein ;<p>But fled the paths of righteousness<br>And trod the path of sin.<p>Tormenting thoughts oppress my heart,<p>While I think on my ways;<br>More piercing they're than sharped darts,<p>That have cut short my days.<p>And sure the vengeance it will come,<p>And on my head will full,<br>Unless that God's own holy son<p>Deliver me from, thrall.<p>O, therefore,, holy Son of God,<p>Do thou my soul relieve<br>From God's wrath and afflicting rod,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>That now my soul doth grieve.<p>On thy redemption I depend ;<p>0  cast me not away;<p>But shield my soul, and me defend<br>Against the evil day.<p>And then of death's devouring pangs<p>I will not be afraid ;<p>When then by thine own righteous laws,<br>My righteousness hast made.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>Good christians all, of every kind.<p>Who hear of my sad fate,<br>Repent, and sanctify your mind,<p>Before it is too late.<p>So that with you it may be well,<br>When you resign your breath,<p>And may with samts and angels dwell,<br>Free from the second death.<p>Remember, Lord, how short a time<p>On earth I've to remain.<br>And when I suffer for my crime,<p>May death to me be gain.<p>O let the prisoner's sighs ascend,<p>Before thy throne on high,<br>Likewise from death their souls defend<p>That are condemned to die.<p>O then give ear to what I say.<p>Seek God to be your guide;<br>Resort not with bad company,<p>And truth keep on your side.<p>For if you suffer passions strong<p>To triumph over you.<br>They'll hurry you to hell amongst<p>The lost and guilty crew,<p>Who've trampled on God's holy laws,<p>And his precepts cast behind,<br>And now thioughout eternity<p>Cannot one comfort find.<p>Sanderson, Printer, Edinburgh.</p>
