	<p> Letter from Kirkaldy.<br>DREADFUL<br>ACCIDENT<br>At Kirkaldy<p><br>By a Gallery in the Church falling down,<br>during the time the Rev, Dr Irving was<br>preaching to a crowed Audience where-<br>by a great number was killed and<br>wounded.<p>News of a most disagreeable nature  have reached<br>us from Kirkaldy this morning, and the following<br>letter was handed to us just now, by a respectable<br>Gentleman, who had received it from a friend by the<br>Steam Boat, upon making enquiry, we find that  some  <br>accident has actually  taken place last  night in that<br>quarter, and we give it publicity, hoping as the writer<br>says, that it is greatly exaggerated.<p>Kirkaldy; Monday Morning, June 16th 1828.<br>Sir-I embrace the opportunity of sending you&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;by<br>the first boat&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;this morning,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;some&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;accounts&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of  the<br>dreadful accident which happened last night, an  acci-<br>dent, which for its fatal and calamatious consequences,<br>is unparalleled  in the history of Kirkaldy.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It was in-<br>timated, latter end of last week, that the Rev. Mr<br>Erving was to preach in our church on Sunday evening,<br>which  intimation soon gained circulation&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;for&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;miles<br>round  Kirkaldy, and during Sunday&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;afternoon,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the<br>people  were seen  pouring  into&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the  town  from&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;all<br>quarters.<p>Long before the stated hour, the Church  was filled<br>to excess, and hundreds could not gain admittance.<br>The service commenced, and nothing in the least in-<br>dicated or forwarned the awful catastrophe that fol-<br>lowed.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During the service however owing  to the<br>crowded state of the Gallery, a kind of continual mov-<br>ing was going on, such as some of those that were sit-<br>ting, rising up to accommodate those that had stood  <br>some length of time.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When service was near conclud-<br>ed, a sort of crackling noise was heard, which alarm-<br>ed the people, and  caused  a general  movement, and<br>awful to relate, at this moment of confusion, part of<br>the Gallery gave way, and fell with  a  crash&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;on  the<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; devoted victims below.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A scene past describing now<br>took place, a general rush was made towards the doors<br>and many were hurt by being trampled on and press-<br>ed.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As soon as the accident was made known to  the<br>proper authorities, they rendered the greatest assist-<br>ance, those that were hurt were carefully lodged in<br>the  neighbouring  houses,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;where  medical  assistance<br>was promptly got.<p>I have not been able to ascertain the exact  number<br>of those that ware hurt, as the town is still in  a state<br>of confusion, but report  says that there are&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;thirty<br>killed, besides many that is dangerously hurt; but I<br>hope&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;this&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;account is greatly exaggerated.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I  was<br>among the fortunate number that did not gain admit-<br>tance.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; During the course of this day I will get every<br>information, and let you know.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I send this early in-<br>telligence to give you the satisfaction that there was<br>none  of our family there.<p>I am &c.</p>
