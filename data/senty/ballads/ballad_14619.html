	<p> Wonderful Case !<p>A strange and wonderful Account of a Rev. and well-<br>beloved Clergyman in London, who died a few days<br>ago, and remained in that state for eighteen hours, and<br>who after being dressed in dead clothes, and laid out<br>to be coffined, to the great surprise, terror and aston-<br>ishment of all present, started up in bed, and, at great<br>length, described the most wonderful,sights he had<br>seen, and what, he said, was to happen in the United<br>Kingdoms in a short time.<p>This REV. GENTLEMAN lived in London, and was beloved<br>by all his hearers for his kind and charitable turn, and his great care<br>of them by visiting and instructing them in what concerned their im-<br>mortal souls. But having been taken very ill, however, in the after-<br>noon's sermon, he was assisted into his house, and having laid<br>himself down in bed, he continued always getting worse, till the<br>next day, when, to all appearance, he died without pain, but went<br>away with a smile in his countenance. He was washed and dress.<br>ed according to the custom, and remained so for eighteen hours ;<br>at which time his wife and some of the elders were present, sitting<br>where the funeral was to be ordered, he started up in bed to the sur<br>prise of all present. The Minister called to them not to be afraid,<br>for though, said he, I was dead I am now alive and in my proper sen-<br>ses. O! the sights that I have seen, sit down till I relate to you what<br>I have to reveal to the world.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  <p>On the last day of last month, towards the evening, after I had<br>got all the duties of the day over, the crisis took place, I was seized<br>with a strange and indescribable quivering. A rushing sound was<br>in my ears, I saw around me innumerable strange faces ; they were<br>bright and visionary, and without bodies, and tried to move, but<br>could not. For a short time a terrible confusion overwhelmed me,<br>and when it went off, all my recollections returned with the most<br>perfect distinctness, but the power of motion departed. I heard the<br>sound of weeping at my pillow, and I heard the voice of my wife<br>say, " He is dead. " I cannot describe what I felt at these words?<br>I exerted my utmost power of volition to stir, but could not move<br>even an eyelid. After a short pause my wife sobbing and convul-<br>sed with grief, drew near me, and kissed me, and then shut my eyes<br>before she left me. I heard, (for my senes had not as yet left me)<br>by the attendants that my friends had left the room, and I soon found<br>that the undertakers were preparing to habit me in the garments of<br>the grave. Their thoughtlessness was more awful than the grief of<br>my friends. They laughed at one another as they turned me from<br>side to side, and treated what they believed to be a corpse with the<br>most appalling ribaldry. The coffin was procured and I was shortly<br>to be laid in. My wife placed my head on what was deemed its last<br>pillow, and I felt her tears drop on my face at the time. After this<br>was over and the face cloth put down, I heard no more, nor of any<br>other thing belonging to this life.<p>In my trance I was carried away through a remote valley ; I was<br>told to carry my eyes towards the left side, when, to my terror, I be-<br>held a number of people, some of whom I knew, receiving their dif-<br>ferent punishments; some of them endeavoured to haul me into<br>their den, when my soul was troubled and my heart ached, and I<br>begged pardon of him who was ready to save me from  these evil<br>ones ; when in a moment after the scene left my sight ; I then was<br>taken to see a numerous assembly drest in the most ornamental man-<br>ner, and charmed by the most melodious music, where in heaven I<br>beheld a most glorious place ; I saw St John's vision, where he saw<br>the dead both great and small stand before the Lord; when I fain<br>would have entered into heaven's gates, but I could not; they desired<br>me to go from whence I came, and tell to the people what things I<br>had seen and heard ; to tell them that I had got a sight of both good<br>and evil, and lastly, to give them an account of the commotions that<br>will shortly take place in different kingdoms of the world, and of<br>times that are near at hand for the welfare of Britain and Ireland, in<br>not having any War, but that peace and plenty will be in the land<br>for every creature. So happy will those be who takes it to heart, for<br>to remember his latter end. Far more than these things were re-<br>vealed to me, but it will not answer to put too great an explanation<br>on them altogether.<p>Having thus given the fregoing account of himself, and having de-<br>livered his commission, he stretched himself down and soon after ex-<br>pired. The whole is written according to his desire, by one of his<br>elders,<p>EDINBURGH:?Printed for Francis M'Cartney.<p><p><p></p>
