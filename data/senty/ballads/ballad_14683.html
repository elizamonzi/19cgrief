	<p> Execution.<p>OF<p>Craig & Brown.<p>FOR<p>HOUSEBREAKING.<p>A Full and Particular account of the Execution of John<br>Craig and James Brown, who suffer'd the last sentence<br>of the Law, in front of the New Jail of Paisley, for<br>Breaking into the House of Mr. Robertson, at Foxbar,<br>and stealing a quantity of Property, and ill-using the in-<br>mates : also an account of their behaviour since their tri-<br>al, and at the place of Execution.<p>An Execution in Paisley is a circumstance of very rare occurrence,<br>and may consequently be supposed to excite a much deeper degree of in-<br>terest, than in those places where they are regularly witnessed from time<br>to time with little space between. In 1765, Provan was executed at the<br>Gallowgreen of Paisley, for the murder  his wife under circumstance of<br>deep and aggravated atrocity ; since that time down to the present, a<br>period of 64 years, there has been in this town only one of these me-<br>lancholy and awful lessoos to erring humanity, This was the final exit<br>of Thomas Pott who was executed at the cross, (the former place of exe<br>ecution having been appropriated to other purposes) in 1797 for<br>housebreaking and theft, this man, with an accomplice, were tried<br>for the robbery of Gryffe Castle, in the neighbourhood of Paisley,<br>when Potts was found guilty condemned and executed as above mention-<br>ed, since which the Gallows on which Potts ended his career would have .<br>remained unemployed, had it not been required by the town of Gree-<br>nock for a similar purpose, from whence it has been removed for the<br>execution of these two unfortunate men, James Brown and John Craig,<br>who have this day in pursuance of their sentence suffered the awful pe-<br>nalty of the law. These two men we understand are natives of Ireland,<br>but have for some years been resident in Johnstone; when the affair for<br>which they suffer'd was concocted and which place they left shortly after<br>its perpetration in order to evade the hands of Justice. They were how-<br>ever both seized and brought to this country, and tried at the last assizes<br>where they were condemned for the crime of breaking into the house of<br>Mr. Robertson of Foxbar. On trial it appeared that these two unfortu-<br>nate men along with a person of the name of Stewart (who was outlawed<br>on the day of trial,) had forcibly obtained entrance to Mr. Robertson<br>who is an old man upwards of 70 living with only his sister a Lady of<br>nearly the same age.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <p>Since they were brought from  Glasgow these unfortunate men have <br>been regularly visited by Clergymen and other religious persons, and<br>have evinced a deep feeling of contrition for their crimes, giving every<br>evidence of a repentance not to be repeated of,  In course of this fore-<br>noon they were brought into the Hall and after some pious conversation<br>and prayers they were brought out to the Scaffold, dressed in a very be-<br>coming and respectable manner, from their appearance they were ear-<br>nestly supplicating the almighty for pardon, and in presence of a most<br>immense multitude they were launched into eternity.<p>Owing to Glasgow Fast happening on this day the concourse of people flocking into this<br>town, during the early part of forenoon, was enormous, while the influx from the towns and<br>villages in the west was no less numerous, presenting as a whole, one of the most immens<br>crowds even  seen in this place, on any former  occassion.<p>PRICE ONE PENNY.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
