	<h2>Transcription</h2>
	<p> A full and particular Account of the Trial and Sentence of  THOMAS UR-<br>QUHART,  Post-master,  in Kikwall, and DAVID  his son,  who both received<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  Sentence, to be hanged at Edinburgh, the 18th of October, 1797.<p>ON Monday the 4th September 1797. came on be-<br>fore the High-Court of Justiciary at Edinburgh,<br>the trial of Thomas Urquhart, late deputy postmaster<br>of Orkeny, and David Urquhart, his Son, a boy of<br>about sixteen years of age, charged with stealing or<br>feloneously abstracting letters or pockets, containing<br>gold, bank notes, promissary notes, &c. and of being<br>guilty of falsehood and forgery.<p>The libel states a number of articles charged against<br>the prisoners; but as the Lord Advocate led evidence<br>upon only three of these charges, and passed from the<br>rest, it will be unnecessary to mention more than those<br>upon which the evidence was led.<p>The first article is, that the pannels did, sometime in<br>the year, 2794, break open a letter written by James<br>Fey, a Seaman in the Royal Navy, addressed to his fa-<br>ther James Fey in Stronsay, and did take therefrom a<br>guinea, note and half a guinea in gold ; and another let-<br>ter in the same year, likewise from James Fey to his fa-<br>ther, containing one guinea in gold, or a bank note<br>for that sum, was also broke open, and the money ab-<br>stracted; and that the said letter was, in consequence<br>of a search by the Sheriff Substitue, found the escru-<br> tore of the said Thomas Urquhart.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<p>The Second article is, that, on the 16th of Novem-<br>ber 1795, May Griffin, residing in Wapping, having<br>written a letter to Stephen Muir in Stronsey, to the care<br>of John Linklater in Kirkwall she inclosed in it an or-<br>der for 51. 5s. sterl dated Morey Letter office, general<br>Post-office Nov. 16th 1795, signed Jo. Eele, payable at<br>sight to the person named in the letter; and which or-<br>der was required to be signed by the person named in<br>the letter; but the letter was broke upon, and the mo-<br>ney abstracted by Thomas Urquhart. And on the first<br>of December, Thomas Urquhart did counterfeit a re-<br> ceipt on the back of said order, bearing to be the mark<br>of Steven Muir; and that the said order for 51.5 s. was<br>transmitted by Thomas Urquhart to the general Post-<br>office, Edinburgh, as a part of the ballance due by him<br>to the revenue; and that Thomas Urquhart did, on<br>the 7th of October 1796, write a letter to Edinburgh<br>jail, to John Trail, Esq; in Sandy requesting him to<br>pay the above 51. 5s. to Steven Muir on his ac-<br>count. <p>The third charge is, that on the 1st of March 1796,<br>David Rutherford, spirit-dealer in Perth, having Wrote<br>a  letter to Alexander Walter in Shapinshaw, inclosing,<br>a guinea note, the said letter was also Opened by One or<br>other of Thomas or David Urquhart, and the note ab-<br>stracted: And Alexander Walter having made enquiry<br>with regard to the letter not having reached him, Tho-<br>mas Urquhart, alledging that the letter had been de-<br>stroyed by accident, delivered into the hands of Mr<br>George Barry, minister of Shapinshaw, a guinea note,<br>to be given to Alexander Walter.<p>The indictment being read, Thomas Urquhart pled<br>Not Guilty ; and David Urquhart pled Guilty, and sub-<br>scribed his declaration.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  <p>It was explained by the Court, that the acknowledge-<br>ment of the son should extend to such acts of theft only<br>as were charged against him.<p> The LORO ADVOCATE observed, that though the<br>young man had pled guilty, it did not preclude him<br>from examining, in the course of the trial, such evi-<br>dence as might substantiate the charge even against him.<p>The Court found the libel against Thomas Urquhart<br>relevant to infer the pains of law ; and allowed a proof<br>of all  facts and circumstances which might tend to ex-<br>culpate or alleviate his guilt.<p>The first witness called was Robert Nicholson, Sheriff-<br>substitute of Orkney, who deposed, that in the month of<br>July 1796, he had occasion to search the house of the<br>pannel Thomas Urquhart, where he found two letters,<br>the one addressed to Dr Balfour, the other to James<br>Fey, which he identified; that he found Dr Balfour's<br>in a box in the office where letters are kept; that, on<br>scarching the box, he perceived Thomas Urquhart con-<br>ceal the letter to Dr Balfour in his  hand and begged<p>that the witness would drop it; that Dr Balfour's letters<br>was sealed ; the other was open ; that the letter to Fey<br>was concealed in an inner-keeping of Thomas Ur-<br>quhart's clcrutore. Being shown a money-order, with<br>a receipt on the back, the witness said, the  writing on<br>the back was very like the writing of the pannel Tho-<br>mas Urquhart, which he had often occasion  see; that,<br>when he searched the pannel's house, the pannel seem-<br>ed a good deal agitated, as well as when he emitted a<br>declaration before the witness.<p> George Barr, minister of Shapinshaw, remembers of<br>Alexr. Walter calling on him in the month of April<br>1796, and mentioned a letter to him about money ; that<br>the witness advised Walter to enquire at the post-ofiice<br>about it; that Walter returned and told him there was<br>no letter; that the witness soon after wrote a letter to<br>Mr Urquhart; that some short time after, Mr Urqu-<br>hart called upon him himself; that the prisoner inform-<br>ed the witness that Mrs Urquhart with a child in her<br>arms, having gone to the place where the letters were<br>lying, the child took up some of the letters, and tore<br>one of them to pieces, and among the pieces she ob-<br>served something like the fragments of a note ; but as<br>it was a pity the man should lose it, Mr Urquhart gave<br>the witness a note ; that the witness observed to the<br>pannel, that the story was not very probable, but as the<br>man had got the money, it did not signify.<p>Thomas Urquhart, minister of Rosskeen, said he is<br>acquainted with the prisoners ; that he had a conversa-<br>tion with Thomas Urquhart, in July 1796; that the<br>prisoner told him a great misfortune had happened in<br>his family last night,-his eldest boy had opened a letter,<br>containing 30l. to a merchant in Edinburgh. that his<br>son had transcribed the letter, put in the money, and<br>transmitted it to the person to whom it was addressed;<br>that his son had also opened a letter contain-<br>ing a guniea addressed to a man in the north, that some<br>of the young children had afterwards tore the letter ;<br>and that Mr Urquhart told the witness he had given a<br>guinea to Mr Barre, to give to the man ; that the pan<br>nel seemed much agitated, and asked the witness what<br>he should do ; and the witness answered, that in a case<br>of such consequence he could not advise him; that at<br>the desire of Thomas Urquhart, the witness carried<br>the young man David, with him to his house, where<br>he remained two or three days, and then went aboard<br>a ship for London; that he thinks the receipt on the<br>back of the money-order is of the hand writing of the<br>prisoner; that the young man David is 16 years of<br>age ;-Cross examined, swore he asked David whether<br>he was guilty with respect to the 30l. he confessed he<br>was; he endeavoured to question him at other time<br>but he broke out into a flood of tears.<p>The evidence for the Crown was summed up, in a<br>speech near two hours, by the LORD ADVOCATE,<br>with his usual ability and candour ; and for the pannel,<br>Thomas Urquhart,  by the Hon. HENRY ERSKINE,<br>who, as on all occasions, exerted his eminent talents in<br>support of his unfortunate client. He spoke above two<br>hours.-Lord Swinton, as presiding Judge, recapitu-<br>lated the evidence to the Jury, who were inclosed about<br>one o'clock on Tuesday morning; and at one afternoon<br>returned a verdict, all in one voice finding the abstrac-<br>tion of the money contanid in the letters addressed to<br>James Fey proven against the pannel Thoms Ur-<br>quhart; all in one voice finding the abstraction of the<br>five guineas sent by May Griffin to Stephen Muir, pro-<br>ven against the pannel, Thomas Urquhart; and, by a<br>pluarity of voices, finding the abstraction of the guinea<br>note contained in the letter sent by David Rutherford<br>to Alexander Walter, proven against the pannel Tho-<br>mas Urquhart-And, all in one voice, finding David<br>Urquhart guilty, in consequence of his judicial confes-<br>sion; but earnestly recommended him to his Majesty's <br>mercy.<p>The Court sentenced both prisoners to be executed<br>at the common place of execution in this city on Wed-<br>nesday the 18th of October next.</p>
