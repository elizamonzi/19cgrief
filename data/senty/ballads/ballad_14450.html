	<p> Christs Kirk on the Green<p>Composed  (as was supposed) by King James the fifth,newely corrected according to the original copy.<p>Was never in Scotland heard or seen,<br>Such  dancing and deray;<br>Neither at Faukland on the green,<br>nor Peebles at the play,<br>As was of Woers as I ween;<br>at Christs Kirk on a day:<br>For there came Kittle washen clean,<br>with her new Gown of Gray,<p>Full gay that day<p>To dance these damsels them dight,<br>these lassies light of laits <br>these  Gloves  were of the raffal right,<br>their shoes were of straits<br>Their kirtles were o' linco'u light<br>well prest with many plaits<br>They were so nice when men them neigh'd<br>they squell'd like any gaits,<p>Full Loud that day.<p>Of all these Maidens,wild as weed,<br>was none so gimp as Gillie :<br>As any rose her rude was red,<br>her lire was like the Lillie,<br>But yellow, yellow was her head,<br>and she of love so silly ;<br>Though all her kin had sworn her dead<br>the would have none bart Willie.<p>Alone that day,<p>She scorned Jack and scripp'd at him,<br>and murgeond him with mocks;<br>He would have loved her, she would not let him<br>for all his yellow locks.<br>He cherisht her, she bad go chat him<br>the counted him not two clocks:<br>So Shamefully his short jack set him,<br>his legs were like two rocks,<p>or rangs that day<p>Tom Lutter was their Minstrel meet,<br>good Lord how he could lance:<br>He play'd so shril, and sang so sweet<br>while Tousie took a trance.<br>Old Lightfoot there he could foreleet,<br>and counterfitted France.<br>He held him like a  man discreet,<br>and up the Morice dance,<p>He took that day,<p>Then seven came stepping in with stends,<br>no rink might him arrest;<br>Splay foot did bob with many bends,<br>for Masie he made request,<br>He lap while he lay on his lends,<br>and rising so was preast,<br>While he did hoast at both the ends,<br>for honour of the Feast,<p>And danc'd that day,<p>Then Robin Roy began to revel,<br>and Tousie to him drugged :<br>let be quo' Jack and call'd him jevel,<br>and by the till him rugged,<br>Then Keasie clicked to a kevel,<br>God wots as they two lugged :<br>They parted there upon a nevel:<br>Men say their hair was rugged<p>Between them twa<p>With that a friend of his cry'd Fy,<br>and forth an arrow drew:<br>He forged it so forcefully,<br>the bow in flenders flew,<br>Such was the Grace of God, trow I,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br> for had the tree been true,<br>Man said, who knew his Archery,<br>that he had slain anew,<p>Belyve that day<p>A yap young man that stood him neist,<br>soon bent his bow in ire,<br>And etled the bairn in at the breast<br>the bolt flew over the bire:<br>And cry'd Fy, he hath slain a Priest,<br>a mile beyond the mire :<br>Both Bow and Bag from him he keist<br>and fled as fast as fire<p>From flint that day.<p>An hasty Kins-man called Mary,<br>that was an Archer keen,<br>Tyed  up a tackle without tarry,<br>I trow the man was seen:<br>I wot not whether his hand did vary,<br>or his foe was his friend :<br>But he scape by the mights of Mary<br>as one that nothing mean'd.<p>But good  that day<p>Then Lawrie like a Lyon lap,<br>and soon a slain can sedder;<br>He height to pierce him at the pape,<br>there can to wed a wedder;<br>He hit him on the wamb a wap,<br>it bust like any bladder.<br>He scaped so such was his hap,<br>his doublet was of leather<p>Full fine that day<p>The buff so boistrously abaist him,<br>that he to the earth dusht down:<br>The other men for dead he left him,<br>and fled out of the Town,<br>The wives came forth and up they rest him<br>and found life in the lown ;<br>Then with three routs there they rais 'd him<br>and cur'd him out of sown,<p>Fra hand that day.<p>The Miller was of manly make,<br>to meet him it was no mowes: -<br>There durst not ten Some there him take<br>so cowed he their powes,<br>That bushment whole about him brake<br>and bickered him with bows,<br>Then traiterously behind his back,<br>they hoch'd him on the howes.<p>Behind that day<p>Then Hutchon with a Hazle rice,<br>to red gan through them rummil: <br>He muddl'd them down like any mice,<br>he was no  betty bummil.<br>Though be was wight  he was not wise,<br>with such jutors to jummil;<br>For from his thumb their flew a flice<br>while he cry'd barlasummal,<p>I'm slain this day;<p>When that he saw his blood so red<br>to flee might no man let him:<br>He trow'd it had been for old seeds<br>he thought and bad have at him.<br>He made his feet defend his head,<br>the far fairer it set him:<br>While he was past out of their plead <br>they must be swift that gat him.<p>Through speed that day.<p>Two that were headsmen of the herd,<br>They rusht on other like Rams: <br>The other four which were unfear'd,<br>beat on with barrow Trams.<br>And where their gobs were ungear'd,<br>they got upon the gams,<br>while that all bloody was their beards,<br>as they had worried lambs<p>Most like that day.<p>They girn'd and glowred all at anes,<br>each Gossip other grieved:<br>Some striked stings some gathered stines,<br>some sled, and some relieved.<br>The Miostres used quiet means,<br>that day he wisely prieved,<br>For he came home with unbruised banes,<br>where fighters were mischieved,<p>full ill that day ,<p>With forks and fIails then let they slips,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  <br>and flew together with frigs:<br>With hougers of barns they pierc'd blew caps<br>and of their barns made brigs:<br>The rare rose rudely with their raps,<br>then rungs were laid on rigs;<br>Their Wives came forth with crys and claps<br>see where my likeing ligs,<p>Full low that day.<p>The black Souter of Bralth was howden,<br>his Wife hang at his waist:<br>His body was in black all browden,<br>he girned like a  ghaist,<br>Her glittering hair was so bowden,<br>her love saft from him laist.<br>That for his sake the was unyawden,<br>while he a mile was chaist<p>And mair that day,<p>When they had beir'd like baited Bulls,<br>the bone-fires burnt Iike bails:<br>They grew as week as any mules<br>that  weirled are with mails,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>For  those forfoughen tyred fools,<br>fell down like slaughtered frails;<br>Fresh men came in and hall'd the doo's<br>and dang them down in dails.<p>Bedeen that day<p>The Wives then gave an hideous yeil,<br>when all these yonkiers yoked,<br>As fierce as flags of Fire flaughs fell,<br>frieks to the field they stocked,<br>Then carles with clubs did other quel<br>on breast while blood out bocked,<br>so rudely rang the common bell,<br>that all the Steeple rocked,<p>For dread that day<p>By this Tom Tailor was in his gear,<br>when he heard the common bell;<br>He said he should make all on stear<br>when he came there himsel,<br>He went to fight with such a fear,<br>while to the ground he fell,<br>A wife that bit him on the Ear<br>with a great knocking Mell<p>Feld him that day,<p>The Bridegroom brought a Pint of Alc,<br>and bad the Pyper drink it ;<br>Drink it quoth he, and it so stail,<br>a shrew me if I think it.<br>The Bride her Maidens stood near by,<br>and said it was not; blinked ;<br>And Bartagesie the Bride so gay,<br>upon him salt she winked,<p>Full soon that day<p>When all was done Dick with an Ax<br>came forth to fell a fother,<br>Quoth he, where are you whoreson snaiks<br>right now that hurt my brother;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  <br>His Wife bade him, Go hame, Gib Glaiks<br>and so did Meg his Mother ;<br>He turn'd and gave them both their paiks,<br>for he durst ding no other<p>But them that day.<br>F I N I S.</p>
