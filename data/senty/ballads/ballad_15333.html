	<p> Horrible Confession !!<p>A Full,  True, and Particular Account of the LAST<br>SPEECH, CONFESSION, and DYING DE-<br>CLARATION of JOHN MURDOCK , (one of<br>the Emigrants who lately left this country for Ameri-<br>ca)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;who&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;was  Executed  at Brockville,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;in  Upper<br>Canada, on Monday the 3d September last, for the<br>Horrible, Barbarous, and Inhuman Murder of his<br>own Brother, by knooking him on the head with a<br>large Axe, and afterwards Burying him Alive, while<br>Cutting Timber in the Woods together.<p>ON Monday the 3d September 1821, JOHN MURDOCK was<br> executed at Brockville, in Upper Canada, for the inhuman<br>murder of his brother James, to get possession of his property.<br>On the morning of his execution, he gave a circumstantial account<br>of his guilt, by the following horrible confession :?<p>" In order that the public mind may be fully at rest, that I am<br>perfectly satisfied that justice has taken place in every respect, and<br>that I am deserving of the death I am about to suffer. I am in-<br>deed an awful instance, " that verily there is a God that judgeth in<br>the earth!" I hereby declare to my friend the Rev. William Smart,<br>and in presence of Almighty God, the searcher of all hearts, and<br>before whose dread tribunal I am just about to appear, that the fol-<br>lowing are the facts and circumstances connected with the atrocious<br>deed, for which I nave forfeited my life.<p>On the morning of the 15th March, my brother James came to<br>my house, and asked me if I would go to work with him at the<br>staves, I told him I would, and accordingly set out. We had not,<br>however, been long at work before we begun to quarrel on the sub-<br>ject of our affairs, when I again thought (as I often had before)<br>that if I had an opportunity I would take his life ! We had not saw-<br>ed more than half an hour when he proposed to split and bolt. He<br>put his axe into the end of the log; it was tight in, and he asked<br>me to put in mine to ease it, which I did. When he had put in his<br>axe again, and while he was stooping, the thought struck me, now<br>is the time. I instantly struck him with the head of the axe, and<br>brought him to the ground, I repeated the blow in the same place,<br>but do ot remember how often. It was however a great many times,<br>it was sufficient to have killed an ox. I never struck him on the<br>breast or back. I now proceeded to select a place to bury him,<br>which I did in a level place, in a kind of swamp, a few roods from<br>where we had been working. I made a small path with my feet<br>close together, so that I raised the snow on both sides. Having dug<br>the hole and put allthings in readiness, I took up the body of my<br>brother, while yet alive, and squeezed him into the hole, and bu-<br>ried him. Having put back the dirt, I found so far from being a<br>knoll, that it was hollow. So I went and gathered up some chips<br>to raise it. I then carefully covered the hole with snow, and filled<br>up the narrow path with the banks of snow made by the scraping<br>of my feet. I now cosidered it necessay to do something with<br>the blood, of which there was a great quantity. I therefore dug a<br>hole, scraped it together, and put it in with my hands, put back the<br>dirt and carefully covered it with snow. I then washed my hands,<br> and shirt in the snow, they being very bloody. I hid the axe and<br>came home, much agitated ; but I went to prayer and felt better.<br>My alarms and fear soon returned ; I went to prayer again, and felt<br>better. I always felt better if I could retire and pray. When I<br>came home I said it was so bad a day it was thought best not to<br>work, and that my brother had gone to William's for whisky. <p>I told different stories of his going to Ireland, &c. I also thought<br>of various ways of escape, by going to Ireland n.yself, &c. and<br>sometimes I thought it would not be discovered, and, God forgive<br>me, I thought of making away with the woman, the wife of my<br>brother. The plan was, by previously digging a pit or grave in the<br>wilderness, and when she should go out of her own accord, to look<br>for her husband, then to dispatch her at once and bury her. But<br>God in mercy prevented this, and I hope she will forgive me, and<br>that God will bless her in time and eternity, and also forgive me.<p>I forgive all my enemies, and may God forgive them. I wish<br>forgiveness of them, and I wish forgiveness of God. I wish to<br>die in peace with all man kind, and I hope that all good people will<br>pray for me. I pray that God may keep them from evil, from bad<br>company, covetousness and evil habits ; that they may govern their<br>passions and tempers ; and keep themselves in fear of God. I am<br>resigned to die, and feel strength and composure. I do not feel the<br>least afraid, but much happier than before my trial, I commend my<br>soul to the mercy of God through Jesus Christ, and my wife and<br>child to the blessing of God.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Witness my hand."  his<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  <p>JOHN  X MURDOCK.<p>Criminal Cell; Brockville  Jail September 3, 1821."</p>
