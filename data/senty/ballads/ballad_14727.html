	<p> Execution.<p>A correct Account of the Execution of JOHN KERR, who<br>suffered at Greenock, on Wednesday the 6th of June, 1827,<br>for the cruel and barbarous murder of his own Wife, with<br>an account of his behaviour since his condemnation and on<br>the Scaffold, and his affecting and interesting Address to<br>the numerous Spectators.<p>GREENOCK, 6th June, 1827.<p>This day, the awful sentence which was past upon JOHN KERR, at the last<br>Circuit Court of Justiciary in Glasgow, was put in force, for the barbarous and<br>cruel murder of his own wife, by striking her with a barrel stave, or some other<br>weapon, and in consequence of the wounds inflicted by the same, she is a short<br>time thereafter died.<p>About two o'clock, the prisoner was removed from the jail to the Church in the<br>Square, in front of which the gallows was erected, where they joined in prayer and<br>praise, and the unfortunate man proceeded to the scaffold. He then mounted the<br>fatal drop, and after again supplicating the pardon of his manifold sins, he gave<br>the signal, and was transferred from time into eternity.  He did not appear to<br>struggle much. He was very decently dressed. The body after hanging for up-<br>wards of half an hour, was cut down, and shortly afterwards dispatched to the<br>Professor of Anatomy in Glasgow for dissection.<p>Since his condemnation, he has been quite resigned to his fate, acknowledging<br>the justice of his sentence. He sent for the two female witnesses who appeared<br>against him on his trial, and told them that the evidence they had given was quite<br>correct, and he imputed no blame to them. He was attended by Dr. Scott and<br>other Ministers of Greenock, who aided him in his devotional exercises, and whom<br>he thanked in the kindest manner, for the great attention they had paid to his re-<br>ligious improvement.<p>He arrived in Greenock from Glasgow on the Saturday immediately after his<br>trial, under a proper escort.<p>The above unfortunate man  was about 54 years of age, and followed the profes-<br>sion of sail-maker and rigger of vessels. He was married about 30 years, and lived<br>very agreeable together for a considerable time, till drink, the bane of every evil,<br>became the ruling propensity of both, and created disturbances at various times,<br>which ended in the tragical event above narrated.<p>A great concourse of spectators were assembled to witness the awful scene.?<br>The executioner from Glasgow officiated on the occasion. <p>ADDRESS TO THE SPECTATORS.<p>He warned the spectators to beware of drunkenness and a hasty temper, as these<br>were principally the causes which placed him in the awful situation in which he<br>now stands.  He warned all these who were living in a state of disagreement, oc-<br>casioned by drunkenness, rather to part than run the risk of committing an act at<br>which human nature recoils, and which not only brings shame upon the perpetrator,<br>but hurts the feelings of all with whom he is connected.  I had no intention of <br>committing murder, neither do I mind the using of the weapon which caused her<br>death, I being very intoxicated at the time.  My wife often provoked me with her<br>intemperance, which drove me to acts of the same kind, to drawn my sorrows.  It<br>would have been well for us both had we parted some years ago, as that would, in<br>all likelihood, have prevented the awful scene which you are now beholding,?<br>Farewell! a long farewell to you all.<p>Great intercession had been made by a number of Gentlemen for a mitigation of<br>punishment, on account of certain favourable circumstances in his case ; but on<br>applying at the proper quarter, an answer was returned, intimating, that nothing<br>was to be seen which could justify them in repealing the sentence which had<br>been passed upon him.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <p>W. Carse, Printer, Glasgow.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
