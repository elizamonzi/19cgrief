The indictment against the prisoner ran has-<br>'You the said Elizabeth Nicklson or Shafto or Jef-<br>frey .  lately resding  at Carluke, are charged with ad-<br>minist  ing  on the 4th of Octeber, last, to Ann Newal <br>or Carl  residing in Carluke, a quant ty. of arsenic.<br>which you mixed up with,meal and water  and whisky,<br>and which you pretended was a medicine for her be-<br>nefit and the said Ann Newalor Carl having drank<br>there of, became.violently ill, and.died next day in<br>consequence of having swallowed the said mixture.?<br>You are also charged with having on the 28th of Oc-<br>tomber last , admin stered to to Hugh Munro,then labour<br>er  or miner at Carluke,and lodging with you,a quan-<br>tity of arsenic which  you had mixed  up.,with, po -<br>ridge and the said Hugh Munro  having pa taken of<br>the porridge became ill ' and , continued so-the two<br>following  days. You are likewise accused,of having<br>on the  30th, October last,  administered to the said<br>Hugh Monro a quantity ,of  arsenic which  you had<br>mixed  up with rhubarb and the said Hugh Munro <br>died in consequence of having partaken  of the same <br>The pris ner pleaded Not Guilty, and the trial pro.<br>ceeded-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Never before was there so connected and<br>convincing a chain of circumstancial evidence deve-<br>loped in a Court of Justice.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The following is a sort<br>of summing up of the facts of the case , as they were<br>sworn to on the trial.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It appeared the no suspicion<br>had been excited against the prisoner amongst the<br>villagers of Carluke, on the death of the old woman,<br>Carl, who resided next door to the prisoner-but that<br>when her lodger Munro died in excruciating agony<br>about four weeks after, and was buried by request of<br>the prisoner, (as indeed Carl was also) in a great,<br>hurry, reports not favourable, to her began to be o-<br>penly made, and to such a, length did the matter go,<br>that both bodies were raised from their graves, and<br>certain portions of the stomachs extracted for medi-<br>cal examination.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It afterwards appeared from the<br>evidence of the  two surgeons's at Carluke&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;as well as<br>from that of  two highly experienced chemists in Ed-<br>inburgh, to whom  portions of the matter found in<br>the stomach s has been transmitted, that minute quan-<br>tities of arsenic, but quite sufficient to cause death,<br>had been discovered in each of the stomachs.  It was<br>also proven that the prisoner had purchased arsenic<br>at two  different times,by the, hands  of another per-<br>son, for the ostensible  purpose,  as  was alleged, of<br>killing rats , by which she said her house was infested,<br>although none of the witnesses on that spot  had  ever<br>seen a,rat about the premises.  These purchases, be<br>it observed, were made immediately  preceding the<p>death of Carl and  Munro  Add  to this it was pro-<br>ven that the prisoner mixed up the dose for the sick<br>woman  Carl hersel ?and also made the porridge by<br>which her  l dger Munro was poisoned . With regard <br>to this poor highlander,it  appeared  that he came <br>home on a Saturday, in as good health and  high glee<br>as ever  he was in his life, looking forward ,no doubt<br>to a happy meeting he was soon expecting to have<br>with 'his friends in Skye, and that having partaken of<br>some porridge.made by the prisoner, he was soon  <br>after seized  with dreadful  thirst and -pain,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; in this&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br> state the continued for two days  when she again ten  <br>dered  him  mixture  of rhubarb  as she alleged; soon.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>after which she expired in great agony. The priso-<br>ner owed&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  Munro five pounds, which  she could  not<br>pay, and this seemed to be the only caus- she had for&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'<br>commit ing to diabolical a crime.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;,About the-period<br>of the murder, jeffray  used  many inefectual tricks'<br>o make-the friends of the deceared believe that she<br>had  accounted on  the money to the deceased, but it&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>Came clearly out that she had not  paid a farthing of  <br>it.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard, to the murder of the old woman,<br>Carl, the Depute-Advocate's theo y was, that the<br>prisoner had tried her hand on her to discover how<br>much poison it would take to kill the young man,<br>Munro but the villagers say the houses were very<br>Scarce at Carluke, and that the prisoner wished to<br>make room for a more productive lodger.There were<br>many other facts came out in d tail, all tending to<br>criminate the prisoner, who after a trial of 18 hours,<br>was found Guilty, and sentenced to be Executed this<br>day, but recommended to mercy by the Jury?for<br>what reason, or on what grounds, was not mentioned.<br>On this  recommendation the prisoner had-great hopes<br>until Thursday, when an answer to an application to<br>Lord John Russell,from a few Quakers and other<br>eccentric individuals in this City, was refused; These -<br>characters say it was a mighty piece of unheard-of<br>cruelty to execute BURKE!&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; .<p>But we have no patience with them?their maukish<br>ravings are an outrage on nature and common sense,<br>how humane, and kind, and charitable 'they are to<br>the cold blooded murdere.?while not a sigh is given<br>tor the innocent butchered victims!<p>When the prisoner understood there was no hope,<br>(Which had been so unproperly  raised) she betook<br>herself to her devotions, and has continued  almost<br>since,engaged  in prayer.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The crowd ,this morning,<br>around  the, scaffold  was&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;large.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After some tim e<br>spent in earnest prayer with the clergymen who as-<br>sisted her; sh  gave the signal, when the drop fell,<br>and in a minote she ceased to exist. The crowd then-<br>left  the ground in good order.<p>Muir,  Pr inter, Glasgow.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
