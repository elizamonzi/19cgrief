	<p> Shameful Case of Incest.<p>A Full, True, and Particular Account of that most extraordinary<br>shameful and disgraceful case of Incest between the Minister of<br>the parish of Logie, in Ross-shire, and his own, sister, She was<br>seized with the pains of child-birth, while playing at her piano,<br>on the 5th of November last, - her brother being at the time as-<br>sisting at the dispensation of the Sacrament in a neighbouring<br>parish. Together with an account of his confession of the un-<br>natural crime, and his resignation of his holy office.<p>The parish church of Logie, in the county of Ross, has again<br>become vacant, and under circcumstances of the most painful and<br>awful description.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As the case will soon come publicly before the<br>Presbytery, and as a hundred idle reports (some of them implicat-<br>ing innocent persons in a neighbouring county) are afloat on the<br>subject, we shall briefly recapitulate the facts,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On the 5th of No-<br>vember last, Miss K., sister of the minister of the parish, who re-<br>sided in the manse and superintended the domestic establishment,-<br>was suddenly taken ill while playing on the piano-forte.  Her bro-<br>ther was absent,  assisting to dispense the Sacrament in another<br>place, but aid wss immediately procured.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The young lady's ill-<br>ness continued to increase, and at length  (to the grief and astonish-<br>ment of those present, who never once suspected her condition) she<br>was delivered of a child.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She had made no preparation for the e-<br>vent, and she refused to give any information as to the paternity<br>of the infant,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  About ten days passed over,  when the minister dis-<br>appeared, leaving his church and flock.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  No person knew whither<br>he had gone, but in a short time the  Moderator of the Presbytery<br>received a letter from him written from  Aberdeen, acknowledging<br>an incestuous connection, and resigning his living.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The effect of<br>such intelligence on the virtuous and religious inhabitants of that<br>district, we shall not attempt to describe.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The unfortunate female<br>who had participated in the unnatural guilt of her brotner, was pur-<br>sued to the west coast, whither she had fled, was apprehended, and<br>brought last week to Dingwall.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; From the latter place she was con-<br>veyed in a chaise, accompanied by an officer and a female attend-<br>ant to Tain ; but while the man left the vehicle for a few moments<br>to wait upon the sheriff with an account of her apprehension, or to<br>receive fresh instructions, the offender and her attendant alighted<br>from the chaise and escaped.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We know not whether they have<br>been closely pursued, but we sincerely trust that they will elude<br>detection, and thus prevent a trial which would be fraught with so<br>much sorrow, shame, and disgrace.-Inverness Courier, Dec. 1336.</p>
