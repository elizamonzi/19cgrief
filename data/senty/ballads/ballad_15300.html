	<p> OUTRAGE<p>BY IRISH SHEARERS<p>Copy of a letter received this morning<br>from an inhabitant of Lauder; con-<br>taining a particular account of that<br>dreadful Riot which took place there<br>on Monday morning last, between<br>a number of Irish shearers and the<br>inhabitants.<p>Lauder, Sept. 26th 1821.<p>Sir,-In answer to your enquires respecting the riot, I have<br>collected the following accounts for your satisfaction. A man<br>and his family, all Irish, of the name of Dougherty, a resident in<br>Glasgow, consisting of his wife, three sons, and two daughters,<br>a wild and unruly sett of people, and I suppose a kind of travel-<br>ling Gypsies, as they profess to be boiler-makers, or, as we call<br>them, tinklers, came here last week on purpose to be hired on<br>Monday morning for the Harvest. During the last week num-<br>bers of shearers, mostly our own town's folks were engaged by the<br>neighbouring farmers ; this enraged the Hibernian, and he was<br>heard to swear vengeance in a public house on Saturday night.<br>It is currently reported here, but I cannot vouchsafe for it being<br>truth, that his daughter would never leave Lauder until she set it<br>on fire. Early on Monday morning, this motely groupe com-<br>menced the disturbance; they had been drinking all night, and<br>were actually in a state of madness, Being hiring morning, and<br>by far the greater number of the shearers Irish, the Doughertys<br>were joined by their countrymen, and a disgraceful scene of attack<br>and plunder was made upon the town. The inhabitants was<br>forced to collect to defend their lives and property. Some of the<br>Pats, having a longing after kirn'd milk and butter' had entered<br>the house of a old woman, and laid seige to the kirn, upon which<br>she left them in quiet possession, but when she got safe into the<br>street, set up a dismal yell; this served to make the Inhabitants<br>look round them, more especially as the rioters were seen entering<br>the shops, and others making their escape with the gudewifes,<br>cheeses. A bloody battle commenced at this time, each party<br>armed with pitch-forks, hooks, &c. several severe wounds were<br>received on both sides, and one of the Dougherty's received seven<br>lead bullets in his body from a rusty old gun, which some of the<br>farm servants procured, but he was forced to desist by the constables<br>in case of killing any of them, as they only wanted to apprehend<br>the ringleaders. We succeeded in driving them from the town<br>and took 16 into custody. It was thought prudent, in case of<br>another attack, to send for a guard of military, and a small detach-<br>ment arrived next morning. The sheriff of the county arrived<br>and assisted by the magistrates, a precognition of the affair is<p>going on.</p>
