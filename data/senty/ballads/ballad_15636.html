	<p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  THE LAST SPEECH AND DYING WORDS,<p>Of John Stewart, who was executed within the Flood-<br>Mark at Leith, upon the 4th January 1711, for<br>the Crime of Piracy and Robbery.<p>UPON the 28 Day of March, one Thousand seven Hundred and<br>Ninteen Years ; I Sailed from Dartmouth in England, in the Ship,<br>called, the Mark de Campo, belonging to Ostend, Captain Mathias<br>Garribrae Commander, in Order to make a Voyage to Guinea, and<br>Mosambequie in the East-Indies ; and having in some short Time thereafter<br>arrived upon the Cost of Guinea; We hapned to our sad Misfortune upon the<br>2d Day of June next, thereafter, to be taken by a Pirate Ship, commanded<br>by Captain Davies ; after we had made what Resistance we could, they com-<br>pelled me and several others out of our Ship to go along with them; and u-<br>pon our Refusal threatned to puts us immediatly to Death, or leave us upon<br>some Desolate Island, which was nothing better than Death ; and I refer it<br>to every ode to Judge, whither or not any Man would have preferred imme-<br>diat Death to go along with them, while there remained some Hopes of<br>making ail Escape, which I and those that were taken with me still endea-<br>voured, and made several Attemps to Effectuat. And I do solemnly De-<br>clare as a dying Man, that whatever I did while I was Aboard of the Pirate<br>Ship, was by Force, and upon the Peril of my Life ; and that I and these<br>taken With me, are not only Innocent of What is laid to our Charge, but<br>during the Time We Was Aboard of them, I never seed them wrong Man,<br>Woman or  Child; and I with several others having at last made our Escape,<br>We Sailed for Britain, with no other Design but to free and clear our selves<br>from the Tyranny of those Pirates, that had detained so fair contrary to our<br>Inclinations; and having landed in the West of Scotland, every Body knew<br>how we have been treated since that Time, and I might have purchast my.<br>Life, had my Cohscience allowed me to Comply with the Sollicitation of<br>them, who would have had me appear as an Evidence against those that were<br>as Innocent as my self, but I never could think of Saving my Life at so dear<br>a Rate And for the Judge and Jury I shall not Reflect on them, but do de-<br>clare that I'am Innocently put to Death, as to the Crimes for which I am<br>condemned; And beg GOD Almighty that he may not lay this Innocent<br>Blood to their Charge, but forgive them as I do. And begs GOD may for-<br> give my other Sins, (through the Merits of JESUS CHRIST my only Re-<br>deemer ) which has been the Cause of this Dismal Death.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Into thy Hands,<br>O GOD, I recommend my Spirit.<p>EDINBURGH, Printed by Robert  Brown in Forrester's-Wynd,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1721.</p>
