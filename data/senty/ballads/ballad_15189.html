	<p> A Full, correct, and Particular Account of the Trial<br>and Sentence of MARY ELDER or SMITH, wife of<br>David Smith, Farmer at Denside, Parish, of Moni-<br>kie, and county of Forfar, who was tried at Edin-<br>burgh, an Monday the 19th February 1827, for the<br>wilful Murder of Margaret Warden, a young<br>woman, her own Servant maid, by Administering<br>Poison to her, on the 5th September last, in con-<br>sequence of which she Died the third day after;<br>but the libel was found Not Proven.<p>AT Edinburgh, on Monday the 19th February, 1827, came on,<br>before the High Court of Justiciary, (after several postpon-<br>ments, one of which was in consequence of the sudden indisposition<br>of one of the Jury, after a good deal of the evidence for the prose-<br>cution had been gone through, and out of which circumstance an-<br>other postponment was rendered necessary, in consequence of the<br>urguments of Counsel against proceeding again with the case,) the<br>Trial of MARY ELDER or SMITH, wife of David Smith, farmer<br>at Denside, parish of Monikie, and county of Forfar, accused of Mur-<br>der, by having, on the 5th September last, within the house at<br>Denside aforesaid, wilfully, maliciously, and feloniously, administer-<br>ed, or caused to be procured or administered, to Margaret Warden,<br>then servant to the said David Smith, a quantity of arsenic, ar other<br>poisonous substance, mixed up with water, or other liquid, inducing<br>her to swallow the same, by falsely representing to her that it was<br>a medicine intended for her benefit; and she having accordingly<br>swallowed the said deleterious mixture, became immediately there<br>after violently ill, and lingered in great pain until the 8th of the said<br>month of September, 1826, when she died in,consequence thereof;<br>she being thus wilfully, maliciously, and feloniously Murdered.?<br>To which the pannel pled Not Guilty.<p>A number of witnesses were then examined, from whose evidence<br>it appeared, that the deceased turned unwell on Tuesday, and that<br>the prisoner gave her something to drink of a whitish colour, in a<br>large dram glass, with a peace of sugar to take after it, about nine<br>o'clock at night, which she swallowed, and went to bed.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That she<br>turned ill before morning, complaining much of her inside, and suf-<br>fering from thirst; and, on drinking water, which she always cried<br>for, saying her inside was burning, she immediately threw it up:<br>That the prisoner, on Thursday night, a witness observed, came and<br>asked the deceased if she thought a drap whisky would  be good<br>for her, to which the witness, Jean Norrie, a fellow servant,who<br>slept with the deceased, replied, that she had got enough of that,<br>or something else, she could not tell what, for such purging and<br>vomiting she never before had seen.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That Margaret Warden's<br>mother was sent for and came to see her on Friday forenoon, the<br>day she died, and said to this witness, in presence of her mother and. I<br>Ann Gruar, another witness, ' you ken wha has been the occasion<br>of my lying here, but dinna say nathing; they will get their re-<br>wards, but I forgive them.'&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That she died that night at 9 o'clock,<br>and her body appeared of a blackish colour.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She was 25 years of<br>age, was with child at the time, and George, Smith the prisoner's<br>son, the deceased had said, was the father.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The body was buried<br>on Sunday the 10th September, and the corpse was taken up three<br>weeks after, opened in the church-yard, and some particles of poison<br>taken from the stomach, which was the cause of her death,  the<br>quantity and quality of of which being particularly decribed by the<br>medical gentlemen attending; one of whom, Dr Taylor, who .had<br>been sent for, states, that the prisoner repeatedly inquired, if he<br>thought the violent vomiting would not cause abortion, addiug  in<br>her own words, I dinna care though such a thing, (a miscarriage)<br>should happen, for the' gude man would tear down the house if he<br>ken'd it.'<p>The prisoner's declaration was then read, and several exculpatory<br>witnessess examined, when the Jury were addressed by the Lord<br>Advocate for the Crown, and Mr Jeffrey for the pannel.  The Lord<br>Justice Clerk summed up the evidence, and concluded an animated<br>address at half-past 5 on Tuesday morning, when the Jury were<br>enclosed, and directed to return their verdict in writing at 2 o'clock<br>afternoon. The Court met accordingly at 2 o'clock, when the Jury<br>returned a verdict finding the Libel Not Proven ; and, after a suit-<br>able admonition, she was dismissed from the bar. This trial excit-<br>ed a great deal of interest.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  <p>Printed for JAMES M'LEAN. <p></p>
