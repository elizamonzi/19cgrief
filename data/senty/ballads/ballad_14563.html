	<p> THE<p>Monkey Barber.<p><p>AN ACCOUNT OF THE<p>Wonderful Monkey<p>OF GLASGOW,<p>Who turned Barber, to Shave the Irish Farmers who<br>came over to reap the Harvest, with a description of<br>the Ludicrous Catastrophe attending his first experi-<br>ment in that profession.<p>THIS Monkey being alone in a barber's shop, when in came a<br>broad-shouldered, well-trimmed, lusty Hibernian, who ,sat<br>himself down in a chair, and put his oaken cudgel under his thigh,<br>and said to the Monkey, " Ould gentleman, I want to be shaved."<br>The Monkey, willing to try his skill in the art of shaving, took the<br>basin and brush, and performed  the operation of lathering with<br>great dexterity, but did not prove so skilful in using the razor : he<br>drew blood at the first stroke?the second and third took some pieces<br>out of his chin and part of his nose, to make it more level,  which<br>so roused the blood of our Hibernian hero, that he jumped on his<br>feet and cried out, " You bandy-legged, pistol-shinned shamrock !<br>long-tailed, beatle-browed, pig-faced, long-nosed rascal! da you cut<br>people's faces off here ?&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Arrah ! man, I will dash the guts out of<br>your skull in one moment!"&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The barber's  son, hearing a noise in<br>the shop, came down stairs, and asked what was the matter ?" It is<br>not matter at all, at all, it is all blood ; your ould rascal of a father is<br>not fit to scrape a dead horse, or scrape a pig ; do vou see he has cut<br>my nose and half my face off ?"&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; " Sir, you must be mistaken, my<br>father has been dead forty thousand years ? but who has bled you ?"<br>" Why, the rascal has gone up the chimney with the smoke !" " Then<br>I suppose it is the monkey that has done this bad trick."&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; " I<br>do not care whether he be a monk, priest, friar or a General Monk,<br>I swear by the oath of Moses, by the rocks of Ballyshannon, by the<br>mountains of Morne, if ever I catch him, dead or alive, I  will dash<br>the guts out of his skull, if I am hanged up for it next moment!''<br>" Sir, you seem to be a highblooded gentleman and may be descended<br>from some noble family." " And sure, and so I  am, for I am of the<br>blood  of the great O'Branaghans, and the  O'Callaghans, likewise<br>the family of the Fitzpatricks." "Then, sir, Fitzpatrick is your name."<br>" My name is Patrick Fitzpatrick, from Down Patrick, born at the<br>sign of St Patrick, in Patrick's lane, on St Patrick's Day in the morn-<br>ing, as good a shentleman as ever left the sod."<p>In the meantime, in came a recruiting serjeant, and said, " How<br>do you, countryman ? " " Indeed, and in troth, if you did but<br>know my sad condition, you would pity my case, to see the scoun-<br>drel of a barber who has cut my nose and my face off" " I see<br>you are badly treated, but come along with me, and I will give you<br>a glass of good Irish whisky, and dress your wounds." " Good luck<br>to you ! I will freely spend a five-penny bit with you, if you can<br>tell me about my brother, Dennis O'Callaghan that went to the<br>wars with our dear countryman, the Duke of Wellington, and<br>knocked the brains out of forty thousand Frenchmen, in one day !<br>The Duke, hearing of his birth and parentage, gave him a great<br>post in the army ; made him a general, or an admiral, or a corpo-<br>ral, or a scoundral, or some great post with a ral in it."<p>The barber's son got rid of his funny customer, the monkey<br>came down the chimney, stifled with smoke, and never shaved an-<br>other Irish Farmer since.<p>Edinburgh ;... Price One Penny,<p></p>
