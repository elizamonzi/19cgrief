	<p> The Recent Gilmerton<p>MURDER!<p>The Latest Account of interesting par-<br>ticulars relative to these most Iniqui-<br>tous and Horrid Transactions, which<br>lately took place near Gilmerton, in<br>the county of Edinburgh.<p>(Extracted from the North Briton Newspaper of this day, Wed-<br>nesday, 5th May 1830.)<p>" Dobbie, we hear, has offerred to peach. This we were quite<br>prepared for. In the smithy at Greenend, we stated in our last<br>he attempted, in the presence of one Paterson a labourer, and the<br>smith, whose name we have forgotten, to represent the lad Thom-<br>son as the  principal delinquent ; and there can be little doubt, we<br>should think, that the disposition to, screen himself by inculpating<br>his accomplice has not been lessened since he fell into the hands of<br>the law. But supposing Dobbie to have made a tender of his ser-<br>vices as King's evidence, which we think extremely probable, will<br>they be accepted ?<p>" On renewing our inquiries and investigations into this most<br>lamentable case, we have learned that the carters and the woman<br>did not remain above two hours in the public-house near Gray-<br>field toll : that they entered sometime after seven and departed be-<br>tween nine and ten o'clock, taking, as we formerly stated, the Craigs'<br>road. Our previous information had led as to conclude that they<br>did not take their departure till about an hour later, or between ten<br>or eleven o'clock. When they entered the public-house, which is<br>kept by one Pentland, the woman " lit her pipe at the ribs of the<br>grate" in which was a fire, and one of the men saying that they<br>were " yaup," (hungry) asked if they could get a herring. During<br>the time they remained in Pentland's, it is alleged that they had<br>only three gills of whisky, for one of which the woman paid three-<br>pence. But Margaret Paterson told her parents, while on her death-<br>bed, that they had four gills,  and that she paid in all tenpence. The<br>people in Pentland's, however, say that the seemed to have got a<br>dram before she came to their house, although she did hot appear<br>in any degree cut or intoxicated, but, on the contrary, " quite sen-<br>sible." While they remained in Pentland's the men treated her<br>well, and there was nothing particular in their conversation or con-<br>duct towards her. On leaving, they said to Pentland, that " they<br>were going to give the woman a ride in the cart."<p>" It may serve to give some idea of the total absence of any thing<br>like moral feeling among the Gilmerton carters generally, who in-<br>deed are nearly all of them of the same " mark and likelihood," if<br>we state that they continue to treat this matter lightly, thinking<br>that, because the two members of their fraternity charged with this<br>atrocious crime were " the waur o' drink," they will not be held re-<br>sponsible for what they may have done under its influence. Indeed,<br>they look upon it" altogether as a drunken frolic, which can scarcely<br>entail upon those concerned in it any heaver visitation than a short<br>durance at hard labour in Bridewell; and hence, while Dobbie and<br>Thomson were confined in the Lock-up-house, the wife of the<br>former came in front of the building, and called out to her hopeful<br>husband, who wag at one of the windows,- " Keep up your heart,<br>Robin, she was a d?d------."&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Deeper moral  depravity than<br>this it is scarcely possible even to imagine,"<p>" A sheriff 's officer was our on Monday afternoon, making inquiries<br>respecting the tobacco-box, which, as mentioned in our last, Margaret<br>Paterson stated on her death-bed to have been In her possession<br>when she went, upon the cart after leaving Pentland's, and which,<br>besides some tobacco, contained two pawnbroker's tickets ; but we<br>have not learned what success attended his inquiries. Mrs Pent-<br>land, it seems, did not observe the tobacco-box, although, as already<br>stated, she saw Margaret Paterson, lit her pipe at the fire when a he<br>first came in,"<p>Edinburgh :?Printed for John Craig.</p>
