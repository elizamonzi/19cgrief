	<h2>Transcription</h2>
	<p> A correct account of the hardened &<br>deplorable behaviour of Charles<br>M'Ewan (now under sentence of death<br>in Edinburgh,), since his condemna-<br>tion; with a sketch of his life and<p>transactions in the north, since he left&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  <br>Ireland, about ten years ago.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <p>The Unfortunate man, who is lying under in the Calton Jail,<br>attracts at present the  pity and commiseration of the well-<br>meaning and humane part of the community, in conse-<br>quence, of his hardened and careless behaviour since his con-<br>demnation, The following brief sketch of his life was given<br>us by a  near relation of his own.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  <p>The prisoner is a native of Ireland, and his real name is<br>M'Eoch,  but  he took the names of Robert M'Leod, John.<br>M'Intyre, Charles  M'Intosh,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Charles M'Kay, and Charles<br>M'Ewan  according&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;as circumstances suited, but he was best<br>known by the latter.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He and a number of his relations left<br>Ireland  about&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;10 year's back, and travelled in Scotland as<br>tinklers.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The prisoner pitched upon the north of Scotland<br>as the best country to carry on  his trade.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the shires of<br>Aberdeen, Inverness &c. he  was soon  well known, and to<br>many that lived in remote  places,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;having  heard of  daring<br>deeds committed by him,  his  appearance  in their cottage<br>would throw a dampness over them.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He was  the terror of<br>all the  vagrant travellers&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;in&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;that  quarter,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and it&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;is  said<br>he Would help help himself at pleasure to part of their goods<br>if they were at a distance from the  hands of justice.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This<br>and his readiness in giving battle to any that opposed him<br>got him the appelation of  "the&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cock of the North."&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He<br>has lived with various women as man and  wife ; the one he<br>lived longest with, has 3 children.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The unfortunate woman<br>whom he murdered had at that time been only 3 or 4 days<br>co-habiting with him at that time.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  After  committing the<br>bloody deed, he became restless, which, was observed in the<br>various houses he  sleeped  in&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;afterwards.<p>During his trial he seemed quite unaffected,and after being&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>taken to his cell, he was quite sullen.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A number of Pious<br>Gentlemen visited him,  with the humane intention of en-<br>deavouring to awaken him to a sense of his awful situation.<br>Instead of receiving them with pleasure, he treated them in<br>the coldest manner, and told them that if had done the deed<br>it was a matter of his own and none of theirs&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The unhappy<br>man continued in this state till within a Few days back, when<br>he is now beginning to entertain feelings better suited to his<br>situation.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Lately he has been daily visited by three Cathol-<br>ic Clergymen with whom much of his&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;time  is&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;consumed;<br>and to their exhortations must be ascribed the change in his<br>behaviour.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He has become more tranquil: and social; but<br>continues to discover a  lamentable insensibility to&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the fate<br>which awaits him.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When  in  a talkative mood, he speaks<br>boastingly of his athletic exploits in the&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Highlands; and is<br>femiliar with the names of all the English pugilists.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He ex-<br>presses great  anxiety concerning the fate of the impending<br>battle  betwixt&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Spring  and&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Langan ; and a few days&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ago,<br>after having been shaved, he invited the barber to spar with<br>him, which of course was declined.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Once a week he is visit-<br>ed by a near relation residing in Leith,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;who has attempted<br>in vain to engage him in some suitable conversation.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Every<br>attention has been paid to his comfort, but he seems to draw<br>his chief temporal solace from a a tobacco-pipe, which he is<br>almost continually smoking.<p>Edinburgh, Printed for the Booksellers,</p>
