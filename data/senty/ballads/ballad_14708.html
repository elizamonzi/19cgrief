	<h2>Transcription</h2>
	<p> Execution<p>Of James Anderson and David Glen, who suffered<br>at Ayr, oh Friday the 12th of December 1823<br>for the Murder of Mr John M'Clure, while re-<br>turning from Ochiltree Sacrament to Ayr, with<br>an account of their Behaviour in confinement and<br>the prayer which they put up on the Scaffold.<p>Ayr, December 12th, 1826.?This day, the men mentioned above, underwent the<br>ignominious punishment attached to the crime of murder, which they committed "on<br>the body of Mr John M'Clure, on Sunday the 6th of July last. In the course of the<br>afternoon, the prisoners entered the Holmston toll-house, without-paying for the drink,<br>and carrying away with them several articles belonging to the landlady. This led to<br>more disgraceful proceedings; some respectable men "and women they abused in the<br>most opprobrious language, but. being in a car, they increased the speed of the horse<br>and made their escape.<p>A number of witnesses proved that the prisoners met M'Clure, and struck and abus-<br>ed him in such a brutal and violent manner, that death ensued in a short time there-<br>after. The deceased was a quite inoffensive man, and an elder of the church.<p>During their confinement, which was partly in Edinburgh, arid for the last. 3 weeks<br>here, where they arrived on the 17th Nov. under a proper escort, they behaved in a<br>manner which became men on the brink of an eternal world. They were assisted in<br>their devotional exercises by several of the Ministers of Ayr, who paid every attention<br>to their spiritual welfare. They expressed deep contrition for the crime which they<br>were to suffer for, and entertained the hope that their numerous sins would be forgiven<br>through the Merits of their blessed Saviour, who died for guilty sinners, of whom they<br>were chief.<p>A little before three o'clock, the two unfortunate men appeared on the scaffold, and<br>appeared quite firm and compored ; they were decently dressed. After spending some<br>time in conversation with the Ministers and those friends who came to accompany them<br>to the last scene of suffering, they ascended the last fatal drop, and after joining in<br> the following prayer, which they had previously compoted, they were ushered into an<br>eternal world:?<p>" O thou Saviour of men, look down upon us at this awful moment with that com-<br>passionate regard which adorns thy matchless excellence. We confess our numerous<br>and aggravated sins bsfore thee, especially that crime for which we are about to suffer.<br>We deplore the rasa act ; we feel for the family of the deceased ; we feel for our own<br>friends, and the ignominy which may be attached to them on our account. Whilst we<br>acknowledge our guilt, we have only one thing to offer as an alleviation of our crime,<br>that we had no intention ; no deep-rooted hatred; no end in view in our wanton at-<br>tack ; but drink, that enemy of man, which changes the temper, and drives men to<br>the highest pitch of wickedness, was the cause of committing this horrid deed. But<br>both the sin of drinking and the horrid act itself hes open and naked before thee. O<br>God pardon us, support and strengthen us ; may the sting of death be taken away ;<br>may all our past sins be taken away. Now unto thee we commit ourselves ; O Lord<br>hear, O Lord forgive ; into thy hands we commit our spirits." Amen.?After hang-<br>ing for 30 minutes, their bodies were cut down, and sent, off to Edinburgh, under an<br>escort, for dissection.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<p>James Anderson was about 23 years of age, and by trade a collier ; Glen was about<br>25 years of age, and by trade a weaver. They both belonged to Ayr, and were for a<br>Considerable time acquainted together.?The day was very stormy, which prevented<br>the crowd from being so great as formerly.<p>Ayr, printed for the Booksellers.</p>
