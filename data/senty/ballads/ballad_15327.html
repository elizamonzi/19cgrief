	<p> Violating Sepulchres.<p>A Full and Particular Account, of the Trial and Sen-<br>tence of Thomas Stevenson, alias Hodge, who is to<br>be Banished for Seven years beyond Seas, for<br>Wickedly and feloniously Stealing Dead Bodies,<br>particularly that of Janet Moir, from the Church-<br>yard of Larbert, in Stirlingshire, in March last, and<br>for violating the Sepulchres of the dead.<p>ON Monday the 2d June, 1823, came on at Edinburgh, before<br>the High Court of Justiciary, the trial of THOMAS STE-<br>VENSON, alias THOMAS HODGE, accused of wickedly and fel-<br>oniously stealing dead bodies, and in particular the dead body of<br>Janet Moir, from the church-yard of Larbert, in Stirlingshire, on<br>the 13th or 14th of March last; and having been previously con-<br>victed under the name of Hodge, of violating the sepulchres of the<br>dead, who pled Not Guilty.<p>Several witnesses were brought forward and examined, whose e-<br>vidence clearly brought home the of once charged ; after which the<br>Solicitor General addressed the Jury for the prosecution, and Mr<br>Wilson for the prisoner. The Jury were then charged by the Lord<br>Justice-Clerk.<p>The Jury, viva voce, found the pannel Guilty art and part of the<br>crime libelled, and guilty of the aggravation.<p>Mr Wilson, in extenuation of punishment, requested the Court to<br>take into consideration the time which the prisoner had already<br>been confined, and also his ill treatment by the populace of Linlithgow.<p>Lord Pitmilly said, in awarding punishment, the Court could not<br>be influenced by the popular estimate of this offence, nor by the<br>contrary notion, of the injury which science would sustain from the<br>offence being visited with a severe punishment; but the Court<br>would only be guided by the law of the land. Taking into consi-<br>deration the previous conviction of the panel, and the ineffcacy of a<br>lenient sentence in restraining the pannel from pursuing his trade<br>of body-liftinga, he conceived it was the duty of this Court to pre-<br>vent him from practising it any longer in this country. He lamen-<br>ted from his heart the maltreatment which the pannel had received<br>from'the crowd, when he was apprehended ; but that circumstance<br>could have no effect in altering the judgment of the Court. The<br>persons who maltreated the pannel, if brought here, would have<br>their punishment measured out to them, according to their iniquity;<br>for it was not for the people of Linlithgow to take the law into their<br>own hands. At present it was only this pannel's offence which<br>they were called upon to punisn: and considering the aggravated<br>nature of the offence, as well as that it was commited by a person<br>previously convicted, he should propose that hi should be transpor-<br>ted beyond seas for seven years.<p>Lord Succoth approved of this proposal.<p>The Lord Justice-Clerk also fully concurred in it; and, in pro-<br>nouncing judgment, reminded the pannel, that when, on a former<br>occasion, he had announced to him the sentence of the Court for a<br>similar offence, he had cautioned him that if he should thereafter be<br>convicted of the same offence, he would not again escape with so<br>lenient a punishment.<p>James Alexander, previously convicted of an assault upon a fe-<br>male, was sentenced to 12 months' imprisonment; and William<br>Calderwood, previously convicted of deforcing revenue officers, was<br>sentenced to 6 months' imprisonment, and to give surety in £40<br>for his good conduct for five years.<p>Edinburgh :?Printed, For Robert Forrest, Price One Penny.</p>
