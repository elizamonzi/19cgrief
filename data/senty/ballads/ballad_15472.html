	<p> Dreadful Explosion.<p>A Full and Particular Account of that Dreadful<br>Explosion of Gunpowder, at Stobbs Mills, on<br>Thursday last the 17th February, 1825, at a few<br>minutes past Eight in the moratng, by which two<br>Men and a Horse lost their lives, and several others<br>were severely injured.<p>About ten minutes after eight yesterday morning the inhabitants<br>of the odjacent villages of Stobbs and Gore Bridge, and neighbour-<br>hood, were thrown into great alarm, in consequence of an explosi-<br>son of gunpowder, which tock place at one of the branches of the<br>extensive manufactory which Messrs. Hitchener and Hunter have<br>for many years carried on at Stabbsmills. The accident is one of<br>such a nature as precludes all possibility of ascertaining how it<br>originated, which, of course, must, must ever remain matter of con.<br>jecture ; all that is known is, that a man named Walter Thomson<br>had gone with a cart loaded with powder from one of the mills to.<br>the charge-house, a kind of temporary store house in which the<br>powder is kept, until there is room in the stove or drying house to<br>receive it, and nearly adjoins the later, and this person must have<br>been in the act of unloading the cart at the moment the explosion<br>accurred. Fortunately, however, the sufferers have been few, ts it<br>is ascertained that Thomson ( the carter ) and an old man named<br>Richard Cornwall employed at the stove, were the only individuals<br>who lost their "lives ; their bodies were blown to atoms, and but<br>small portions of them have been picked up, at great distances from<br>each other, and in such a condition as rendered it impossible to dis-<br>tinguish to which of the two they belonged ; the head and neck of<br>one was reoonised from the neckloth about it.<p>The horse was thrown a considerable distancet and some of the<br>barrels of powder which had been placed on the cart were blown in<br>the air, and exploded over the heads of the ploughmen in the fields<br>The materials of the stove house and charge house, which are both<br>raised to the foundation, are lying in directions, extending to a eir-<br>cumferance of at least half a mile, covering the fields like flocks of<br>birds. So great was the concussion that in the villages scarcely a<br>window has escaped its ravages ; that of Stobbsmills, although nea-<br>rest the scene of the explosion, has suffered least, but in Gore Bridde<br>many houses have not a whole pane left, and the roofs present a<br>most picturesque appearance ; some entirely unroofed on one side,<br>and from most of the others the tiles are moved down so as some-<br>what to resemble a sieve. The meeting-house at Gore Bridge has<br>not only suffered in glass, but the astrigals of several of the win-<br>dows have gone alone with the more fragile materials: even at the<br>farm house of Newhouses at leasl three quarters of a mile from the<br>mills, many of the panes were broken and the doors of some of the<br>houses were burst open. We haxe heard too that the glass in the<br>hot-houses at Vogrie, three miles distant were broken, and part of<br>the ceiling of the house of Fountainhall was thrown down. The<br>concussion was quite terrific in Dalkeith, four miles distant, and af-<br>fected the buildings so much as to prevent the doors from shutting<br>and in Ormiston, Tranent, and Musselburgh, it was distinctly felt.<br>Here, in Edinburgh, fully nine miles from the mills, the two explo-<br>sions were very generally heard, but supposed by many to be blasts<br>in the neighbourhing quarries, or a salut from a vessel in the Frith.<p>The quantity of powder supposed to hare exploded is calcnlated<br>at about six tons weight, forty barrels were in the store, forty or<br>fifty in the charge house, and ten on the cart. The two unfortu-<br>nate men who were killed had both families.<p>Printed for Robert M'Millan,?PRICE ONE PENNY.</p>
