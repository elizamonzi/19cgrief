	<p> THE ONLY<p>True Account.<p>Of the-Execution of Catherine Davidson, who<br>was executed at Aberdeen on Friday last, for<br>the murder of her husband, by pouring vitriol<br>down his throat; with the confession which she<br>made. With an account of a remarkable cir-<br>cumstance which happened about 40 years ago<br>at the execution of a woman in Aberdeen.<br>when the executioner threw the rope among<br>the crowd, which struck her on the breast..<p>(From the Caledonian&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mercury of Monday  Oct.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;11, 1830.)<p>On Friday, Catherine Davidson, for the mur-<br>der of her husband, Jas. Humphrey, was executed<br>at Aberdeen in pursuance of her sentence. Since<br>her condemnation her conduct has been becom-<br>ing and exemplary. On Wednesday she parted<br>With her friends, and the scene was most heart-<br>rending. On Thursday afternoon, while wash-<br>ing herself, she said, " O, it's a sair thing to wash<br>for the gibbet; but I hope I will be washed in the<br>blood of my Redeemer." She was attended by<br>several clergymen and other persons, and paid<br>great attention to their ministration.<p>When brought into the Court-house on Friday<br> she was asked by the Lord Provost  if she  had<br>been properly used  during her  confinement, to<br>which she replied in the affirmative.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  To aques,<br>tion by the Rev. Mr, Murray,  she said, " I  ac-<br>knowledge the justice of my sentence; but O,  I<br>did not buy the stuff to give him?but misfortune<br>took hold of me, and I  gave it  him? but O, I<br>did not think it would kill him?but I did it, and<br>  I suffer justly.''<p>When led out to the scaffold, she was conduct-<br>ed instantly forward to the drop, an every prepa-<br>ration being over, she addressed a few words to<br>Dr Kidd, and at five minutes before three she gave<br>the signal, and was in a few moments in another<br>world Her last words were " O, my God." A<br>great multitude,witnessed the execution.<p>It is upwards of 45 years since a female criminal<br>suffered the punishment of death in Aberdeen: The<br>last woman that was executed there was Elspet<br>Reid, from Banffshire, who was hanged on the 14th<br>Jan., 1785:<p>Jean Craig for stealing linen cloth and women's clothes, was<br>also executed on the 23d July, 1784.<p>It is a singular fact, and which Mrs. Humprey more than once<br>mentioned since her trial, that being present at Jean Craig's exe-<br>cution, on the body being cut down, the ;ope was, as was then u-<br>sual, thrown among the crowd, when the knot struck her on the<br>breast. She said that she recoiled with horror; and that the cir-<br>cumstance had borne much on her mind since she received her sen,<br>tence. <p><p><p>John Muir, Printer.</p>
