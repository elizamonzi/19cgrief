	<p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; RIOTING!!<p><p>A Full and Particular Account of these<br>Great Riots and Mobs that took place<br>at Dundee, on Tuesday, Wednesday<br>and Thursday last, the 6th, 7th and<br> 8th July, 1830, whan Three Men lost<br>  their Lives,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and about 200 severely<br>wounded! By an Eye-witness.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  <p>ON Monday evening last, the 5th July instant,<br> a man of the name of Heron, belonging to<br>Dundee, happened to be in a public-house there<br>drinking along with some others. In the company<br>there chanced to be an Irishman of the name of<br>Thurrel, and the conversation turning upon the&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>late fatal battle between Sandy M'Kay and Symon&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>Byrne, they cast out about it, and from words were&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>proceeding to blows, when it was  suggested  by&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ;<br>some one, that they should rather retire to the Law,<br>a quiet spot in the vicinity, and there figh out<br>their quarrel in a fair and regular stile, They ac-<br>cordingly proceeded instantly to the Law, each at-<br>tended by several friends, where the battle com-<br>menced in proper form. By this time a great<br>crowd had collected, and Heron happened to be<br>knocked down at the very first outset, Thurrel con-<br>tinued to strike and kick him while down, when&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>several of the spectators cried out foul play. Some&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; |<br>of Thurrel's friends, however, vociferated it was<br>all quite fair, to lay on the b------, which so enrag-<br>ed the Scots party, that they made a rush at Thur-<br>rel and his countrymen, who were pretty numerous,<br>and forced them off the field in all directions,<br>beating them most unmercifully with sticks, stones,<br>and every missile they could find. The scene at<br>this time was truly alarming, many men, women<br>and children being lying, trampled under foot,<br>much cue and bruised, and unable to make their<br>escape.<p>After putting all the Irishmen they could find to<br>the route, the mob then proceeded into the town,<br>and began searching out the houses of all those<br>whom they knew to be natives of the sister king-<br>dom, dragging them out of their beds, and beating<br>them most unmercifully,breaking all their windows,<br>and even tearing away and burning the very wood-<br>en stairs that led to their habitations. Tuesday<br>night was most alarming, the mob parading the<br>streets, and no Irishmen durst be seen, if recognised,<br>they were instantly knocked down and maltreated,<br>the police not daring to interfere with so numerous<br>a mob.<p>On Wednesday more than eighteen thousand<br>people assembled at the Cross, when the rioters<br>proceeded to the Roman Catholic Chapel, which<br>they partially destroyed, breaking all the windows,<br>and other articles in the interior. The Magistrates<br>had sent for some military, and sworn in about 300<br>extra constables, to endeavour to preserve the peace<br>of the town. The people assembled again on Thurs-<br>day, and were searching out the poor Irish, and<br>chasing them out of the town, which they were<br>glad to leave with their lives Our informant, who<br>happens to be an Irishman, narrowly escaped with<br>his life, having been chased for above a mile out<br>of town, along with three others. He says there<br>were three poor fellows killed, besides upwards of<br>200 wounded, some desperately, with broken legs<br>and arms ; and, that they were by no means quel-<br>led when he was forced to fly for his life, as they<br>were parading the streets in every direction, in a<br>riotous unruly manner, and swearing aloud they<br>would not leave a single Irishman in Dundee. He<br>left there on Thursday evening, and met with a<br>great many of his country between and there, fly-<br>ing from their enemies.<p>Edinburgh: Printed for William Robertson. <br></p>
