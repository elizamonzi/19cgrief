	<p> Trial and Sentence.<p>A Full and Particular Acconnt of the Trial and Sen-<p><p>tence of DONALD ELPHINSTONE, who is to be Execut-<br>ed at Edinburgh, on Wednesday morning, the 28th<br>of July, 1824, for the Murder of Mary Stark; or<br>Croket, his mother-in-law, on the 20th of Februrry<br>last, in Libberton's Wynd, and whose body is to be<br>given to Dr. A. Munro for Dissection.<p>Edinburgh,  2lst June, 1824.<p>THIS day came on, before the High Court of Justiciary, the<br> Trial of DANIEL, alias DONALD ELPHINSTONE, Paint-<br>er and Glazier, for the Murder of Mary Stark, or Croket, his mo-<br>ther-in-law, in Libberton's Wynd, on the 20th of February  last.  <p>On the indictment being road, and the Jury chosen, the pannel<br>plcaded Not Guilty. A considerable number of witnesses were<br>called, whose testimony were very similar as to the main facts of<br>the cause. It appeared, that Elphinstone and his wife, (who had<br>been cohabiting with a person of the name of M'Intosh,) accident-<br>ally met on the 20th of February last, in Libberton's Wynd, at<br>the door of the deceased ; that some ill language had passed be-<br>tween the prisoner and his wife, and that he threw a fourteen pound<br>weight at her. She then came to the door, crying out murder!<br>The deceased was coming up the wynd at the time, not quite sober,<br>as alleged and she lifted up an empty water stoup, which she threw<br>at the pannel, this he threw back, and afterwards drew a knife, from<br>his pocket, and thrust Mrs Croket below the 10th rib.  The de-<br>ceased was then carried to a surgeon, and afterwards to the Royal<br>Infirmary when she died, on the 9th of March. A number of per-<br>sons with whom the pannel had been employed as a Painter and<br>Glazier gave him an excellent character. The Jury were addressed<br>by Mr Alison, for the prosecution, and by Mr Maitland, for the<br>prisoner. The Lord Justice Clerk summed up the evidence, at<br>great length.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<p>The Jury then retired, and, after an hours consultation, returned<br>with a verdict, finding by a plurality of voices, the pannel guilty,<br>but unanimously recommended him to mercy, on account of his<br>previous good character. In the course of a solemn and impressive<br>address, the Lord Justice Clerk recommended to the pannel to em-<br>ploy the few remaining days allowed him on earth in the important<br>work of repentance, which was the duty, of every man, but more<br>especially his, whose days were numbered. He said, the Court<br>had no alternative, but to pronounce the awful sentence. Murder<br>had ever been considered, and ever would be considered, a capital<br>offence. He implored the prisoner, though he had been recommend-<br>ed to mercy, not to lay the flattering unction to his soul, but pre-<br>pare for the great change, and seek his peace in Heaven, through<br>the merits of his blessed Redeemer.<p>The sentence of the Court was then read, ordaining the prisoner<br>to be executed at Edinburgh, on Wednesday, the 28th July next,<br>and  his body to be given to Dr Alexander Monro for dissection.<p><p>After sentence was pronounced, the prisoner burst into tears,<br>while his brother, who was sitting immediately behind him, shook<br>him cordially by the hand, as did several other friends and ac-<br>quaintances. He was then removed from the bar.<p>PRICE  ONE PENNY.</p>
