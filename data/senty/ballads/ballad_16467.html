	<h2>Transcription</h2>
	<p> <br>The last Speech, Confession, and crying Supplication of Sir<br>TURNABOUT TOPBOOTS, and the rest of that Whig Gang<br>who were exhibited this day, on a Scaffold which had<br>been erected for them in the Grassmarket of Edinburgh.<p>PRECISELY at 2 o'clock they ascended the Scaffold, attended by the Magistrates, and a motely group of friends, curious to witness the<br>figure they would make at this ancient place of execution. The crowd was far from being so great as might have been expected, con-<br>sidering the pains which had been taken to collect them, and the hour of dinner, and consequently of leisure to the working classes which<br>had been selected. After all the preliminaries had been adjusted, Sir Turnabout spoke, as nearly as we could gather, to the following<br>effect.<p>Good people ! I appear in this miserable place, where so many before me have confessed their guilt, and suffered for their crimes,<br>to implore your compassion and intercession with his Majesty the King in behalf of those whom I and others of the same way of think-<br>ing contrived to place about his royal person, but whom he in his wrath hath dismissed from his service. It is true, and with grief I ac-<br>knowledge, that they have not in all things conducted themselves as they ought, or given satisfaction either to their royal master or those<br>who recommended them to his notice. They have quarrelled with one another, and driven from among them, I must admit, the very<br>best of their number?yea, with shame and sorrow I confess it, they have even expelled the man who was set over them to keep them<br>in order. The good King they have plagued with their bickerings, and tormented with their ostentatious preparations and boasting<br>professions, which have ended in nothing. His subjects they have not relieved as they promised ; neither have they rendered them<br>prosperous, contented, and happy, as he so anxiously desired. The ignoble and the ignorant they have dragged from obscurity, and<br>placed in stations for which they were by no means qualified, while the noble, the virtuous, and the wise, they have laboured to depress<br>and overawe by their vulgar abuse, and threats of popular vengeance. They have magnified their own wisdom, and sought to govern<br>the country without the fear of God. His church they have threatened to destroy, and declared that all religions are alike acceptable<br>to him, and that, therefore, it is no matter what religion we have in these lands, or whether we have any at all. But for all this they<br>have been useful servants, if not to the king and country, at least to some of those who helped to bawl them into office. Some they<br>have made Judges?others they have made Sheriffs?and many they have made Commissioners of humbug, with nice and comfortable<br>salaries ; but far the greater number of their expectants they have still left unprovided for. I myself have as yet got nothing but an<br> empty title, whereas I expected, long before this, to have laid my hands upon something substantial. My friend Sir Cripple Dick,<br>here, is in the same situation ; he has received nothing at all, whereas he should have been by this time chief of that Commission of<br>Inquiry which was to have been appointed to superintend the suds of the washerwomen of Edinburgh, with a salary of L.500 a-year.<br>Nor has my friend Bailie Bullhead been more fortunato ; he expected, ere this time, to have been at the head of that great piece of<br>Reform, and most necessary Commission which was to have been appointed to regulate the brawling of our Fishwives, with a salary of<br>nearly a thousand. And my worthy coadjutor, Councillor Jacobson has been equally disappointed?he was to have been chief of a<br>Commission to enquire into the capabilities of Chimney Sweeps, and bring them forward to that place in the Legislature of the country<br>to which they are so eminently entitled, with a salary, at least equal to the Bailies. In short, most of us are yet in the same destitute<br>and disappointed situation.<p>We are, therefore, truly, in a most pitiable case, and have no hopes of succeeding in our modest expectations, but by the help of your<br>stentorian lungs. His Majesty has called to his counsels the Duke of Wellington, and from direful experience, we know that he will<br>have no sympathy with our selfishness, and lend no ear to our most greedy requests?he will force every man to do his duty and be con-<br>tent with such salaries as can be afforded?neither will he give salaries to those who do nothing at all?he will not plunder the church<br>and divide the spoil with his supporters?neither will he create new Offices for our behoof, nor appoint Commissioners with large salaries<br>to enquire into matters which he never meant to redress. In short, he will force every one of us to respect the law, and make no provi-<br>sion for that Patriot band of needy Whigs, who have so long and so loudly tried, by your help, to force themselves into places of power<br>and profit.<p>I implore you, therefore, to have pity upon us, and raise your voice yet this once, till we try if we can get the old servants sent back<br>again to his Majesty, and kept in office till such time as they have satisfied our longing desires, and provided for us handsomely ; and<br>then you shall have my permission to hiss and blow them to the four winds of heaven if yon please.<p>Many other supplications were addressed to the assembled multitude ; but the burthen of all was the same. <br>Edinburgh, 21st Nov. 1834.</p>
