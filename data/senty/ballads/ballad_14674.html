	<h2>Transcription</h2>
	<p> Account of one of the most horrid murders committed by a beg-<br>gar man ever recorded; the father of the family was out shoot-<br>ing, and while absent, the beggar demanded of the woman the<br>money he knew, was in the house; the woman went up a ladder<br>to where it was lying, and pulled it after her, by which she<br>escaped from his bloody hands; he then took the two children,<br>cut off their noses and ears, and then murdered them; the cries<br>of the woman drew the attention of an officer who was passing<br>in a carriage, who sent his servant to know the cause of the<br>cries; the beggar plunged a knife in his body, and he fell; the<br>officer then advanced, and met the beggar, who cscaped from<br>him, after losing the fingers of his right hand with a sabre, and<br>meeting with the father of the children, said an officer had mur-<br>dered his family, and he had just escaped; the man flew home<br>in distraction, believing the beggar's story, shot the captain, and<br>on hearing the true account, fell down and died.<p>The following dreadful event  lately occurred in the neighbourhood of Smolensko.<br>The owner of a lonely cottage being out on the chace, a beggar, to all appearance,<br>old and weak, entered it at noon-day, and asked alms of the woman who was at home .<br> with only her two young children. The kind hearted woman invites him to rest him-<br>self, while she goes out to get something for him to eat and drink. After the beggar<br>had Satisfied his hunger, he, to the no small astonishment of the woman, assumed a<br>different language, and with a threatening voice, demanded the money, which he<br> knew, he said, her husband had in the house. The wretch rushing on her with a<br>large bread-knife, to force her to acknowledge where it was deposited, she declared<br>herself ready to give him what money she had, and for this purpose mounted a ladder<br>to a trap door leading to the loft above. As soon as she had mounted she drew up<br>the ladder after her, so that it was impossible for him to get at her. Finding that she<br>disregarded his menaces, he seized the two children, and swore he would either kill<br>or maim them, if she did not immediately come down and deliver him the money as<br>she had promised. The woman, however, remained in the loft, and endeavoured to<br>force a hole through the thatch and call for help. While she was thus employed, the<br>monster cut off the children's ears and noses ; and at last killed the poor maimed in-<br>nocents, scornfully proclaining to the mother, the murder he had committed. The<br>latter having, with great exertions, made a hole in the roof, called for help. Her<br>cries were heard by an officer who was passing by in an open carriage, who sent his<br>servant, while he remaine sitting in the carriage, to inquire what was the matter.?<br>The servant hastened.to the.spot, but on entering the cottage, was met by the mur-<br>derer, who phinged the knife into his heart, so that he fell and expired without a<br>groan. The officer, surprised at his delay, went himself to the cottage, where, per-<br>ceiving the horrid scene, he attempted to stop the flight of the murderer, and with<br>his sabre cat off all the lingers of his right hand, but was not able to hinder him from<br>embracing the opportunity to escape by the door as is stood open. The woman had,<br>while all this was passing, made her way through the roof, and run to the village,<br>which was at a considerable distance, to fetch assistance. Meantime the husband on<br>his way home meets the blood-stained murderer, whom he recognises as the beggar<br>who frequents that part of the country. The hypocrite, concealing his fears under<br>aflected lamentation, held up his mutilated hand, saying: ' Make haste ! there is in<br>your house a murderer, an officer, who has killed your children, and likewise a man<br>who attempted to defend them, and from whom I have narrowly escaped in the con-<br>dition you see.' The terrified countryman, while the atrocious villain hastens to es-<br>cape, flies, with his loaded gun in his hand, to his cottage; perceives thro' the open<br>door the officer, and the bloody corpses of his children, takes him, of course, for the<br>murderer, levels his piece, and shoots him-dead on the, spot!?The wife coming up<br>with the villagers, hears the shot, sees the officer fall, uttered a piercing cry, and ex-<br>claims : ' What have you done.-' You have killed our deliverer?not he, but the beg-.<br>gar is the murderer of our children !' The husband, whose whole frame was shaken<br>by the horror of the scene, and still more by his own rash deed, stands a few mo-<br>ments petrified and motionless  falls back in a fit, and expires !------Taken from the<p>Literary Melange.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  Printed,by W.
