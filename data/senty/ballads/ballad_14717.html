	<p> Execution.<p>Account of the Execution and Behaviour on the Scaffold, of<br>JAMES STEVENSON, for highway robbery, who suffer-<br>ed at Glasgow, on Wednesday morning, the 1st of June,<br>1825; to which is added, his confession and last dying words,<br>which he left with a friend who visited him in the jail.<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  GLASGOW, 1st June, 1825.<p>This morning, the above unfortunate young man underwent the awful sentence<br>pronounced against him at the last Circuit Court, for knocking down and robbing<br>John Brown of  £25, two watches, and a variety of other articles, on the Cathcart<br>Road, last winter, aggravated by feloniously and violently assaulting him to the<br>confusion  of his blood. Since his condemnation he has been attended by the Rev.<br>Mr. Muir, and Mr. Morrison, Chaplain to the jail, and several other Ministers.?<br>He has all along behaved in a very decent and becoming manner, paying every<br>mention to the admonitions of his instructors,  who were most  diligent in turning<br>his views from this world of sin and trial, to that  brighter and  happier state, which<br>a prepared  for all those, who, by sincere repentance  are, seek for'glory, honour and<br>immortality. After the usual preparatory services in  the Hall, the prisoner pro-<br>eveded to the scaffold, decently dressed in black, where, after spending a few mi-<br>nutes in prayer, he gave the signal, and was launched into an invisible state. The<br>whole solemn caremony occupied about an hour and a half, from a little after 8 to<br>hearly 10, which prevented the usual bustle in the streats in the middle of the day.<br>Annexed  is the confession he made to a friend who attended him in jail, and who<br>desired  it to be published for a warning and advice to all.<p>I, JAMES  STEVENSON, aged 21, was  born in Glasgow, of decent honeat<br>parents, who instilled me in the paths of virtue and honesty, and in which I<br>continued to  walk for  some time, till  seduced by evil company, I went on from<br>one  degree of vice to another, when I was at last overtaken by  the hand  of jus-tice<br>, and this day suffered for the crime of  which I  was found Guilty by a jury of<br>my country, and  the justice of which I  acknowledge ; as a warning to others  to<br>keep from bad company and crime, the following  stanzas' are addresssed, in the<br>hope  that they  will afford a seasonable and  wholesome lesson.<p>O let all men'a warning take<br>At my unhappy  fate,<br>And from then folly to awake,<br>Before it is too late.<p>Let not the thirst of wealth you lead,<br>To acts of cruelty,<br>But  in  the paths of virtue tread,<br>And  shun the fatal tree,<p>shame and disgrace attend me now,<br>I  guilty plead  to all ;<br>Submissive to my fate I bow,<br>And wait death's dreadful call.<p>But oh! the  pangs of dire remorse,'<br>BY which my bosom's rent,<br>More  painful  far than death to bear;<br>Oh ! how my heart relents.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  <p>To what distress then have I brought,<br>My friends and parents dear,<br>Yes,  their  disgrace I sure have wrought,<br>Which full soon will appear.<p>If penitence and inward grief;<br>Will  for my crime atone,<br>I surely will find  some relief,<br>For acts that I have done.<p>But should my Saviour me receive,<br>And mercy on me  have,<br>I then should die in peace, nor grieve<br>To court the Silent grave.<p>Then let my fate  a warning be,<br>To all mankind  made known,<br>And from it shun the fatal tree,<br>That I did suffer on.<p>The above young man had no regular employment; he worked  in one of the<br>sand boats in taking sand out of Clyde when apprehended  he has left some rela-<br>tions both here and in Kilmarnock, among whom is his mother; his father is dead.<br>He resided  latterly in the Calton.<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;W.
