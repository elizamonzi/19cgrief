	<p> THE<p>STRIFELING CAVALRY.<p>A NEW SONG:<p>Our Yeomen are on an' awa, brave boys,<br>Our, Yeomen are on an' awa,<br>Our Yeomen lads are the bravest lads,<br>That e'er old Scotia sa'.<p>Success to Murray's band, brave boys,<br>Success to Murray's band,<br>There's ne'er a lad that fears a Rad.<br>That rides by Murray's hand.<p>Here's to our braw lads in wine, brave boys,<br>We'll drink their health in wine,<br>And here's to their wives an' sweethearts true,<br>That's to recruit our line.<p>Our Strifeling lads are men, brave boys,<br>Our Strifeling lads are men,<br>Their hearts and swords are metal true,<br>And that their faes shall ken.<p>They'll live or die with fame, brave boys,<br>They'll live or die with fame,<br>Until with the olive branch in hand,<br>Our Strifeling lads come hame.<p>They late were wast awa, brave boys,<br>Among the frost and sna',<br>But now they're come hame, here's to the<br>brave men,<br>The Colonel an' Officers a'.<p>* The above Song, which appeared in the Strifeling<br>paper of the 15th August 1820, is there said to be the pro-<br>duction of a private soldier, who captured, " O Kenmure is<br>on an' arva', Willie'." from Jacobite Relics, and by pulling<br>out a few names, and dibbling in others in their place, has<br>converted it into a Loyal Song. An exploit truly worthy of<br>a gallant Graham, and descendant of Wallace, " True<br>Achates."!!!<p>Our Yeomen are on an' awa.] They were not so fou that<br>they could not sit on a horse, some had even the magnani-<br>mity to mount with their brown coats on.<p>Out Yeomen lads are the bravest lads.] The Poet's mo-<br>desty prevents him from mentioning any of those heroic<br> deeds which constitute bravery,?we are not so bashful.<br>The morning on which they were " on an' awa," a whole host<br>of crows appeared on the road, seemingly with an intent to<br>obstruct their passage,?the whole were put to flight, with<br>no other loss than one of the cavalry being dismounted,?no<br>prisoners were taken. Several hens, with broods of chickens,<br>were dispersed, and obliged to take shelter in barns and<br>byres. No less than a dozen of ducks were forced to betake<br>themselves to a neighbouring puddle, where the cavalry<br>thought it unnecessary to follow them.<p>Our Yeomen lads are the bravest lads,<br>That e'er old Scotia so'.<p>' There's ne'er a lad that fears a Rad.] After about a<br>score of madmen were taken prisoners by the Hussars, and<br>lodged in Strifeling Castle, our brave boys despised them,<br>and fear was banished from their breasts.<p>That's to recruit our line.] The wives and sweethearts,<br>equally brave as the husbands and lovers, have engaged,<br>should any of them skulk out of the way, to be " on an'<br>awa" in their place.<p>Our Strifeling lads are men brave boys.] Not old wives as<br>many people gave out, but really of the masculine gender !!!<p>Their hearts and swords are metal true.]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Not kail cas-<br>locks, as was most maliciously whispered.<p>They'll live or die with fame, brave boys.] The whole of<br>this stanza is happily incomprehensible.<p>They late were wast awa, brave boys.] And came back-<br>again, which is the sum and substance of the whole. Ex-<br>ploitf such as these are worthy of eternal remembrance.<p>Webster, Printer, Horse Wynd, Edinburgh.</p>
