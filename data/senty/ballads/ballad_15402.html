	<p> EXECUTION.<p> A Full and Particular Account of the Execution of JAMES<br>WEMYSS, Umbrella Manufacturer, Grassmarket, Edin-<br>burgh, who was Hanged here on Thursday the 16th day of<br>April, 1840, for the Cruel and Barbarous Murder of his own<br>Wife, or reputed Wife, on the 27th of January last.<p>This unfortunate man was tried on the 16th of March last, and<br>was unanimously found guilty of the Murder of his wife, as libel-<br>led, by a respectable jury ; both his victim and himself being in a<br>state of beastly intoxication at the time, and was sentenced to be<br>fed upon bread and water only, till the 6th day of April; on which<br>day he was to be taken from the jail to such place as the Lord<br>Provost and Magistrates of Edinburgh should appoint, and there to<br>be hanged by the neck, by the hands of the common Hangman,<br>till he was dead, and his body to be afterwards buried within the<br>precincts of the jail. Though Wemyss appeared quite careless and<br>unconcerned during the whole proceedings of the trial, and even<br>while the awful sentence of the law was pronouncing, he was<br>no sooner removed from the bar, than he became fully aware<br>of his dreadful situation, and his assumed hardihood forsook<br>him; indeed he appeared quite overcome while he was con-<br>veyed to jail. He was brought up in great ignorance, and<br>could neither read nor write, nor was of any religious persuasion<br>whatever. He was regularly visited by Mr Hyslop, the Chap-<br>lain of the jail, and by the Rev. Mr Sym of Greyfriars Church,<br>to whose pious discourses and exhortations he seemed to give due<br>and apparent thankful attention.<p>April 16, 1840.?The ill-fated James Wemyss suffered the last<br>penalty of the law this morning on the scaffold, which was erected<br>at the  usual place in the&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lawnmarket, he  having&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;been respited<br>for&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ten&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;days&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; after&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;6th of&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;April.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He was previously re-<br>moved from the Calton Jail to the Lock-up-House, where he was&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>soon waited on  by the officiating Clergymen, who continued  in<br>conversation and religious exercises with him till a late hour, and<br>to whose earnest prayers and pious discourses he paid the greatest<br>attention.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  He confessed and acknowledged the justice of his sen-<br>tence, and sadly lamented the awful crime he had committed, and<br>the unlawful and sinful life he had latterly led, for which he was<br>now about to suffer ignominiously ; and most earnestly beseeching<br>all those who saw or heard of his sad fate, to avoid drinking ardent<br>and intoxicating liquors, and the company of loose, disorderly and<br>debauched people, which was the ruin of millions, as well as him.<br>After praying privately very eanestly, he was advised to lie down,<br>which he did, and slept for a short while, occasionally sighing and<br>groaning very bitterly.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  He then&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;rose, and,  after  praying  again<br>privately, partook of a very little refreshment.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Soon after the Rev.<br>Clergymen arrived, Dr Hunter, Mr Sym and Mr Hyslop, the Chap-<br>lain of the Jail, and  Wemyss was brought to the Hall, where his<br>arms were pinioned, and where after the arrival of the officiating<br>Magistrates and their officers, a psalm was sung and earnest prayers<br>offered up to the throne of Grace on his behalf; and where also he<br>most thankfully acknowledged the great kindness and attention he<br>had received, not only from the Rev. Clergymen, who he said, were<br>most assiduous in their endeavours to enlighten his dark and dis-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>mal mind, and to bring it to a proper sense of his awful situation,<br>but likewise from the Governor of the Jail, and all under him.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The<br>melancholy procession then formed, and moved slowly up to the<br>scaffold, whereon he appeared a few minutes after eight o'clock, de-<br>cently dressed.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; His appearance indeed indicated that he had un-<br>dergone much mental suffering, and when we saw him on the scaf-<br>fold, we could not actually recognize the firm and cool character<br>which we witnessed at his trial.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To the astonishment of the spec-<br>tators, he seemed ro be quite dead when he received the first fall,<br>but in a few seconds the convulsions of departing life revived, and<br>he suffered most awfully before  life became extinct,  which took<br>place in a few minutes.<p>Menzies, Printer, Edinbur</p>
