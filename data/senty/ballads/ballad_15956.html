	<p> DUEL Extraordinary !<p>Account of another DUEL, that took<br>place on Wednesday last, l8th April,<br>in the neighbourhood of Pennycuick,<br>county of Edinburgh; when one of<br>the Parties was montally wounded.<p>The reason fur this extraordinary<br>Recontre was as follows, being handed<br>into us by one of the seconds.?At<br>the last fair, a dance in the e'ening<br>was proposed by twa three male an'<br>female farm servants, an' whether ow-<br>ing to the scarcity o' lassies amang us,<br>or the great beauty o' Peggy, she was<br>pitched upon baith be Peter Simple<br>and John Clod, but Peter being the<br>canniest like chield, she gied him the<br>preference, which so enraged Clod,<br>that he was determined to be upsides<br>wi' him; night arrived, and dancing<br>begun, every one was hearty but poor<br>Clod, and he and a neighbour stepped<br>into the kitchen to tak a dram; the<br>lads and lassies were retiring at times<br>to get refreshment, and among the<br>rest ware Peter and Peggy, when<br>Peter passed the door and seeing Clod<br>he cocked up his head quite manfully,<br>which grieved Clod very sare. Peter<br>ca'd for nae less than ha'f-a-mutchkin<br>wi' warm water and sugar, and while<br>the maid was preparing the water, the<br>loon that was drinking wi' Clod hand-<br>ed him a dose of Jailup, what he had<br>got to gie to his horse, and Clod mix-<br>ed it wi' the raw sugar, which was<br>immediately carried ben to the lovers.<br>Peter observing that the lassies liked<br>sweet toddy, plump went the whole<br>contents, they put off very little time<br>in discussing the jug, and the noise o'<br>the fiddle stimulated them to get a-<br>mang the merry group, and was just<br>in time to join a eightsome ; the room <br>was crowded and extremely warm,<br>and the fiddler played with spirit, for<br>he had just drank aff a glass or twa o'<br>Neil Gow's cordial, and, they set too<br>with vengeance; but alas, before the<br>reel was ha'f done, poor Petter was in<br>such a plight, that his white jean<br>trowsers was clapped close to his<br>thighs, this was soon noticed, for<br>Clod had looting some  o' them into<br>the secret, and they dadded Peter trae<br>the te end o' the room to the other till<br>he fairley knocked down sax fallows<br>at the door and made his escape ; in<br>fact he didna meet wi' much opposi-<br>tion by this time, for lie was a awful<br>sight Poor Peggy, poor thing, got<br>away in at the hurley-burley mair dead,<br>than alive, for she was in little better<br>order than Peter himsel'. This scene<br>created great mirth to the lads and<br>lassies, but it spoilt a' their dancing,.<br>for the room was in a terrible state,"<br>and uaebody wad tak in band to clean<br>it that night.<p>A friend told Peter next morning<p>wha was the author o' a' his misfor-<br>tunes, and he vowed to hae vengeance,<br>threatening to shoot Clod, the first<br>time opportunity offered. Poor Clod<br>hearing this, sincerely repented o'<br>what he had dune, and sent Peter a<br>letter craving his humble pardon, say-<br>ing that he w'ad ne'er hae thought out<br>himsel' if he hadna been advised; but<br>instead of Peter sending him a pardon<br>a chield advised him to send a chal-<br>lenge, to meet him on Wednesday<br>morning, with a friend and a pistol.<br>This was an unco trial for Clod, and<br>he discovered the whole o' his mind<br>to a friend, who advised him to keep<br>us his spirits, and he would be his<br>second, for love was a thing worth<br>while to be killed for, no like the<br>gomerals in the great town shooting<br>themselves for naething but nonsence.<br>The twa seconds was acquaint wi' each<br>other, and they formed a plot to get a<br>laugh at the gouks, an' it wad be a <br>means to keep down mischief, for<br>Peter was still swearing to hae re- ...<br>venge; so on Wednesday they met,<br>attended by their seconds, and twa-<br>three dozen posted themsels at the<br>back of a hedge, whare they werna<br>seen by the stout-hearted blades ; they<br>coudna muster pistols, but they got<br>twa guid auld rusty fowling-pieces,<br>an' the seconds loaded them with<br>blank shot. Like men o' honour, they<br>stood back to back, and measured aff<br>sax paces each ; but gin the had seen<br>the poor devils, as white as corpses,<br>and shaking like a leaf on a tree; <br>Clod at this time would hae fa'n on<br>his knees and asked Peter's pardon,<br>which would have been readily grant-<br>ed, but the seconds wad not allow it,<br>so being stationed, the terrible word<br>FIRE ! was given, and both pieces<br>went off; at that moment the seconds<br>loot drive a guid thumping duck's egg<br>at each of their heads, thinking they<br>were shot they both fell plump on<br>their faces; Peter put up his hand to<br>his head, and finding the egg a be-<br>spattered, bawled out most piteousely<br>" O my brains, my poor brains, get a<br>doctor and tak me hame." Clod came<br>worst aff, for a sharp stane lying be-<br>fore him he got a unco gash in the<br>forehead, and wi' fright and pain was<br>carried away in a taint. Peter tho'<br>naething ailled him could not be con-<br>vinced but that the most part of his<br>brains was lost, and he also was car-<br>ried home. Peggy is so much  af-<br>fronted that she has keeped bed ever<br>since that sorrowful night.</p>
