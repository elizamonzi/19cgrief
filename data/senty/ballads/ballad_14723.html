	<p> Execution.<p>An account of the Behaviour and Execution of ANDREW STEW-<br>ART and EDWARD KELLY, who were both Executed at<br>Glasgow, on Wednesday Morning, in the presence of an immense<br>multitude, for the daring crime of Street Robbery. Likewise, a<br>list of all the Criminals, who have been executed in Glasgow for<br>the last 60 years.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  <p>GLASGOW, NOVEMBER 1, 1826. - This day the highest punishment of the law was<br>put in force upon ANDREW STEWART, and EDWARD KELLY, convicted at our last<br>Circuit Court of Street Robbery.<p>Stewart was convicted of having, along with several others, in the beginning of August<br>last, knocked down and robbed in the Gallowgate, an Italian of the name of Filippo Testi,<br>of a gold repeater watch, with chain, seals, and key attached, two, one pound notes, and a<br>guinea one, 10 or 12 shillings in silver, a pair of black, kid gloves, same tobacco, with five<br>or six segars in a segar-holder.  It appeared that the poor foreigner had been betrayed by a<br>woman of the town, who gave information to a gang of ruffians that he had money upon<br>him. After he had been knocked down, the villains were so numerous that they firightened<br>away every person who wished to interfare, and actually kept rifling him for several mi-<br>nutes, and under the eyes of several  spectators, till the police came up, when they ran off<br>to the green, and disputed about the the division of the spoil, till a battle had nearly ensued,<br>Stewart was about 25 years of age, and was born in Belfast of Protestant parents; and was<br>by trade a weaver; he and his parents  have resided for a long time in Bridgeton; he was ne-<br>ver known to have been guilty of any violation of the laws, till the act for which he has this<br>morning atoned with his life, leaving an aged father and mother to lament the consequences<br>of his thus stepping aside from the paths of moral rectitude.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He was assisted in his de-<br>votions by the Rev. Mr. Morrison, the Chaplain of the Prison, and the Rev. Mr. Marshall;<br>to whose pious advice he paid the greatest attention.  He indulged in hopes of pardon al-<br>most, till the last day of his life; but the proper authorities considered that the crime de-<br>manded that an example, should be made, and the law was ordered to take its course.<p>Kelly was convicted along with Thomas White (but who has since been respited,) of rob-<br>bing James Fleming of upwards L.100 sterling, in the Bridgegate, on the 31st of March<br>last. The circumstances of this case are nearly similar to the last, and should be a warning<br>to people who have money on them, to beware of the company they go into, for it appears<br>that Fleming had imprudently allowed himself to be decoyed into a house with a woman<br>whom he had picked up in the street, and while in his company she had no doubt discovered<br>that he had money in his possession, and after parting, had given information to some of her<br>abandoned associates, for he, was soon after waylaid by several fellows, dragged  into a close<br>and robbed of his money, and. considerably hurt. The robbers having gone into a Mr. Mof-<br>fat's, spirit dealer, Tradeston, to divide their booty, he, by his prudent conduct had them<br>apprehended before they could get their purpose accomplished, and L. 61 of the money re-<br>covered, another of the party having made his escape with the remainder.<p>Kelly was about. 21 years of age and was also a native of the Sister island, of the Roman<br>Catholic persuasion. He had never been bred to any reguler business, and in cousequence<br>of his idle life he had more than once been the inmate of a prison. He was attended by the<br>Rev. Mr Scott and the Rev. Mr. Murdoch, to whose spiritual admonitions he paid the most<br>implicit obedience. <p>Soon after 3 o'clock the unhappy culprits ascended the fatal platform, attended by the<br>Ministers of their respective religion, and after a short lime spent in prayer, the executioner<br>proceeded to adjust the ropes, which, having been finished, the drop soon after fell, when<br>they died almost instantly.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Considering the early hour the crowd, was very considerable.<p>It appears from authentic records,  that since the  year 1765, till the preseut time, which<br>embraces a period of 61 years, there have been publicly executed in the City of Glasgow<br>82 criminals; of which number there were executed betwixt 1765 and 1781, at the Howgate-<br>head, where the Monkland Canal Basin now  is, 7; in the Castle yard, where the Infirmary<br>now stands, betwixt 1784 and 1787, 12; at the Cross, betwixt 1788 and 1813 22; and since<br>1814 till this period, there have, been executed in front of the new prison no less than 41<br>individuals !<p>In the year 1769, Andrew Marshall  for murder was hung in chains at the Howgatehead<br>as a striking mark of public infamy. <p>John Muir, printer, Glasgow.</p>
