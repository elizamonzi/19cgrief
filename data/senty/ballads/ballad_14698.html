	<h2>Transcription</h2>
	<p> A true account of the Behaviour and Execution of JOHN<br>M'CANNA and JOSEPH RICHARDSON, a farmer, who<br>were  Hanged at Dumfries on Wednesday the 14th of May,<br>1823, for uttering Forged Notes on the Ship Bank of Glas-<br>gow. Also, an affecting account of their last interview with<br>their Parents, Wives, and Children, the night before their<br>execution.<p>Dumfries May 14.?At the last Circuit Court here John M'Kenna, Joseph Richard-<br>son, and William Richardson, (brothers) were found guilty of uttering forged notes<br>on the Ship Bank of  Glasgow, and condemned to suffer death. It appeared that<br>M'Kenna and Joseph Richardson went to Dublin in August 1822, and with, the as-<br>sistance of a person from whom M'Kenna four years before, had purchased 500 notes<br>of the British Linen Company, get a plate engraved of the guinea note of Carrick,<br>Brown & Co. of Glasgow. In this business they were engaged two or three weeks,<br>and got 300 of the notes printed, which cost them for plates, engraving, signing,<br>paner, stamp. &c L26 15s. They then returned to Scotland where they were ap-<br>prehended, and 172  of the notes were found in the possession of M'Kana's wife, 163<br>in a turf dyke in joseph Richardson's yard; the remainder of the 300 forged notes<br>were uttered by the prisoners in Dumfries-shire, and the north of England.<p>A petition having been sent up to the fountain of mercy in favour of these un-<br>happy men, an answer was returned in the beginning of last week, with a respite<br>during his Majesty's pleasure for William Richardson only. A gentleman who ac-<br>companied the clergyman to the Jail, has described minutely the demeanour of all<br>the prisoners on receiving the answer to their petition. William Richardson who<br>was firm visited appeared " quite uplifted" with the communication made to him;<br>for a few seconds his colour went and came, but the first flutter of the heart being<br>soon ever, his breathing became freer, and his speech firmer; and although he ex-<br>pressed some regret at the fate of his companions, his mind was evidently Wholly<br>engrossed with the strong instinctive desire of self preservation.  On the other hand<br>M'Kana and Joseph Richardson apparently received the news of their now irrevoc-<br>able doom with every feehing becoming their situation. A note, originating in a<br>mistake, had been handed to the latter, stating that he was the respited prisoner;<br>but after the warning of his agent, he confessed that he had paid little attention to<br>it He expressed his satisfaction that his brother's life was spared, since, to use his<br>own words; "the idea of two brothers going out of life in the same awful way was<br>painful to be thought on."  As for M'Kana, he declared that he never entertained<br>any hope; but he felt quite resigned, and pointing to a book .which he held in his<br>hand, observed to the clergyman, " I find every comfort here." He was a Roman<br>Catholic, but a liberal and well informed one.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<p>On Saturday last the distracted mother of poor Joseph visited him for the last<br>time, when the unhappy woman having been so overcome by her maternal feelings,<br>as to swoon away again and again. Tuesday he bade adieu to his sister and a young-<br>er brother, and look a last leave of his wife, who was all night in the cell with him.<br>M'Canna has left a widow and seven orphans to lament his untimely end His wife<br>had with her on her last visit a little sickly infant, and it was a heart rending sight<br>to see the father, as he reclined on the iron bed to which he was chained, warming,<br>this little babe in his  bed clothes, and bending over it with the greatest tenderness<br>Their final parting was a scene truly distressing.<p>Both the unhappy men were unremitting in their preparations for death, and they<br>appeared to receive most grate fully the.attentions of the ministers Who visited them.<p>The scaffold was erected in front of the prison in Buccleugh Street. At an early<br>hour vast muititudes were pouring into the town from the surrounding country to<br>witness the awful scene, and long before the appointed hour the crowd was immense.<br>About three o'clock the prisoners ascended the scaffold, when the executioner (from<br>Glasgow) adjusted the fatal cord, and after a short time spent in praise and prayer,<br>the signal was given, and they were ushered into the world that is ' unseen & eternal,"<br>amongst a very general feeling of sympathy from the surrounding multitude.<p>Richardson was a native of Dumfries-shire, where he, along with his brother, rent-<br>ed a farm, and both bore ureproachable characters until their unfortunate connexion<br>with M'Canna, who was an Irishman.<p>John Muir, Printer, Glasgow.</p>
