	<h2>Transcription</h2>
	<p> THE&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <p>Teetotal Mill.<p>Two jolly old Topers once sat at an inn,<br>Discussing the merits of Brandy and Gin ;<br>Said one to the other. I'll tell you what Bill,<br>I've been hearing to-day, of the Teetotal Mill,<p>You must know that this comical mill has been built,<br>Of old broken casks, when the liquor's been spilt;<br>You go up some steps, and when at the door still,<br>You've a paper to sign at the Teetotal Mill,<p>You promise by signing this paper I think,<br>That ale, wine, and spirits, you never will drink ;<br>You'll give up, as they call it, such rascally swill,<br>And then you go into the Teetotal Mill.<p>There's a wheel in the mill they call self-denial,<br>They turn it a bit, just to give you a trial ;<br>Old clothes are made new ones and if you've been ill,<br>You're very soon cured in the Teetotal Mill.<p>Bill listened and wondered, at length he cried out,?<br>Why Tom, if its true what your telling about;<br>What fools we must he, to bo here sitting still,<br>Let us go and look in at the Teetotal Mill.<p>They gazed with astonishment,?there came a man,<br>With disease and excesses his visage was wan ;<br>He mounted the steps--signed the pledge with good will<br>And went for a turn on the Teetotal Mill.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<p>He quickly came out the picture of health,<br>And walked briskly on in the highway of wealth ;<br>And as onward he pressed, ho shouted out still,<br>Success to the wheel in the Teetotal Mill.<p>The next that went in Was a man and his wife,<br>For many long years they'd boon living in strife ;<br>He had beat and abused and swore he would kill,<br>But his heart took a turn in the Teetetal Mill.<p>And when he came out, oh ! how altered was ho,<br>His conduct was changed, and how happy was she !<br>They no more contended, ''no, you shan't! "yes I will I'<br>But they are blessing together the Teetotal Mill,<p>There next came a fellow as grim as a Turk,<br>To curse and swear seemed his principal work ;<br>He swore that  that morning his skin he would fill,<br>And drunk as he was, he recled into the mill,<p>And what he saw there, sure I never could tell.<br>But his conduct was changed and his language as well;<br>I saw when he turned round the brow of the hill,<br>That he knelt and thanked God for the Teetotal Mill.<p>The poor was made rich, the weak were made strong,<br>The shot was made short, and the purse was made long ;<br>These miracles puzzled both Thomas and Bill,<br>At length they went in for a turn at the mill.<p>A little time after I heard a great shout,<br>I turned round to see what the noise was about;<br>And a crowd, amongst which were both Thomas and Bill.<br>Who were shouting, "hurrah ! for the Teetotal Mill!"<p>Printed by R. M'Intosh, 96 King St. Calton.</p>
