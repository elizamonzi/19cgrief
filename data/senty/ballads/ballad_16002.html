Mr. Cranston, Advocate<br>for the pannel, stated some objections to the libel<br>as laid, They were answered by the Advocate<br>depute for the Crown, when their Lordships re-<br>pelled the objections and found the libel relevent<br>to infer the pains of law. The Court then pro-<br>ceeded to the examination of witnesses, some of<br>which being born in the highlands, could not<br>speak Englith, an interpreter who understood the<br>Galic language was sworn in, who explained the<br>evidence to the satisfaction of the Court. After<br>which tke Advocate for the pannel sumed up the<br>evidence on her part, as did the Advocate depute<br>on the part ot the Crown. Lord Swinton charged<br>the Jury and ordered them to inclose and return<br>their verdict to-morrow at nine o'clock, to which<br>time-the Court adjourned.<p>Wednesday the Court met according to ap-<br>pointment, when the Jury returned their verdict<br>all in one voice, Finding the libel proven against<br>Agnes M'Allum alias White, on which she was<br>ramitted back to prison till Thursday nine o'clock.<p>Afterwards Ann or Agnes Watt, daughter<br>of John Watt, residenter in Dundee, accused of<br>child-murder was called, but failing to appear,<br>she was outlawed.<p>Thereafter was brought to  the  bar,  James<br>M'Kinzie carter in Glasgow, accused of having<br>robbed three persons on their way to Blantyre<br>cotton miln and knocking them to the ground<br>and afterwards taking from&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;them  several half<br>crowns and shillings, two pieces of ben-leather<br>and a duffle-cloak, and again maltreating them<br>in a cruel manner, and being habit and repute a<br>common thies and robber.

After which, his bro-<br>ther, John M'Kenzie, travelling chapman, late-<br>ly residing in Rutherglen was brought to the bar,<br>and he having been last Circuit Court here accus-<br>ed of stealing a horse and killing him and after-<br>wards selling his skin; and having been then<br>indicted to stand trial was outlawed for not com-<br>pearing at that time, and this day presented a<br>petition craving that the warrant of fugitation<br>might be recalled, which was departed from,<br>upon which an indictment was exhibited against<br>him, accusing him of having in the month of<br>January last robbed John M'Kendrick, near the<br>cotton miln of Blantyer, of a silver watch and<br>one shilling and sixpence of silver, and knocking<br>him down to the ground with a large stick or<br>bludgeon, and when in that Situation, riffling<br>his pockets for money, when he only found<br>threepence, which he also carried off, and the<br>libel having been read to him, he pled guilty,<br>and subscribed his acknowledgement of the crime,<br>immediately after which the libel was found re-<br>levant in respect of his acknowledgement to infer<br>the pains of law, bw restricted to an arbitrary<br>punishment, and he remitted to the knowledge<br>of an assizer after which the Jury were ordered<br>to inclose and return their verdict to-morrow<br>morning by nine o'clock, and the court adjourn-<br>ed to that time.<p>Thursday April 11th the court met according<br>to appointment, when&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;James&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;M'Kenzie&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;was<br>brought to the bar, when he received sentence,<br>which was, To be carried back to prison until the<br>22d day of May next, and on that day, betwixt<br>the hours of two and four o'clock afternoon to<br>be carried to the usual place of execution and<br>hung by the neck until he be dead.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On which<br>he fell down on his knees and cried to the Judges<br>to spare his Iife, and fainted away,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;so that a<br>party was obliged to carry him out of the court-<br>house.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Next, his brother John was brought to<br>the bar, when the Jury returned their verdict, all<br>in one voice, finding the libel proven, on which<br>he was sentenced to be banished beyond seas for<br>all the days of his natural life, and his service ad-<br>judged&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;for seven&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;years,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;with&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;certification,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if<br>ever he was found in Great Britain after his be-<br>ing transported, he should suffer death without<br>the benefit of clergy.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Next was brought to the<br>bar, Agnes M'Allum alias White, when she re-<br>ceived sentence, which was To be carried back<br>to prison, and to be fed on bread and water only<br>until the 22d day of May next, and on that day<br>at the  usual place and  accustomed time, to be<br>hung by the neck until she be dead.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On receiv-<br>ing of which sentence she fainted and was led out<br>of the court-house.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Next&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;was brought to the<br>bar, Hannah Main,  who received  sentence of<br>banishment in terms of  her own petition.<p>Their Lordships gave the pannels suitable ex-<br>hortations, but their fainting on the occasion<br>prevented them from proceeding.</p>
