	<p> Shocking, Murder !<p><p>Account of one of the most Shocking Murders ever<br>read of, committed by JOHN M.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;WIL IAMS,<br>at Milledgeville, on the Body of his own Wife, by<br>Stabbing her in several parts of the Body, and cut-<br>ting her Throat from Ear to Ear; also an account<br>of his  Murdering his own  Infant only Fight days<br>old, by dashing it on  the ground,  and  throwing it<br>over the window, on Tuesday the 8th of January,<br>1824; likewise an account of the gailant manner in<br>which he was seized by a servant Girl.<p>Last evening, we were summoned to witness a scene, from which<br>Humanity recoils with horror and indignation ! a scene, perhaps<br>without a parallel since the first organization of civil society.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The<br>Circumstances are as follow : it appears that there had been a fish-<br>ing party during the day, composed, perhaps, of relations, and<br>friends, and accquaintance, of which party John M. Williams, the<br>person who committed the cruel, shocking and inhuman deed, was<br>one.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On their return in the evening, accompanied by his brother-<br>in-law and his wife, he appeared to be in an ill-humour with his<br>wife, and descended even to abuse ; but by the friendly interposi-<br>tion and good offices of the company there present, he desisted for<br>that time, and the storm, that appeared lowering, passed over with-<br>out leaving any vestiges idicative of its recurrence; but alas ! it<br>was a, most fatal security, into which he had lulled their suspicions !<br>When about to depart, he bade the sister of the wife, in an impres-<br>sive manner, to bid her farewell; but not suspecting the import of<br>this prophetic observation, they proceeded homewards.<p>Before they had been absent fifteen minutes, he commenced the<br>execution of his diabolical design, by upbraiding her with incon-<br>rinency, and ended his insulting ;and abusive language, by stabbing<br>her in the body with a clasp knife, which inflicted a deep wound<br>in her shoulder. She immediately fled, but in consequence of her<br>debility, occasioned by her having given birth to an innocent child,<br>then not a fortnight old, he easily overtook her, and with a tremen-<br>dous blow, brought her senseless to the ground.<p>Commanding the assistance of a servant girl, who was close at<br>hand, he conducted her to the house, and placed her on the bed,<br>when animation was soon restored ; he then with the most unex-<br>ampled ferocity, caught hold of his sleeping and in innocent infant,<br>and with savage and unrelenting fury, dashed it with violence on<br>the ground, and again taking it by the legs, threw it forcibly over<br>the window into the yard behind the house.<p>Returning to the bed side, with his knife drawn and stained with<br>blood, he recommenced his abuse of his wife, and endeavoured to<br>extort confessions, by repeatedly stabbing her, renewing his inqui-<br>ries with a hellish satisfaction at each successive stab, while the<br>miserable victim of his cruelty, protested her innocence, and implor-<br>ed his mercy with tears and intreaties, sufficient to have softened<br>the most savage breast.<p>The servant girl, overcome with sympathy, profiting by his posi-<br>tion, seized him, and pushed him out at the door, thereby giving<br>to Mrs Williams an opportunity to make her escape, which she em-<br>braced with as much alacrity as her weakened and wounded situa-<br>tion would admit of, and had fled perhaps about fifty yards, when<br>the unfeeling monster overtook her, and dragging her by the hair<br>of the head to a considerable distance, put an end to her life, by<br>cutiing her throat from ear to ear, in the most cruel and shocking<br>manner ever witnessed.<p>By this time, the alarm had reached the nearest neighbour, who<br>hastened directly to the scene of misery. The murderer, by this<br>time had exchanged tho knife for a razor, and kneeling down in she<br>attitude of prayer beside the body of his murdered wife, was en-<br>deavouring to dispatch himself ; he had completed part of his<br>design, but finding the task more difficult than that of murdering<br>his wife, he only succeeded in making a slight incision in the wind-<br>pipe, when his hand was arrested, and it is hoped will recover,<br>answer before an earthly tribunal for the perpetration of this unna-<br>tural deed Four helpless Children bewail the loss of their mother.<br>Examiner, 9th January, 1823. Edinburgh, Printed, Price One Penny.<p></p>
