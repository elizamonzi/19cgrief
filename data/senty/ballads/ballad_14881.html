	<h2>Transcription</h2>
	<p> The  Paisley Officer.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <p>In blythe and bonny Scotland, where the blue bells do grow,<br>There dwelt a pretty fair maid down in a valley low.<p>Its all the day long; she herded. sheep upon the banks of<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clyde,<br>Altho' her lot in life was low she was called the village pride.<p>An officer from Paisley town went out to fowl one day,<br>He wandered to the lovely spot where Mary's cottage lay.<p>A long and loving look he took upon her form so fair,<br>And wonder'd how so bright a flower grew and flonrish' d<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;there.<p>But many times he came again and at each visit paid,<br>His flatt'ring tongue did win the heart of this sweet village<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;maid.<p>At length he came one morning, his face was dark with woe<br>O  Mary dear," he said to her. " from you I now must go.<p>Our regiment has received the rout, and love and duty yields,<br>I  must exchange your lovely glens for India's burning fields<p>"O Henry," said the tender maid, " from you I cannot part<br>Take me as your wedded wife?you know you've won my&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;heart.<p>To go with you through flood & field is now my chief desire,<br>And as your servant I will go disguised in man's attire."<p>He took her on to Paisley town and much they wonder'd<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;there,<br>To see the new recruit that look'd so gentle, slight, and fair<p>The ladies admired her as she stood each day upon parade,<br>But no one thought the soldier's coat conceal'd a lovelymaid<p>Soon across the raging seas and marched on burning sand<br>No pen can trace what Mary bore in India's track of land.<p>But though she found her strength give way, her woe she<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;strove to hide,<br>And smiled as she look'd round and saw young Henry by<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;her side.<p>But now the hour of trial came, when on the battle field,<br>She saw the British troops give way, and to the Indians yield<p>She saw her lover too struck down a spear had pierced his<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;side<br>Yet from his post he never flinch'd, but where he stood he<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;died.<p>She raised him from the bloody ground and in her arms him<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;pressed,<br>And while she thought to staunch his wound a ball passed<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;thro' her breast.<p>So as these pair lived true in life in death they were the same<br>For when their fond hearts' blood gush'd forth it mixed in<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;one red stream.</p>
