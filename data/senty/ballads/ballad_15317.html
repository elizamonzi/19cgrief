	<p> Dreadful Fire !<p>A Full and Particular ACCOUNT of<br>a most Calamtious FIRE which hap-<br>pened in a large Tenement in the<br>Cowgate, Edinburgh., this morning,<br>Monday, 10th September,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1821,<br>about half an hour before One<br>o'Clock,  by which three Lives were<br>Lost, and several severely Wounded<br>and Bruised.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <p>A DREADFUL FIRE broke  out this morning, Monday, 10th<br>September, 1821, about half an hour before one o'clock, in,<br>a large five story house  in  the  Cowgate,  immediately opposite  to<br>the foot of the  Parliament Stairs,  which,  we are sorry to say, was<br>attended with very fatal consequences.<p>The Fire originated in an apartment on the second floor, and,<br>burning with great fierceness, soon communicated to the floors<br>above, and the one immediately below. About half an hour after,<br>the stair, a wooden one, was enveloped in flames ; but previous to<br>this, all the inhabitants, except one on the third floor, escaped to<br>the street, many of them half naked.<p><br>The family which thus unfortunately remained, consisted of a<br>man named Bannerman,  his wife, and three children. Bannerman<br>himself leapt over the window, with a child in his arms, and escap-<br>ed with some slight hurts ;?but his wife was less fortunate; after<br>dropping a child from the window, she leaped over herself with<br>another in her arms. They were all three taken up alive, and the<br>poor woman, who was also far advanced in pregnancy, was carried<br>to the Royal Infirmary with one of the children, where they soon<br>after expired. The other was taken into a neighbouring house, and<br>survived but a few minutes.<p>Bannerman was lately a Serjeant in the 71st or Glasgow Light<br>Infantry regiment, we believe, and his wife is a native of Portugal.<br>The man in whose house the fire originated also lies in the Infir-<br>mary, with his thigh severely burned. Two of the firemen were<br>also considerably hurt by the falling of the burning rafters, and a<br>man has since been dug out of the rubbish almost dead, who had<br>fallen from the top of the burnt walls, and carried to the Royal<br>Infirmary, with but little hopes of recovery.<p>The fire engines were soon brought to the spot, but we regret to<br>state that their efficiency was much impeded by the want of water.<br>Having at length got access to Mr Campbell's brewery, a plentiful<br>supply was obtained ; but the rage of the flames defied the exer-<br>tions of the firemen ; and, in a few hours, the tenement in which<br>the fire broke out, and the one immediately adjoining to the west-<br>ward, which was separated only by a thin partition, were reduced<br>to smoking walls, except the shops on the ground floor, which suf-<br>fered much from the water, and the destruction necessarily occa-<br>sioned by the confusion of removing the stock and furniture.<p>The shops and tenements, which belonged to different proprie-<br>tors, were all insured. The three upper flats were divided into<br>two apartments, and occupied by numerous poor families who<br>have lost every thing they possessed. We understand they were<br>not insured. We trust that no time will be lost in setting on foot<br>a subscription for the unhappy sufferers, who are reduced, as may<br>easily be conceived, to a state of very great distress.<p>A Picket of the Military from the Castle attended to guard the<br>little  property saved  and keep order, and the  Magistrates and a<br>Party of Constables were very active in rendering every assistance,<br>as well  as the Superintendant of Police  and a detachment of his<br>Officers.<p>Several private individuals were also observed very useful and<br>deserved great praise.<p>PRICE ONE PENNY</p>
