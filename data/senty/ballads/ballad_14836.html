	<p> THE<p>Charming Young Widow<p>I MEET IN THE TRAIN<p><br>I live in Falkirk and one morning last summer<br>A letter informed me my uncle was dead,<br>Anp also requested I'd come on to Glasgow,<br>As he left me a very large sum of money it said.<br>Of course I determined of making the journey<br>And to book myself by the First Class I was fain;<br>Tho I had gone Third I had never encountered<br>The charming young Widow I meet in the train<p>The Widow and I side by side sat together<br>The carriage containing ourselves and no more;<br>When silence was broken by my fair companion<br>Who enquired the time by the watch that I wore;<br>I of course satisfied her, and then conversation<br>Was freely indulged in by both, till my brain<br>Fairly reeled with excitement, I grew so enchanted<br>With the charming young Widow I met in the train<p>We became so familiar I ventured to ask her<br>How old was the child that she hell at her breast,<br>A sir, she responded, and into tears bursting,<br>Her infant still closer convulsively pressed,<br>When I think of my child I am well nigh distracted<br>Its father, my husband, oh my heart breaks with pain<br>She choking with sobs lean'd her head on my breast,<br>Did the charming young Widow I met in the train<p>By this time the train had arrived at the station<br>Within a few miles of the great one in town,<br>When, ray charmer exclaimed as she looked through<br>the Window,<br>Good gracious alive; why there goes Mr Brown,<br>He's my late husband's brother, dear sir would you<br>kindly<br>My lost beloved child for a moment sustain.<br>Of course I complied, then off on the platform<br>Stepped the charming young&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Widow I met in the<br>train<p>Three minutes elapsed when the Guards whistle<br>sounded,<br>The train began moving?no Widow appeared,<br>I bawled out,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Stop, stop, but they paid no attention<br>With a snort and a jerk starting off as I feared.<br>In this horrid dilemma I sought for the hour?<br>But my watch !  ha ! where was it, where, where<br>was my chain ?<br>My purse too, my ticket, gold pencil-case all gone !<br>Oh ! that artful young Widow I met in the train.<p>While I was my loss thus so deeply bewailing,<br>The train again stopped and I tickets, please, heard<br>So I told the Collector, while dandling the infant,<br>The loss I'd sustained, but be doubted my word<br>He called more officials, a lot gathered round me,<br>Uncovered the child, oh! how shall I explain<br>For behold, 'twas no baby, 'twas only a dummy !<br>Oh! that crafty young Widow I met in the train.<p>Satisfied I'd been robbed, they allow'd my departure<br>The of course I had settle my fare the next day ;<br>And I now wish to counsel young men from country<br>Lest they should get served in a similar way ;<br>Beware of young Widows you meet on the Railway,<br>Who lean on your shoulder, whose tears fall like rain<br>Look out for your pockets?in case they resemble<br>The charming young Widow I met in the train</p>
