	<p> TWO DIFFERENT RAPES.<p>A Particular Account of the Trial and Sentence of JOHN MIL-<br>LER, WILLIAM STORRIER and WM. ROBERTSON, for<br>two different Rapes, of a most horrid nature, and committed at<br>different times, who is to be Executed at Cupar in Fife, on the<br>31st of October next.<p>At Perth, on Friday the l8th September, 1822, John Miller and William Storrier. ac<br>used of the crime of an assault, with intent to commit a rape on a girl about 14 years of<br>age in the neighbourhood of Glammis, on the 5th of May last, were placed at the bar.?<br>he Court was cleared, and the prisoners pleaded Not Guilty.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A considerable number of<br>witnesses were examined for the prosecation, as were likewise a number in exeulpation on<br>behalf of the pannels.<p>Mr Hope addressed the Court for the prosecution, and Mr Thomson for Miller and Storr-  <br>ier, after which the evidence was summed up by one of their Lordships, and the jury<br>after having been enclosed for nearly an hour,  returned a verdict, by a plurality of voice,<br>finding the pannels guilty of an assault, with an intent to commit rape,<p>On Saturday the 11th, the Court met, and Miller and Storrier were again brought for<br>ward Mr Hope moved the judgment  of the Court, and Mr Thomson  a Liressed  it at con- .<br>siderable length in mitigation of punishment. Lord Hermand, in a speed, of great length<br>pointed out the aggravated nature of the crime of which the pannels had been convicted<br>and proposed that they should, in addition to the punishment of transportation, be whipped<br>through the town of Dundee.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  <p> Lord Succoth said, that the pannels had been both assisting in an attempt to commit this<br>brutal act. The occurrence was rare of two men being engaged in such a horrid crime,<br>and made it appear in a more disgusting light. There had been cases in which greater<br>marks of violence had been exhibited, but that would not, in any way, militate in their<br>favour. It was not necessary for the pannels to knock down the girl, because, from her<br>tender years, she was unable to resist the strength of two men. It was also proved, that<br>they had gone deliberately about their criminal purpose, by dragging the girl into a wood ;<br>this shows, that they were determined to effect, their object?the girl crying out and mak-<br>ing ail the resistance she could. It appeared in evidence, that the girl, who was only 14<br>years of age, continued in a state of fever for some days after. His Lordship conclude a,<br>by addressing the pannels in a most impressive manner, as to what ought to be the line of<br>conduct pursued by them after they should leave this country. The sentence of the Court<br>Was  read, ordaining Miller and Storrier to be publicly whipped thro' the town of Dundee,<br>on the 4th day of October next, and thereafter to be banished beyond seas for 14 years.<p>William Robertson, accused of a.similar act, was then put to the bar; the Court was<br>cleared, and was shut from 11 to past 7 o'clock at  night. In the course of that time, a<br>great number of witnesses, both tor the prosecution and in exculpation, were examined,?<br>The general outline of the evidence was understood to be, that the female, who lived near<br>Cupar Fife, had been violently assaulted, severely wounded, and actually ravished by the<br>pannel. After some pleading by the Counsel for the Crown and the prisoner, and the case<br>being summed up by one of their Lordships, the jury retired, and were enclosed for about<br>an hour, when they returned with a.verdict, finding, by a plurality of'voices, the pannel<br>guilty of rape, but unanimously and strongly recommended him to mercy.<p>Lord Succoth addressed Robertson in a short, but most energetic speech, stating that the<br>Court had no alternative but to pass the last sentence of the law. Lord Hermand also made<br>a few observations on the nature and enormity of the offence, and concluded by sentencing<br>Robertson to be Hanged at Cupar Fife, on the 31st October next.<p>The prisoner heard the awful doom pronounced with great composure and.firmness.?-<br>He was a good looking middle aged man, and has a family. .<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  W. Carse, Printer, Glasgow</p>
