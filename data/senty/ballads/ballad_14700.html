	<p> CONFESSION<p>Of JAMES WILSON, who was  Hanged at Glasgow on Wednesday last,<br>4th June, 1823, giving an account of upward of  30 different Robberies committed<br>by, him in Glasgow, Paisley, Greenock, and other parts of the country; the whole<br>communcated by Wilson to one of the Ministers of this City, a few days before his<br>Execution,<p>(From the Glasgow Chronicle.)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <p>Mr. Editor?The following truly affecting account I received an the 30th May<br>instant, in one of the Iron rooms of the common prison of this city, from James<br>M'Lusky, otherwise Wilson. If you think it might serve to deter others from such<br>an unhappy course of conduct, it is at your service.<br>May 31st, 1823.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;JAMES STUART, Minister.<p>" My parents belonged to the North of Ireland and prosessed the religion of the<br>Church of Rome, About 20 years ago they came to this contry, and resided at<br>Lochwinnoch, where I, the unfortunate James M'Clusky, was born, (for that was<br>my proper name,) and am sorry to relate that my father and mother lived a very<br>disagreeable and unhappy life, and about 10 years past they parted: my father then<br>took up with a woman of bad morale; and, awful to relate, one day after drinking<br>spirits with her, he was found dead in a field. My mother then removed to Barr-<br>head and from thence to Linwood, and from that to Blantyre, where, at an early<br>period, I indulged those baneful inclinations that led me to covet and take that<br>which was not my own. This pernicious propensity waxing, being in Greenock I<br>got 6 days of Bridewell for stealing a little sugar. After this I stopped with a<br>game-keeper in Lochwinnoch, and having shot some game", I sold them for my<br>own use I therefore had  to make my escape, and I came to Glasgow, and form-<br>ing an acquaintance with a lad named Johnston, we were dirnking spirits in a spirit<br>cellar with a woman of bad same, when a dispute arose, and I was taken to the Po-<br>lice Office and sentenced to be confined in Jail for ten days. After my emancipa-<br>tion, Johnston and I stole some lead, and with the reward of iniquity I spent that<br>night in a house of ill fame, and this licentious and sinful procedure helped to weave<br>the web of nay destruction. From that time I wrought no more with my hands to<br>provide things honest in the sight of God and man, but gave myself to work vice<br>with greediness; so that now I grew so hardened in sin, that I neither feared God<br>nor regarded man. I remember with bitter regret, of breaking into a gentleman's<br>house on the Paisley road and taking 7 silver table spoons, and 7 tea spoons and<br>several other articles of value. In summer last I committed a robebry at Renfrew.<br>I entered a gentleman's house, and finding the family fast asleep, I went from room<br>to room, and carried some valuable articles away. In this city, where I am now<br>surrouuded with iron, I had the audacity to snatch from a gentleman's pocket his<br>watch. Hearing of a fair in Tarbert, with some nearly as bold in the cause, we<br>went, there, and spent our time in theiving, picking pockets, drinking, &c. I<br>then went to Paisley,was suspected, and committed to Jail for 3 days Immedi-<br>ately I broke into the Porter's Lodge, for which I was banished from this county,<br>Rushing rapidly to destruction, I observed the guard of a coach sitting with the<br>driver, when I seized the opportunity, and bo e away a band box, with its contents,<br>shortly after I took another watch from a man that was intoxicated; and also two<br>notes from a man with whom I had spent the night in debauching. I was then ap-<br>prehended and whipped -this I got for my new year's gift, and nothing the better.<br>One more whipped, end still worse I grew, and alas, whipped again; and though<br>imprisoned, scourged and banished, all was abortive Having formed an acquaint-<br>ance  with A. R. we committed several robberies, and, last of all, I committed<br>that for which I was sentenced to die,<p>"The whole of my life has been one continued scene of misfortune and sin.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I<br>acknowledge before Almighty God that my sins are more in number than the hairs<br>of my head-that they are grievous to me, and a burden intolerable to be borne. <br>Sin to me, yes, my great sin is bitterness and bondage,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I look up  to  God  alone<br>for mercy and pardon, through Jesus Christ, and sincerely pity all those that, would<br>or do put their trust in deceiving man.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I wish from the bottom of my heart, that<br>all who may read this account, or hear of it, or may see me suffer the last stroke of<br>the rigid law, may take warning by, me; and particularly I charge the young of this<br>city to remember to kee the holy Sabbath-day, to keep good company, to read them<br>Bible. te attend the church, and, above all, to give their hearts to that God that<br>I so long dispised, so that felicity may atend them, is the prayer of <p>JAMES M. CLUSKY"<p>Printed by John Muir, Glasgow.</p>
