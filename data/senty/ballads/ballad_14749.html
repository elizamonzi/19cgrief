	<h2>Transcription</h2>
	<p> Murder of Betsy Smith.<p>COME all false hearted youug men and listen to my song,<br>It's of a dreadful murder that lately has been done ;<br>On the body of a damsel fair, the truth I will unfold,<br>the bare relation of this deed will make your blood run cold.<p>Near Manchester in Lancashire, this damsel she did dwell,<br>In service she long time had lived, till this to her befel ;<br>Her cheeks were like the blushing rose all in the month of May.<br>Until this wicked young man these words to her did say.<p>"Betsy my charming creature you have my heart ensnar'd ."<br>And with solemn vows and promises his love he oft declared ,<br>Till by his false deluding tongue poor Betsy was beguiled,<br>And soon to her misfortune great, by him she proved with child.<p>On the nineteenth day of August this young man did repair,<br>Unto the town of Manchester, to meet his Betsy there ;<br>Says, "Betsy, dear, come let us walk down in the flowery grove,<br>And there the secrcts of my heart to you I will disclose.<p>But 0 this wicked young man a knife he did provide,<br>And all unknown to his true love concealed it by his side ;<br>When to the fatal spot they came he thus to her did say.<br>"All on this night, within this grove. I will your life betray."<p>On bended knees she then did fall in sorrow and despair.<br>And loud for mercy she did call?her cries did rend the air ;<br>With clasped hands and uplift eyes, she cried  'O spare my life.<br>And I never will ask of you to make me your weded wife."<p>O then this wicked young man said, "no mercy will I show,"<br>Then took the knife all from bis side & pierced her body through<br>But still she smiling said to him, though trembling with fear,<br>"Oh ! Thomas, Thomas, spare my life ! think on your baby dear.<p>Twice more then withthe fatal knife he pierced her body through<br>Her throat was cut from ear to ear, most dreadful for to view ;<br>Her arms and hands and beautious face he cut and mangled so,<br>Whiledown uponher lillywhite breast the crimson blood did flow.<p>Then soon this young man taken was and unto prison sent,<br>In rattling chains he is confined his crimes for to lament;<br>Until the assizes do come on, where trembling he must stand,<br>To answer for the deed he's done, waiting the dread command.<p>Robert M'Intosh, Printer, Stationer,<br>Librarian, &c.,  96 King St. Calton,<br>Glasgow.</p>
