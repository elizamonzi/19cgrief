	<p> The Gillmertoun Vulcan gone,<p>who  hew'd seven Fire-Rooms in a single stone:<p>O R,<p>An E L E G Y on George Paterson Smith, Good-Man<br>of the famous Gillmertoun Caves.<p>INgenious George, at last alace thou'rt gone,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To lodge in Clay and left thy hollow Stone:<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ah me! Could not thy sturdy Wills of Rock,<p>Resist Deaths Darts and disappoint the Stroak;<br>Or coud'lt thou not thy Dest'ny to prevent,<br>Have cudgel'd Death by Dint of Argument:<br>for what could Death further of thee require;<br>Long since subjected to his dark Empire; <br>And sure in  might be very well aver'd,<br>One's fairly dead that's seven Years inter'd.<br>Well Sirs, what shall we say of honest George,<br>His learning Parts, his curious Cave and Forge,<br>For's Mem'rys Cause kind Reader it you please,<br>Let's have a little Hint at each of these.<br>George was no Man of many Letters, yet<br>He had a mighty Stock of Mother-Wit,<br>And tho' not taught in Geometrie at Schools,<br>Nor well acquaint with Euclid's learned Rules;<br>Yet here we are oblig'd t'observe his Knowledge,<br>An meas'ring Superficials and Sollids,<br>He con'd without Line, Compis, Rule or Pen,<br>Take the Dimsnsions of a Rock in's Brain,<br>Catrive what Rooms Square oblong, and so on<br>He con'd  cut out within a single Stone,<br>Which his prodigious Work will plainly tell,<br>To Travellers crouding to see his Cell.<br>E're Passengers approach'd his hollow Rock,<br>They from a far beheld th' ascending Smoak,<br>Thar surionsly did from his Forge arise,<br>Ano Æma like, clouded the neighbouring Skies.<br>Such Smoak from th' one cy'd Cyclop's Cave arose,<br>When forgoing Thunder with alternate Blows,<br>By Stairs hewn in firm Rock th' Enteire descends,<br>Which to the subteraneous Labyrinth tends:<br>Here the amaz'd&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Beholder's at a Stand,<br>Entries present themselves on every Hand,<br>To Kitchen, Dining, Drawing rooms apart,<br>Cut in the Rock with most ingenious Art,<br>And as with Wonder forward we advance,<br>In the meand'rings of a volted Trance ;<br>Apartment do appear on every Side,<br>Nicely contriv'd, which Craigie Walls divide:<br>To crown the Comforts of this curious Cell,<br>Deep in the Rock  here springs a pleasant Well,<br>By George's Hands, hewn with prodigious Pains,<p>Who's Water is refin'd in Rockie Veins.<br>No Furniture this dusky Cavern fills,<br>Or Timber fell'd on Cold Norvegian Hills ;<br>Nor doth its Roof rest upon Beams of Oak,<br>but sturdy Pillars of substantial Rock.<br>Here Roof, Walls, Floor and Furniture are one,<br>  All nicely cut in ne'er decaying Stone,<br>Which doubtless here have untransported stood,<br>Since Father Adam's Day e're Noah's Flood :<br>Unshaken too they stoutly seem to stand,<br>Scorning Times, all devouring Teeth or Hand,<br>And yet it's evident there's not  one small<br>Stone standing 'bove another in its Wall.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  <br>Thus how he form'd his House is hard to say,<br>By bearing down and throwing Stones away,<br>Beds Tables, Chairs, are Moveables you know,<br>George's House you'd hardly find it so.<br>You cannot here be Quarrels e'er so great,<p>Nor can ye tho' design'd his Heels to Trip;<br>Kick off the Chair to give his Bum the Slip ;<br>Nor can his Dame (Xantipe like) at Dinner,<br>O'erturn the Table with his Belly Timber,<br>Thus here you hardly can insirnge the Pace,<br>Unless against a Rock you run your Face.<br>To Poind his Goods he Meslengers might Mock',<br>They'd necd Concurrence to transport a Rock;<br>'Tis perfect Proof 'gainst Roberie and Thift,<br>There's little here that humane Hands can lift,<br>And Men you know may to a Thief afford,<br>The Charge of Millstones if they are unbor'd.<br>Deservedly it may be deem'd a Place,<br>Of Safety too in War as well as Peace;<br>'Gainst it what can the fiercest Foe perform,<br>'Tis Proof 'gainst bombing Battery or Storm:<br>So situate it cou'd sustain no Hurt,<br>From all th' Artillery in maiden Fort;<br>Castles on Rocks securely stand 'tis thought,<br>Securer this which in firm Rock is wrought,<br>Upon its sturdy Root in vain doth beat,<br>The Winter Tempest or the Summer Heat.<br>From blust'ring North Winds free and falling Rain,<br>Insurrance Tickets too wou'd be in vain:<br>Nature and Art together here conspite,<br>To mock the Floods and disappoint the Fire,<br>Thus dwelt the ancient Warlick Pios of Old,<br>Rocks were their Refuge, Rocks their strongest Hold<br>His Muse great Hautbornden did ost invock,<br>And breath'd his machless Lays from such a Rock;<br>And th' Oracles, which to the Ancients spoke,<br>Gave their Responces from some reverend Rock.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>Papists to prove their Errors Orthodox,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<p>Build Churches over Caves cut in firm Rocks,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  <br>And thus with pious Tricks Priestriden Folls&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>they Cox.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  <p>George to his Neighbour show'd his generous Love,<br>Liv'd under Ground t afford them Room above,<br>Thus he by far bewray'd a nobler Spirit,<br>Than Men who mighty Tracks of Land inherite,<br>Which they inclose make hudge Depopulation,<br>And wish they could monopolize the Nation,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>judging it would much more augument their Stock<br>To banish Man and multiply their Flocks,<br>The Use of Arms they then would teach their Cat<br>To save their Bacon in the Day of Battle.<br>All Day his Hammers made the Grotto groan,<br>And nightly when the toilsome Day was gone,<br>He Vulcan like, lay on a Couch of S one;<br>Stone too instead of Courtains do inviron,<br>Stone is its Stead as Anaks was of Iron.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.<p>From off his House he are the Thatch for Food,<br>And blest his Stars and call'd the Product good<br>Like old Diegenes in his Tub Castle,<br>He sat and crack't as crouseas will of Wastle,<br>Repeating with a graceful Air each Motto,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  <br>By Bards composed on his carious Grotto.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  <br>But ah! at last grim Death espy'd poor George,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  <br>Pent in his secret subteraneous Forge,<br>And laid him lifeless with a fatal Drub,<br>As Hercules did Cacus with his Club.<p>F&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;N&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;S.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
