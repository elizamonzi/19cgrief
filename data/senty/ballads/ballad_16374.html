	<p> THE  PERPETUAL&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ALMANACK !!!<p>OR,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;GENTLEMAN&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SOLDIER'S&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;PRAYER-BOOK,<p>Showing how one Richard Middleton was taken before the Mayor of the City he was in, for using <br>Cards in Church during Divine Service: being a Droll, Merry, Humorous Account of an<br>Odd affair that happened to a Private Soldier in the 60th Regiment of Foot.<p>THE Serjeant commanded his party to the church, and<br>when the Parson had ended his prayer. he took his<br>text; and all of them that had a Bible. pulled it out to<br>find the text, but this soldier had neither Bible, Al-<br>manack, nor Common Prayer- Book, but he put his<br>hand in his pocket and pulled out a pack of Cards, and<br>spread them before him as he sat, and while the parson<br>was preaching he first kept looking at one card and<br>then at another The Serjeant of the company saw<br>him. and said, Richard, put up your cards, for this is<br>no place for them. Never mind that, said the soldier,<br>for you have no business with me here.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  <p>When the parson had ended his sermon, and all was<br>over, the soldiers repaired to the church-yard, and the<br>commanding officer gave the word of command to fall<br>in, which they did  The Serjeant of the city came and<br>took the man prisoner. Man you are my prisoner,<br>said he. Sir, said the soldier, what have I done that I<br>am your prisoner? You have played a game of cards<br>in the church. No, said the soldier, I have not played<br>a game, for I only looked at a pack. No matter for<br>that, you are my prisoner. Where must we go, said<br>the soldier. Yon must go before the mayor, said the<br>Serjeant.<p>So he took him before the mayor and when they came<br>to the mayor's house, he was at dinner. When he had<br>dined, he came to them and said, well, serjeant, what<br>do you want with me. I have brought a soldier before<br>your honour for playing at cards in the church. What,<br>that soldier ? Yes. Well, soldier, what have you to say<br>for yourself? Much sir. I hope Well and good, but<br>if you have not, you shall be punished the worst that<br>ever man was Sir, said the soldier, I have been five<br>weeks upon the march, and have had but little to sub-<br>sist on, and am without either Bible, Almanack, or<br>Common Prayer book, or any thing but a pack of cards,<br>I hope to satisfy your honour of the purity of my<br>intention.<p>Then the soldier pulled out of his pocket the pack<br>of cards, which he spread before the mayor, and then<br>began with the ace.<p>When I see the ace, said he. it puts me in mind that<br>there is one God only ; when I see the deuce, it puts<br>me in mind of the Father and the Son ; when I see the<br>trey, it puts me in mind of the Father, Son, and Holy<br>Ghost; when I see the four, it puts me in mind of the<br>four Evangelists that preached the gospel, viz Matthew,<br>Mark, Luke, and John; when I see the five, it puts<br>me in mind of the five wise virgins that trimmed their<br>lamps; their were ten, but five were foolish, who were<br>shut out; when I see the six it puts me in mind that<br>in six days the Lord made heaven and earth ; when I<br>see the seven. It puts me in mind that on the seventh<br>day God rested from all the works which he had created<br>and made wherefore the Lord blessed the seventh day<br>and hallowed it; when I see the eight it puts me in<br>mind of the eight righteous persons that were saved<br>when God drowned the world, viz, Noah, his wife,<br>three sons, and their wives ; when I see the nine, it<br>puts me in mind of nine lepers that were cleansed by<br>our Saviour; there were ten, but nine never returned<br>God thanks ; when I see the ten it puts me in mind of<br>the ten commandments that God gave Moses on Mount<br>Sinai, on the two tables of stone.<p>He took the knave and laid it aside.<p>When I see the queen, it puts me in mind of the<br>Queen of Sheba, who came from the furthermost parts<br>of he world to hear the wisdom of King Solomon, and<br>who was as wise a woman as he was a man : for she<br>brought fifty boys and fifty-girls all clothed in boys<br>apparel, to show before King Solomon, for him to tell<br>which were boys and which were girls ; but he could<br>not until he called for water for them to wash themselves,<br>the girls washed up to their eibows and the boys only<br>up to their wrists, so King Solomon knew by that.<br>And also of Queen Victoria, to pray for her And<br>when I see the king, it puts me in mind of the great<br>King of Heaven and Earth, who is God Almighty.<p>Well, said the mayor, you have given a very good<br>description of all the cards except one, which is lack-<br>ing. What is that? said the soldier. The knave,<br>said the mayor. Oh, I can give your honour a good<br>description of that, if your honour won't be angry. No,<br>I will not, says the mayor, if you will not term me the<br>knave.<p>Well, said the soldier, the greatest that I know of is<br>the serjeant of the city that brought me here. I don't<br>know, said the mayor. that he is the greatest knave,<br>but I am sure he is the greatest fool.<p>I shall now show your honour how I use the cards<br>as an almanack. You certainly are a clever fellow,<br>said the mayor, but I think you'll have a hard matter<br>to make that appear.<p>When I count how many spots there are in a pack<br>of cards, I find there are three hundred and sixty-five,<br>there are as many days in the year.<p>Stop, said the mayor, that is a mistake. I grant it,<br>said the soldier, but as I have never yet seen an almanack<br>that was thoroughly correct in all points, it would have<br>been impossible for me to in itate an almanack exactly<br>without a mistake. Your observations are very cor-<br>rect, said the mayor, go on. When I count how many<br>cards there are in a pack, I find there are fifty-two,<br>there are so many weeks in the year ; when I count how<br>many tricks there are in a pack, I find there are thirteen,<br>there are so many months in a year. You see, sir, that<br>this pack of cards is a Bible, Almanack, Common<br>Prayer-book, and Pack of Cards to me.<p>Then the mayor called for a loaf of bread, a piece of<br>cheese, and a pot of good beer, and gave to the soldier<br>a piece of money, bidding him to go about his business,<br>saying, he was the cleverest man he had ever seen.<br>146</p>
