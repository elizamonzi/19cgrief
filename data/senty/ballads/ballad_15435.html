	<p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  EXECUTION!<p><p>A Full and Particular ACCOUNT of the Execution<br>of JOHN RENNIE and WILLIAM SUTHER-<br>LAND, who were EXECUTED at Edinburgh on<br>Wednesday morning, the 22d August, 1821, for<br>Housebreaking and Theft, with their Behaviour at<br>the place of Execution, &c.<p>THIS morning, Wednesday the 22d day of August, 1821, pur-<br>suant to their Sentence, these unfortunate young men, JOHN<br>RENNIE and WILLIAM SUTHERLAND, suffered the last pun-<br>ishment of the law, at the, now, ordinary place of Execution, Head<br>of Libberton Wynd, Edinburgh. They were tried before the High<br>Court of Justiciary, at Edinburgh, on Monday the 16th of July<br>last, for three separate acts of Housebreaking and Theft; the first,<br>in the house of Mrs Pattison, Leith Links?the second, in the<br>house of Mrs Ferrier, Portobello?and, the third, in the house of<br>Mrs Paterson, at Canaan, near Edinburgh. They were also charg-<br>ed with being habit and repute Thieves. After consulting with<br>their counsel, they pled Guilty of the second charge, and not Guil-<br>ty of the other two, or of the habit and repute. After Lord Gil-<br>lies, the presiding Judge, observed that no advantage could result to<br>them from this plea, on account of the Lord Advocate having pre-<br>viously stated, that whatever plea they meant to put in, he felt it<br>his duty to say, that, on account of the aggravated nature of their<br>case, he could not, in the proper discharge of his duty, restrict the<br>libel to an arbitrary punishment, the prisoners then retracted their<br>plea, and pled Guilty of the whole charges. They retracted again,<br>and pled not Guilty ; but, after the examination of an accomplice,<br>who clearly established their guilt in the robbery of Mrs Ferrir's<br>house at Portobello, Rennie pled Guilty of all the charges, and<br>Sutherland Guilty of the second and third. After being severall<br>addressed by Mr Maitland, for the prisoners, the Lord Advocate, and<br>Lord Gillies, the Jury unanimously found them Guilty, in terms of<br>their own confession. They were then sentenced to be Executed<br>at Edinburgh, on Wednesday morning the 22d of August, after an<br>earnest and solemn advice from Lord Gillies to prepare for the fate<br>which awaited them, as their case could not be recommended by<br>the Court to the seat of mercy for an alteration of the Sentence.<p>As no hopes of a commutation of the sentence, it is said, was<br>entertained, owing perhaps to the aggravated nature of their crimes,<br>as noticed by Lord Gillies when pronouncing the awful sentence,<br>the unfortunate young lads appeared perfectly resigned to their fate,<br>and very penitent, from the moment they were condemned. They<br>accordingly paid unremitting attention to the instructions and ad-<br>monitions communicated to them every day by the Chaplain of the<br>Jail, as well as by the other Clergymen of the City, and private<br>friends, some of whom regularly attended them since their condem-<br>nation, for which they appeared always grateful; and behaved with<br>great propriety during the whole of their confinement.<p>Accordingly, on Tuesday at 8 o'clock in the evening, they were<br>conveyed in a Coach from the Jail, on the Calton-hill, to the Lock-<br>up-house, Libberton Wynd, attended by Captain Sibbald and seve-<br>ral police-officers, where their irons were knocked off, and where<br>they spent the remainder of that night in taking farewell of several<br>friends and acquaintances, and in making every necessary prepara-<br>tion for the awful morrow morning. Two clergymen sat up with<br>them to a late hour, when they went to rest, and slept for a few<br>hours. They rose early in the morning, and were again waited on<br>by the Clergymen, with whom they conversed for a little time, and<br>one of whom, after a Psalm was sung, prayed with them very fer-<br>vently. A little past eight o'clock, the two Magistrates officiating<br>were announced, when their hands were severally pinioned, and<br>they were conducted up the Wynd to the Scaffold, each attended by<br>a Clergymen, with the Magistrates, preceded by the town-officers,<br>and guarded by a strong detachment of police-officers.<p>They appeared on  the scaffold, decently dressed,  at  half-past<br>eight o'clock, where two verses of a psalm was sung, in which they<br>both joined, after which the Reverend Mr Henry Grey prayed for<br>therm most fervently for a  short  time.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They then spoke a little,<br>and shook hands with several round them; after which they mount-<br>ed the fatal drop, and after praying for a short time, they shook<br>hands with one  another,  when the  caps  were drawn  over their<br>faces, upon which, in a minute or  two, one of them  dropt the sig-<br>nal, and they were instantly launched into eternity, amidst  a great<br>number of Spectators, a few minutes before nine o'clock.<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; PRICE ONE PENNY</p>
