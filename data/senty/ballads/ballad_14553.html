	<p> An Answer to the Assembly<br>of Bum-bees.<p>AS snarling Momus sung descenting Bees,<br>That in Assemblies sat to civilize,<br>A wand'ring Wasp who lately lost his Sting,<br>By soaring higher then he'd Strength of Wing.<br>The hine Seraphick struck the sacred Lyre,<br>And thus broke Silence with a Divine Air,<br>Amaz'd you Gods, may this terrestical Dome,<br>Fly to its Chaos and resign its Form,<br>May Man no Matters know, save what's meer Chance,<br>Or Meteors Measure in the vast Expanse,<br>Ere they acknowledge one Eternal Three,<br>Of equal Substance, and the same Degree,<br>Which sometime since a daring factious Drone<br>Deny'd, and thereby did demean the Son,<br>Glorying to grasp at what he cou'd not gain,  <br>And meaning furder than he durst explain.<br>Thus Vice was vernish'd, when the very Bees<br>That should be Cautious were contriving Pleas,<br>And fought all Opportunities, to shew<br>Weak Wasp the wond'rous Worth and Wit of you,<br>Wildly inferring that infamous Creed<br>Of yours, but Labour Would procure you Bread,<br>No could their Speeches silveriz'd Escape,<br>To gain you Credit in a Clergy Scap;<br>But seurious Pamphlets must applaud the Crime,<br>To prove how glorious you'd appear in Ryhme;<br>Where, had the Author been as wise as old,<br>He on the contrar would from Conscience told,<br>HOW you was hir'd with Honey to do harm,<br>The very worst Wasp in a Winter Swarm,<br>industrious e're to do redoubel'd Iils,<br>Which made a zealous Webster wave all else,<br>To wait this Wasp, who wilfully imprest<br>Black Heresy in ev'ry Bumbees Breast,<br>Till trap'd by Truth, he turns the counter Part,<br>And feigns Obedience foreign to his Heart,<br>A happy Change, hear me you humming Cleg,<br>May this Impression ever with you bide;<br>But ah not long when learn'd Webster dies,<br>A Check to all erroneous idle Bees,<br>This Wasp relapses, and's again arrign'd,<br>For Bum Blasphemous Babbels he maintain'd,<br>And was held furth by all the Hum-drum Scribes.<br>(Who of him makes a Master-bee for Bribes,)<br>As one entirely innocent and free,<br>From Faults that's fattal, but a feather'd Bee,<br>While better's branded with the Name of Bums,<br>'Cause none of blust'ring Bellial's Bastard Sons;<br>But since perhaps it was the Author's Aim,<br>That we thus read the Reverse of his Theme,<br>Madder for milder Divine Bees for Drones,<br>Let's cease since Heaven has shut his Mouth for once.<p>F I N I S.</p>
