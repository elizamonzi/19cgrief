	<h2>Transcription</h2>
	<p> COPY of a very interesting Letter which was received in Glas-<br>gow on Wednesday last from Andrew White, at Botany Bay,<br>who was engaged in the Battle of "Bonnymuir, giving<br>a particular account of the situation of himself and his com-<br>panions; and many other interesting particulars respecting<br>that now respectable Colony.<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Paramatta, (New South Wales), May 8th 1822.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" My Dear Friend,<br>" I received your letter, and was happy to hear that you was in good health,<br>thank God as this leaves me in the same, you mentioned to me that you had not<br>received my letter, but my dear friend, I was not so neglectful as not to remember<br>you. I am still with the same master whom I went to when I left England. I am<br>his Butler and has every thing under my charge, so that the greatest confidence<br>is put in me; I want for nothing that is within his house. I get money when I<br>want it, in short I am more comfortable than when in Scotland. I see great num-<br>bers of Scotch people here both prisoners and free people. I see Glasgow News-<br>papers often, but I can see nothing concerning Bonnymuir.<p>"I shall now say a few words concerning the Colonists; when a man comes to<br>the Colony he is taken under the charge of the Government, when he is allowed<br>14lbs. of fine flour, and 7 lbs. of fresh beef per week, and Saturday to himself?<br>When three years in the Colony, be by application, may get a ticket of leave to go<br>and work for himself; and a man, when highly recommended, gets emancipation,<br>and can then go any where in the country, provided he behaves himself; in fact,<br>there is every indulgence to good behaviour. A free settler is of course entitled to<br>all the rights and privileges of a British subject at home.<p>" The climate is wholesome, and abounds with fruit of every description; we have<br>got an orchard as large as half the Drygate, which contains oranges, peaches,<br>grapes, figs, and all the other fruits which are to be found at home. There are<br>now five or six pretty large towns here. This place (Paramatta), is about as large<br>as Anderston, and my master is Magistrate of it at present, but we expect to go<br>down to Sydney every day.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have had several illuminations, here lately.<p>" My sentence has been mitigated to seven years, and my master and mistress<br>has promised to bring me home with them; so these things keep me in good spirits,<br>and I slatter myself with the hope that I shall soon see you again, when we will<br>spend another New-year's day morning, singing, " Scots wha hae wi' Wallace bled,"<br>or " Auld lang syne," or " Willie brew'd a peck o' maut."<p>" All the men of our party are in good health at present, and are all very com-<br>fortable. Alexander Hart is going to be married to one of our servant girls; Thos.<br>M'Culloch is overseer to Capt. Irvin; Gray and Latimer are at Van Dieman's Land;<br>Pink and Thomson I have seen often, and when they come here they are always<br>made welcome by my master."&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; '<p>Another letter from one of the above party mentions the safe arrival of Mrs. M'-<br>Leod and family, who joined her husband in the month of April last.<p>Extract of another letter from Van Dieman's Land, dated 10th April, 1822<br>" Is it not infamous to see that convict, John M'Dougall, of ship-sinking noto-<br>riety, walking about here like a gentleman, and advertising in the Newspapers for<br>business as a general agent and accountant? When the ship arrived with him, he<br>was brought ashore by the Governor's boat, separate from the other prisoners, in<br>plain clothes, instead of the convict dress (of yellow cloth) so as to save his feelings.<br>He pretends that he has not a stiver in the world, and that he was preparing to send<br>home documents to prove who were the guilty parties?a post too late for himself<br>however,"&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Printed by John Muir, Glasgow.</p>
