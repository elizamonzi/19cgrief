	<p> The WONDER of WONDERS<p>B E I N G<p> A strange and wonderful Relation concerning the Mermaid that was seen and spoke with on the Cliff of<br>Cromarry, near Inverness in Scotland, by a young Gentleman, a Merchant, named Lauchland Mac-<br>kintosh, who was tossed on the main 'Ocean for four Days and Nights, Together with an account of<br>his wonderful Dream, and the strange Conversation he had with the Mermaid, and how he was preser-<br>Ved, but died in five Days after his Return to Inverness.<p>ON the Twenty-fifth of June last, one Mr.<br>JAMES FORBES, Captain and Command-<br>er of the Ship call'd the Dolphin, in her pas-<br>sage for Amsterdam in Holland, was beat back by<br>a. tempestuous Wind ; but all the Men got safe on<br>Shore, except a young Gentlemen, a Merchant,<br>Call'd Lauchland Mackintosh, who was taken very<br>ill, and f'ast asleep on board of the Ship, was left<br>to the Almighty's Providence, and to the Mercies<br>of the Seas and Wind, until at length he awaked<br>in a great dread, tossing on the main Ocean, and<br>frighted with dreadful dreams: For the said Lauch-<br>land Mackintosh dream'd, that he was upon the<br>top of a high Mountain, whose top, he thought<br>reached to the Heavens Firmament, or Skies ; and<br>that there was on the top of the Mountain an ex-<br>ceeding fine Castle, about the Circumference of a<br>Mile, and furnished with all Sorts of fine Dia-<br>monds and precious Stones, and a Well, whose<br>Water was as sweet as Honey, and white as Milk,<br>that whosoever drank of that Well should never be<br>dry again; and all sorts of fine musick very delightful<br>to hear, so that they would think, as he supposed,<br>seven Years not so long as a Day in that Place.<p>After having viewed the Castle round, he obser-<br>ved to his great Admiration a beautiful young La-<br>dy, who was guarded by seven Serpents, very fright-<br>ful to behold. Suppose the young Lady was very<br>beautifull. yet he wished rather to be a thousand<br>Miles off than in the fight of those Serpents : And<br>looking round about, he espy'd (to his great com-<br>fort) a green Gate, and a Street pav'd with blue<br>Marble, which open'd at his coming to it, and so<br>he got away from the Serpents : But coming to<br>the Top of the Hill did not know how to get<br>down, it being very high and steep, but he found<br>a Ladder to his Comfort; it being very slender was<br>afraid to venture, but at last was obliged to make<br>Use of it, for one of the Serpents having taken<br>notice of him, pursued him so very hard, that he<br>was in great danger, and thought he fell and broke<br>his right Leg, and that the Serpent fell upon him,<br>which awakened him in a great fright, and almost<br>-made him mad.<p>But by this you most think what great trouble he was<br>in, awaking alone On the main Ocean, when missing<br>all the rest of the Ship's Crew, and likewise the<br>great danger he was in : But to his great Amaze-<br>ment espied a beautiful young Lady (as he thought)<br>combing her head.and tossing on the Billows,cloathed<br>all in Green, (but by Chance he got the first word<br>of her) with a Smile the comes on board, and in<br>Latin asked how he did. The young man being<br>something smart, and a Scholar, replied, Madam, I<br>am (the better to see you in good Health) in great<br>hopes trusting you will be a Comfort and Assistance<br>to me in my low Condition, and so caught hold of<br>her Comb and green Girdle that was about her<br>Waist, To which she replied, Sir. you ought not<p>to rob a young Woman of her Riches, and then<br>expect a Favour at her Hand ; but if you 1) give me<br>my Comb and Girdle again, what lies in my Power<br>I will do for you. . At which Time he had no<br>Power to keep them from her, but mediately de-<br>liver'd them up again. She then smiling thanked<br>him, and told him, If he would meet her against<br>next Friday, she would set him safe on shore. He<br>had no Power to deny her, but readily gave his<br>Consents At which time she gave him a Compass,<br>and desired him steer South West. He thanked<br>her, and told her he wanted some News, he said<br>she would tell him the next Occassion, when he<br>fulfilled his Promise; but he should find his Father<br>and Mother much grieved about him; and so jump-<br>ing into the Sea, she departed out of his sight.<p>After her Departure the Tempest ceased, and<br>blew a fair Gale to South West, and he got safe on<br>the Shore. But when he Came to his Fathers house,<br>he found every thing as she had told him : For she<br>told him also concerning his being left on Ship-<br>board, and how ail the Seamen got safe to Land,<br>and he found it all true what she had told him, ac-<br>cording to the Promise she made him. He was still<br>very much troubled in his mind how to perform.<br>his Promise; but mind, while he was thus muling,<br>she appeared to him with a smiling Countenance,'<br>and (by his Misfortune) she got .the first Word of<br>him, so that he could not speak one Word, but<br>was quite dumb, yet he took Notice of what<br>Words she spoke; and thus she began to sing:<p>When the white Hart comes to Inverness,<br>What will befal no Man can guess :<br>'Tis true King George he rules the Land,<br>And he hath Men at his Command.<p>King George he likewise ruleth high.<br>And he hath many an Enemy;<br>Yet he will over rule them all,<br>And make their Pride to have a Fall.<p>And after these Debates shall cease,<br>Old England then will be at peace ;<br>The'll have no Reason to complain,<br>Trading will flourish once again.<p>Upon which she departed out of the young man's<br>fight, taking from him the Compass. She took a<br>Ring from off her Finger, and put it upon the<br>young Man's Finger, and said, she expected to<br>see him once again with more Freedom, but he<br>never saw her more : Upon which he came to him-<br>self again, went home, was taken very ill, and<br>died in five Days after, to the wonderful Admira-<br>tion of all People who heard and saw the young<br>Gentleman,<p>F&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;N&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I  S.</p>
