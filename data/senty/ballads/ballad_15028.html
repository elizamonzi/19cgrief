	<p> THE STORM ON THE PAISLEY CANAL<p>PRICE ONE PENNY.<p>Copies can always be had at the Poet's Box, 190 and 192 Overgate, Dundee.<p>Tune?Original.<p>Pray look on this victim of Cupid,<br>Tae.laiy tale qf woe give an ear,<br>As sure as death I'm knocked quite stupid,<br>I'll gang wrang in the head tae, I fear,<br>An' it's a' through a lass that I gaed wi',<br>Ay, Mary M'Phail was her name;<br>My affections she has cruelly played wi'<br>And left me like a wandered wean.<p>Spoken__Aye, mony a&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;time I hae laughed<br>committin' suicide through love but there's nae-<br>body kens the impression it leaves when your<br>lass laves you. I ken mony a time  I hae fun' <br>mysol'daunering owre by Jamaica Brig&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;wi'  the<br>second consideration when I thoucht'on the<br>trouble it would gie ither fouk, fairly spile my<br>claes, an' May be catch cauld, I thoucht it would<br>be as us weel tae never mind. Aye, Mary M'Phail<br>hasna failed tae mak' me fail plenty.<p>CHORUS.<p>I wish that I never had seen her,<br>She has cruelly caused my doonfa'<br>She's awa' wi' the mate o' a steamer<br>That sailed on the Paisley Canal<p>Ye mann ken that her parents resided<br>In that famous place Paisley toon,<br>Tae first-fit them we baith had decided<br>She said wi' the train she was tired,<br>And would like tae gang doon by the sea,<br>So a berth for us baith I then hired<br>In the Crossmyloof steamshib "Bumbee."<p>Spoken.-Ay, freens, I spared nae expense <br>tae mak' her comfortable, I took a cabin pas-<br>sage in that late and commodious steamship<br>O' twa hunder punds burthen, the "Bumbee,'t<br>o' Crossmyloof. And before starting that nich<br>I bocht a bottle o' the hard stuff, nane o' the<br>"Weekly Mail" kind, mind ye, but the rale Glen-<br>tak'it, some curran' scones, some potted head,<br>some wulks, and several ither luxuries. I took<br>ane last look o' the shore o' Glesca, a carter<br>gied us a shove aft', and awa' we started,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but  I<br>micht hae kent there wis something gaen tae <br>tak place for before we left the Quay there<br>wis a punt lying opposite tae us wi' a lot o'<br>man-o-war sailors on board, and they  aye&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;kept<br>winking at Mary, and she seemed It 'ke it.<p>When passing the Shaws a great storm<br>Wi terrible f ury cam on<br>I got my Sunday troosers r torn,<br>And Mary she lost her chignon.<br>I thocht I wad faint wi alarm,<br>When, A hauns on deck, the Captain roared,<br>And the crew was a chap wi' yae arm,<br>He says, Throw "the main deck overboard.<p>We hadno gaen far up the channel<br>When we felt such a thunderin shock,<br>The Captain gaed aff wi a candle.<br>And found out we had struck on a rock.<br>I lost Mary amidst a,' the commotion.<br>On a flour barrel I sprang across,<br>And by chance was rescuedf rom the ocean,<br>By a passing punt loaded with dross.<p>Spoken. ?There was a nice predicament tae<br>be in. Talk aboot first-fittinn, I wis bobbin<br>about for three or four hours on the briny ocean<br>whustlin wi my fingers in my Mooth&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;as a signal<br>o' distress, but atlast one o' Drummonds Gov- <br>ernment screws cam in sicht, but they either<br>took me for a buoy, or else the spirit o tha storm<br>and were frichted to tak me on board, but at<br>last they got convinced I was human being,<br>so they hove- to. and before you could count<br>three I was on board, and related my sad tale<br>tae the Captain. But I think a the Captains<br>Ere tarred wi then same stick, for he jist gies<br>his troosers a hitch up an he says. Avast,<br>you landlubber, the girl will be right enough.<br>She micht be richt enough for them she was<br>wi but no for me; but however I arrived back<br>frae whaur I started, a sadder but a wiser man<br>I met a the ither fouk gaun hame quite hapyy<br>singing the Days o Auld Lang Syne, and<br>Let us be happy together, but I had tae gang<br>hame singing intae mysel.<br>I wish that I never had seen her, etc.<p>I had jist been twa days hame tae a letter<br>Cam frae Mary that did mak me stare.<br>She said I should try and forget her<br>For she couldna see me ony mair<br>She got spliced the day after the storm<br>Tae the captali for saving her life,<br>So noo I'm left quite forlorn?<br>Daunerin aboot lookin oot for a wife.<p>Spoken.?Aye. the day I got that letter I<br>kent at ance it was frae Mary, I could aye tell<br>her han write, yo wad think it was wrote wi<br>the end o a potstick. It commenced wi, Dear<br>Bauldie (aye she was dear enough tae me ony <br>way, for the excursion cost me ane and fivepence <br>my hail years gatherin, no speakin o three<br>penc hapenny I spent wi her up at the shows<br>during the fair time), she says Dear Bauldie,<br>I hope youll no takit amiss o me marryin the-<br>Captain o the Bumbee, for what is to be<br>will be. During the tempest me an the mate<br>were picked up by a large troopship [&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;]<br>horse-power and carried back tae the [  ]<br>port o Strabungo. When without ony<br>hesitation, he asked me if l' would be his<br>partner for life, so I just said aye because him<br>saving my life I thouoht he had the richt tae<br>get me; so when the clergyman asked me if I<br>would tak him for better or worse, I said I<br>would tak him for the better the warst o't<br>bein disappointin you, but it canna be helped<br>noo. Im appointed stewardess on board ane<br>o the canal liners, so as there is to be a soiree<br>on board the nicht, an I hae tae attend a a party<br>o coalheavers, for the present I'll bid you an<br>everlasting fareweel, At tho fit o the letter<br>there was a P.S. (I suppose that meant Puir<br>Sowl), it said. If you come tae Strabungo<br>on Monday next I could get ye a job as pilot<br>tae pull up ane o the canal ironclads frae<br>Paisley every morning. But I would prefer<br>bein at my ain trade weavin at hame, ant<br>I wish that I never had seen her, etc'</p>
