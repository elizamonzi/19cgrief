	<p> A Full, True, and Particular Account of the Execution of AN-<br>DREW HARDIE and JOHN BAIRD, who were Hanged<br>and Beheaded at Stirling, on Friday the 8th September 1820,<br>for High Treason, together with their Behaviour at the<br>Place of Execution.<p>YESTERDAY, 8th September, 1820, the preparation for the execution of these<br>unfortunate men having been completed the previous night, this morn-<br>ing the scaffold appeared to the view of the inhabitants.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On each side the scaf-<br>fold was placed a coffin, at the head of which was a tub, filled with saw-dust,<br>destined to receive the head.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To the side of the tub was affixed a block.<p>The clergymen of the town (the reverend Drs Wright and Small,) and the reverend Mr Bruce,<br>throughout the confinement of the prisoners, were unremitting in their duties. The morning pre-<br>vious to the execution was spent almost solely in devotion and reflections, suited to the awful situa-<br>tion of the prisoners. About 11 o'clock a troop of the 7th Dragoon Guards arrived from Falkirk,<br>and were assisted by the 13th Foot quartered in the Castle.<p>At a quarter after one the procession left the Castle, and was seen to move<br>down Broad Street, the unfortunate men in a hurdle, their backs to the horse,<br>and the headsman with his axe sitting so as to face them. They were respect-<br>ably dressed in black, with weepers. The procession was attended by the<br>Sheriff-depute and his Substitute, and the Magistrates, all with their staves of<br>office. The troops lined the streets so as to permit the whole to pass slowly<br>and undisturbed to the spot intended for the execution. During the procession,<br>the prisoners sung a hymn, in which they were joined by the multitude.<p>At 20 minutes to two o'clock, the hurdle arrived at the Court-house. Hardie<br>first descended. He was followed by Baird, then the headsman. Hardie, by<br>mistake, was conducted into the waiting-room. He bowed twice respectfully to<br>the gentlemen who were present. The Reverend Dr Wright accompanied<br>Hardie. The Reverend Dr Small, and Mr Brown, were with Baird. Hardie<br>turned round, and observing how few persons were present, said to one of the<br>clergymen, " Is this all that is to be present." Dr Wright read the whole of<br>the 51st psalm. He then delivered a most impressive prayer; after which, a<br>few verses of the same psalm, from the 7th verse, were sung by the prisoners<br>and others present, Hardie giving out two lines at a time, in a clear and distinct<br>voice, and sung the same without any tremulency. The Reverend Dr Small<br>then delivered a prayer, remarkable for zeal and fervour ; after which, the 103d<br>psalm was sung, Hardie giving out two lines at a time as before.<p>The conduct of these two men while in the Court-room was most calm and<br>unassuming. Some refreshment being offered, Hardie took a glass of sherry,<br>and Baird a glass of port. Hardie said something the exact import of which we<br>could not collect. He begged the sheriff to express their gratitude to General<br>Graham, Major Peddie, and the public authorities, for their humanity and at-<br>tention ; he then bowed to the other persons present, and drank off the whole of<br>the contents of the glass. Baird then addressed himself to the sheriff, and beg-<br>ged to convey sentiments of a similàr nature. When they were pinioned Har-<br>die mentioned to Baird to come forward to the scaffold. While in the Court-<br>room both prisoners particularly Hardie, seemed less affected by their situation<br>than any other person present; his hand, while he held his book, never trem-<br>bled. On their arrival at the scaffold, there was a dead silence. After a few<br>minutes, Baird addressed the crowd in a very loud voice. He adverted to the<br>circumstance in which he was placed, and said he had but little to say, but that<br>he never gave his assent to any thing inconsistent with truth and justice. He<br>then recommended the bible, and a peaceful conduct to his hearers. Hardie then<br>addressed the crowd. He commenced with the word " Countrymen." At some-<br>ting which we could not completely catch, and which we must not guess at<br>there was a huzzaing, and marks of approbation. After a few moments silence<br>as if recollecting he had proceeded too far, and had excited feelings inconsistent<br>with his situation, he spoke again. He adised the crowd not to think of them,<br>but to attend to their bibles, and recommended them, in place of going to pub-<br>lic houses, to drink to the memory of Baird and Hardie, that they would retire<br>to their devotions. After the ropes were adjusted, a most warm and aflectionate<br>prayer was delivered by the reverend Mr Bruce. At eleven minutes before three<br>the necessary arrangements being made, Hardie gave the signal, when they were<br>launched into eternity. After hanging half an hour, they were cut down, and placed upon the cof-<br>fins, with, their  necks upon a block; the headsman then came forward ; he was a little man, appar-<br>ently about 18 years of age; he wore a black crape over his face, a hairy cap, and a black gown<br>On his appearance there was a cry of murder. He struck the neck of Hardie thrice before it was<br>severed ; then held it up with both hands, saying, " This is the head of a traitor." He severed the<br>head of Baird at two blows, held it up in the same, manner, and used the same words The coffin<br>were then removed, and the crowd peaceably dispersed.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<p>Edinburgh;?Printed for William Cameron,?PRICE ONE PENNY.</p>
