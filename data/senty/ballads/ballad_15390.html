The<br>husband being in the habit, on his  return from work in the even-<br>ing of drinking a little tea or coffee from the teapot, she placed the<br>arsenic in this vessel among&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the coffee.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It stood&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;two nights with -<br>out tasting it;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but on the evening in  qnestion, he being rather dry,<br>and seeing the teapot upon  the&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;table,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;he asked her  if&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;she had any<br>thing for to drink? She  replied,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  "Eigh,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;there's  the pot; on<br>which he took it up, and drank heartily of its contents, Immedi-<br>ately after wards  he went ont , with the intention of going to the house<br>of a relation, but before  he arrived  he dropped down, and shortly<br>after expired. The wife being taken ,into custody, confessed&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;her<br>guilt, but added, with apparent confidence of safety, 'But  mind. <br>thought  I  put the stuft ioto the pot I did  not give it  to him.--he<br>took it himself '.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Examiner.<br>Forbes, Printer, Edinburgh.</p>
