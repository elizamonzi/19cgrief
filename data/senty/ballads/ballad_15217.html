	<p>   EXECUTION<p>OF<p>CHARLES DONALDSON, Sail-maker, Tolbooth Wynd, Leith,<br>who was Executed this morning, at the head of Libberton s<br>Wynd, for the Murder of Margaret Marr, his wife.<p>Edinburgh,  Monday, April 4,  1836.<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  THIS morning,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;soon after eight&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;o'clock,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Charles&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Donaldson,sail-maker, Leith, underwent the extreme penalty of the law,<br>upon a scaffold erected at the west corner of the County Hall, head<br>of Libberton's Wynd, for the murder of Margaret Marr, his wife,<br>by striking her repeatedly on the head with a frying-pan, on Mon-<br>day the 9th of November last, in consequence whereof she was<br>mortally wounded, and died on  the Wednesday following--afford-<br>ing another melancholy example of the misery and crime conse-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>quent upon the intemperate use of ardent spirits.<p>From the evidence adduced at his trial, which took place on the<br>14th of March last, it would appear that he and the deceased lived<br>very uncomfortably together, --she being much addicted to drinking,<br>for which he used frequently to beat her. On that fatal evening,<br>coming home from his work, he found his door locked on  the in-<br>side ;  and, borrowing a knife from a neighbour,  he pushed back<br>the lock and gained admittance, when he found his wife lying a-<br>sleep in bed, from which he pulled her out upon the floor, where<br>he kicked her severely with his feet, broke a bottle on her head,<br>and struck her repeatedly upon the head with a frying-pan, till<br>she became insensible.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The only words she was heard to utter<br>were, "Oh! Charlie, Charlie."&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In this state she was put to bed,<br>where she continued in a state of stupor, and died on Wednesday<br>evening.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The jury found a verdict of Guilty, but recommended<br>the prisoner to mercy ; and the awful sentence of death was pro-<br>nounced against him.<p>During his long confinement previous to his trial, the unhappy<br>culprit entertained strong hopes of acquital ; after his condemna-<br>tion, however, he became fully alive to his awful situation, indulg-<br>ing but very faint hopes of a respite through the jury's recommend-<br>ation to mercy, and lending the most serious attenion to the reli-<br>gious instructions of the worthy clergymen who attended him.<p>He was brought over to the Lock-up-house about ten o'clock<br>last night, where he was immediately waited upon by his spiritual<br>advisers, with whom he spent the greater part of the night in de-<br>votional exercises.<p>A little before eight o'clock, the  Magistrates, attended by their<br>officers, appeared in the hall of the Lock-up, when Donaldson was<br>ushered in, and a psalm being sung, and a fervent and impressive<br>prayer offered up on his behalf, he underwent the usual operation of pinioning his arms.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The melancholy procession then moved up<br>Libberton's Wynd,  to the scaffold erected in the Lawn-Market<br>Here a most pathetic prayer was again offered up, in which the un-<br>fortunate man appeared most seriously and attentively to join; and,<br>after shaking hands with those around him, he was then assisted to<br>ascend the fatal drop.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The executioner proceeded to adjust the<br>aparatus of death, while the unfortunate man appeared to pray very<br>earnestly.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In a few minutes he let go the fatal signal, when the<br>drop fell, and the world closed upon him for ever.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He struggled a<br>good deal, and appeared much convulsed.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After hanging about<br>six-and-thirty minutes, the body was lowered down, and afterwards<br>conveyed to the Calton Jail, there to be interred, in pursuance of<br>the sentence.<p><p>Sanderson, Printer, High Street, Edinburgh. <p></p>
