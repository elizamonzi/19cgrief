	<h2>Transcription</h2>
	<p> A full and particular account or a remarkable and fearful noise and disturbance;<br>that has continued for above three weeks at a Farmer's house at Sourhole, in<br>the parish of Collington, a few miles south west of Edinburgh.<p>WE have hitherto avoided publishing<br> any thing concerning that extrao-<br>dinary noise which has been heard for<br>some time past in a farmer's house in<br>the parish of Collington, as we for some<br>time doubted the truth of such reports;<br>but as every endeavour has been used<br>to find out the cause without effect, such<br> as lifting the floor and examining every<br>part of the house, we must give credit<br>to the reports which so many have a-<br>vouched for a truth ; whether it is na-<br>tural or supernatural we cannot say, but<br>it has every appearance to be of the lat-<br>ter kind. The following account ap-<br>pears to be nearest to truth of its begin-<br>ning and operations.<p>About the third or fourth of this<br>month, the most remarkable Phenome-<br>non began to manitest itself about the<br>house of a decent farmer at Sourhole,<br>about three miles and a half from Edin-<br>burgh. It comes in various forms,<br>sometimes as it were a, chap or knock-<br>ing at the door, and so increases to a<br>a very tremenduous and frightful noise<br>round about the whole house, and so<br>loud, that it is often heard for above a<br>quarter of a mile distant. Several peo-<br>ple of respectability have examined all<br>parts about the house, and are convinced<br>there is no possibility of any imposition.<br>The people of the house, who are se-<br>rious Christians, left it, leaving some of<br>their friends in the mean time to stay<br>in it, to see whether it was them or the<br>house that was thus disturbed, but the<br>noise (though some says not) continued<br>the same. Some times it comes like a<br>gust of wind about the door, and then<br>the noise commences very frightful to<br>hear. Several people have stood round<br>about the whole house, at small distan-<br>ces from another, and some times have<br>fired guns, to try if it would make any<br>difference, but the noise continued the<br>same ; and what is very well worth ob-<p>servation,a man who pretended to great<br>courage, said, if they would give him<br>plenty of whiskey, he would fight the<br>dumb Devil; but, when the noise be-<br>gan, he was forced to be led out of the<br>house by two men. Another who seem-<br>ed still more daring and bold, said, he<br>would stay in the house alone ; but no<br>sooner did the noise begin, then he<br>fainted quite away, and when carried,<br>out of the house, was a good while ere<br>he recovered. Some persons of credit,<br>who were lately at the house, enquired<br>of the family, as if they had been way-<br>faring people, if there was any truth of<br>what was reported concerning his bro-<br>ther, when the man solemnly declared<br>the report was utterly void of founda-<br>tion. He said, moreover, that as they<br>lived on a high road, he had caused his<br>son to search the draw-well and every<br>drain near the place left any person had<br>been murdered there, but no such thing<br>could be found. Some Clergymen have<br>also taken the trouble, in company with<br>several gentlemen, to endeavour to find<br>out the reason of the unaccountable<br>noise, but as yet without success And<br>what is very observable, the noise is<br>some times more frequent than others,<br>and some times in the night, some times<br>in the day, and those at work at the a-<br>foresaid distance of above a quarter of a<br>mile, will hear the noise, as if a great<br>many anchor smiths fore hammers were<br>at work. The noise has been more fre-<br>quent and awful for these two or three<br>days past, particularly yesterday the 26,<br>the noise was most tremenduous and<br>dreadful to hear.<p>This short and true statement of this<br>wonderful and unaccountable Pheno-<br>menon is given to prevent people from<br>being misled with the many fictions and<br>groundless reports that are now spread<br>through the country without the least<br>foundation.
