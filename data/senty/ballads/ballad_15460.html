	<p> Lamentation<p>OF<p>Elizabeth Banks<p>Presently lying under Sentence of Death in the Calton-Hill Jail, and who is<br>to be Executed at Edinburgh on Monday the 3d day of August next, for<br>the Horrid and Barbarous Murder of PETER BANKS, her husband, at<br>Pathtead, by giving him a quantity of Arsenic in a doze of Epsom Salts<br>on the 28th of April past, of which he died the same day in great agony.<p>ELIZABETH  M'NIEL or NIEL or BANKS or BAULKS was ar-<br>raigned at the bar  of the High Court of Justiciary, on Monday the<br>18th day of July 1835, on a charge of wilfully, wickedly, and feloniously<br>mizing a quantity of arsenic in a doze of Epsom salts, which she adminis-<br>tered to Peter Banks or Baulks, her husband, on the 28th of April last, in<br>Consequence of whith he was  immediately taken violently ill, and died on or<br>about the same day.<p>The purchasing of poison by the prisoner, under the pretence of killing<br>rats, was proved by Mr Otto surgeon, Pathhead, by Mrs Otto, and their<br>daughter Sarah; and  the mixing of a whitish powder along with the salte<br>was deponed to by a son of the deceased by a former wife, and his severe-<br>poin and vomiting, and consequent death.-- Ann M'Gregor. the house-keeper<br>at Chesterhall, gave the prisoner a shilling as charity, and the Ottos depos-<br>od to the prisoner tendering a shilling in payment of the arsenic, she reciv-<br>tenpence in change.?Jean Scougalll, a very old woman and next door neigh-<br>bour, deponed to the state in which she saw the deceased, whose illness the<br>'prisoner said was cholera, but that he would not hear of  doctor.-?The<br>prisoner had a discoloured eye at the time, for which she accounted in vari-<br>ous ways : but she had been heard to say that her husband had struck her,<br>and that he would repent it.?Mr Alexander Watson, surgeon, opened the<br>body of the deceased, in presence of Mr J. P. Rae, upon which there was no<br>external marks of injury, but in the stomach there was a considerable quan-<br>tity of arsenic?much more than sufficient to cause death.?Mr Rae and<br>Professor Traill had no doubt that the deceased had died from arsenic.<p>The panne! was then sentenced to be executed on Monday the 3d day of<br>August next, at the usual place of execution in the Lawn-Market, or at<br>such other place as may be fixed upon by the Magistrates of the City.<p>The unfortunate culprit, who is of a meagre like appearance, and of about<br>fifty years of age, heard her awful doom pronounced with little visible dis-<br>composure,?Since her condemnation she has attempted to starve herself;<br> she resolutely refused all food until the Friday, when she at length yielded<br>to the cravings of hunger,?and recommenced the course on Saturday, but<br>has since again given in.<p>Dear friend, hear my sad moaning,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>In prison I lie groaning,<br>By death to make atoning<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For murder of my spouse.<p>Take pity, now, I pray, friends.<br>For short, short is my stay, friends ;<br>I'll soon be in the clay, friends,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Beneath this prison house.<p>O when I married first, friends,<br>I  thought that I Was blest, friends,<br>But here I lie half curst, friends,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In chains, alas! I'mbound.<p>Sore, sore, I now repent, friends,<br>For foer  to h?l I'm sent, friends;<br>My heart is like to rent, friends,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I dream of devils  sound.<p>O, Wives, take an example.<br>Of bad wives I'm a sample;<br>When hang'd they'll on the trample.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In prison under ground.<p>" The hour it fast approaches,"<br>I dread the sound of coaches?<br>O pity such poor wretches,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like me few can be found.<p>My Peter he had no fault?&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; '<br>That day I drank too much malt.<br>Which made me mix the death salt.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For which I'll soon be hang'd.<p><br>O pray, friends, for a mortal,<br>To you it can't be hurtful;<br>My crime it was most dreadful-<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pray that I'll not be d--d. <p>Sanderson, Printer, High Street, Edinburgh.</p>
