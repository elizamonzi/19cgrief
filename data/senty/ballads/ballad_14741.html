	<p> THE CONDEMNED;<p>OR,<p>THE LAST MOMENTS OF WILLIAM PERRIE<p>Executed at Paisley, October 18th, 1837.<p>" He died, as erring man should die,<br>Without display, without parade."<p>The morning came, the hours flew pas.-<br>Yea, the fatal hour, poor Perrie's last,<br>Drew near, on which he was to die,<br>And meet his God, his Judge on high.<p>Far as the eye could reach, front of the massy jail,<br>The eager crowds throng round the fatal pale :<br>A solemn stillness now pervades the air,<br>And awes the multitudes assembled there ;<br>And from each choked up window, house-top high,<br>Heads peer above each other to the sky,<br>All anxious each, (while silence rules each breath)<br>To view the blackened instrument of death,<br>Around whose site, due order to command,<br>The assembled batonmen of office stand.<p>He comes, the murderer he comes?palid, wan,<br>The downcast countenance of the fated man.<br>Slowly he comes, poor guilty creature of the sod,<br>Attended by the pious messengers of God,<br>The heralds of his mercy; and as they near<br>The place of death, soft to his willing ear,<br>And soothing to his spirit, the promises of Heaven,<br>The pleasing hope that he would be forgiven.<p>The period arrives, the precious moments roll?<br>A hoping cheerlessness pervades his soul;<br>Wav'ring 'twixt fear and hope, he knows not why,<br>And feels reluctant that he is to die<br>A death of ignominy and of shame,<br>And terror scizes on him at the name,<br>Shrinks his enfeebled, enervated frame.<p>Now stands he on the platform?not a sound<br>Escapes the bosoms of the crowd around;<br>The gaunt minister of death stoops down to loose<br>The neckloth folds, adjusts the fatal noose<br>In that stern, pityless, apathy of mind<br>Which characterise the beings of his kind;<p>Last draws the horrid cap, the emblem of disgrace,<br>Hides from the view the malefactor's face,<br>And shades it from the world?ah !  who could scan<br>The emotions of that breast, that soul, that man,<br>At the sad crisis of his fate, to feel and know<br>That his last hour was come, for weal or woe.<p>Hark! through the silence still that reigns in air,<br>A voice is heard, engaged in solemn prayer;<br>That lonely voice ascends to God on high,<br>Pours forth his soul for him about to die,<br>In thrilling accents, audibly convey'd<br>From ear to ear, his feeling heart betray'd;<br>Twas he, Macnaughtan, blessings on his head,<br>That strove thus to console, ere spirit fled.<p>He ceas'd, the heavy task was o'er,<br>His soul was full, he said no more,<br>And shaking hands, heart-rending to the view,<br>The minister of life bade him a last adieu.<p>Now stood the criminal, unaided and alone,<br>You hear his tremulous voice, as it ascends the throne<br>Of God, imploring mercy, through his Saviour Son.<br>There now the signal drops ! ah ! no, not yet;<br>His heart, perhaps, on earthly things is set.<br>His voice again strikes on the startled ear,<br>And harrowed up he seems, 'twixt hope and fear,<br>Implores his God, his Saviour, his Friend,<br>To grant support on this his awful end.<br>The man of death his victim calm surveys,<br>And heeds alike his pangs, the multitudes amaze.<p>Imploring still he seems, his hands he clasps,<br>And rigid to his breast his napkin graps?<br>He flings it from him?oh dreadful could it be?<br>His struggling soul was in eternity.</p>
