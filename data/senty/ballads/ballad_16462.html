	<p> HUZZA FOR REFORM<p>AND  THE<p>Garland of Green !<p>A NEW SONG.<p>TUNE?Sprig of Shillelah.<p>Let them boast of the Shamrock, the Thistle, and Rose,<br>I sing of what's fairer then any of those?<br>Of the cause of Reform and the Garland of Green :<p>For green is the colour that gladdens the sight,<br>'Tis the Livery of Nature?'tis Aytoun's delight,<br>And long may that colour triumphant adorn,<br>The HERO by whom 'tis so worthily worn,<br>Then Huzza for Reform and the Garland the Green !<p><p>The Whigs they may swagger in Yellow and Blue,<br>But we'll give them a mouthful that's hard for to chew.<br>If they touch but a leaf of our Garland of Green.<p>And before they have done with that morsel so tough,<br>their hopes will be withered and yellow enough,<br>While by each true Reformer forever forsook,<br>I hardly need tell you how blue they  will look,<br>While fieshly shall flourish the Garland of Green.<p><p>No wonder at Aytoun they spitefully rail,<br>Seeing how he's man on a popular Scale,<br>A friend of Reform and the Garland of Green.<p>They know he's determined their tricks to expose,<br>As all his past conduct sufficiently shows ;<br>And that in the great contest he never will yield,<br>But will kick each Whig-Pensioner out of the field,<br>In the cause of Reform and the Garland of Green.<p>Aberomnbie, the place-man,?deny it who dare?<br>The brand of corruption forever must wear,<br>While Aytoun shall triumph in Garland of Green.<p>He may talk very  big of Reform to be sure,<br>But will any true Scotchman one moment endure,<br>While he wrings from the poor his two thousand a-year,<br>That his beggarly face should be ever seen here,<br>Where Reformers are crown'd with the garland of green<p>Then there's Jeffrey who's lately deserted the cause,<br>And by what he now calls "his unfortunate clause,"<br>Has insulted each Wend of the Garland of Green.<p>His friends may attempt the offence to explain,<br>But every attempt only fixes the stain;<br>So that now he has brought himself almost as low<br>As when laid on his back by the hard-hitting FOE<br>Of the cause of Reform and the Garland of Green.<p>Ye gallant Reformers, our Brethern of Leith,<br>Tell Bottom to chuse some appropriate wreath,<br>More fitting for him then the Garland of Green!<p><p>And if Bottom object to this good humoured wipe,<br>He knows the old proverb?"Put that in your PIPE"?<br>For a joke's but a joke, and to me it is clear,<br>We've our right to a laugh for six hundred a-year?<br>Let them laugh if they can at the Garland of Green.<p>But laughing and joking at present apart,<br>Let all true Reformers unite hand and heart<br>In the glorious cause of the Garland of Green.<p>Let every true Briton re-echo the song,<br>And the true sons of Erin be first in the throng ;<br>And then let Whig-Pensioners talk as they may,<br>Our own gallant AYTOUN shall carry the day,<br>So Huzza for Reform and the Garland of Green !</p>
