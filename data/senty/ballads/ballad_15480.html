	<p> Confession<p>OF<p>MURDER!<p>A Full and Particular Account of the Apprehension of<br>THOMAS MOFFAT, who fled from Kilsyth about<br>three years ago, for the Barbarous Murder of his<br>own Father, by repeated Stabs in the abdomen!<br>with an Account of his Confession and also of the<br>manner in which he spent his life since, &c.<p>ON Friday the 7th of October 1825, Serjeant Leckie of the Cal-<br>ton Police Glasgow, accampanied by a Sheriff-Officer, appre-<br>hended, in Auchinearn, who was working at his loom in a house<br>in that village, where he went under the assumed name of George<br>Watson. It will be recollected he was outlawed for the murder of<br>his father, three years ago, in Kilsyth. He was seized without his<br>coat; and was taken into a public-house,, he made off, and ran<br>through three parks, bolting through hedges, but was at last taken<br>in ambush.<p>He says he was twice in the police office since the murder, but<br>was not reconized. He confesses the murder; but blames his fa-<br>ther for striking and ill-using his mother, and for drinking all the<br>money he earned, and starving the family, and giving them no<br>education whatever. He said that the night he killed his father,<br>he was much intoxicated, and did not recollect how the murder<br>was effected. The death of his father was effected by repeated stabs<br>in the adbomen.<p>He said when he absconded he went to Dumfries, but stopped<br>only ooe or tow nights there, because ne could not rest. He came<br>to Auchinearn, where he had been living ever since. He said he<br>has never since got a sound sleep, except the nights he was the<br>worse of liquor. He was about to be married.<p>When in jail, he said to Mr Leckie that it was the happiest night<br>he had since he committed the deed. If his mother was dead, he<br>he did not care how soon he left the world. He has a very down-<br>cast look, and is about 5 feet 8 inches high. He was sent off on<br>Tuesday morning under an escort to Stirling Jail.<p>Edinburgh :?Printed for James M'Lean.?Price One Penny.</p>
