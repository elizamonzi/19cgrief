May 1830 for the mur-<br>der of their father.<p>At the Exeter Assizes held last week, William and Alexander Thomson, two<br>brothers were indicted for the most attrocious murder of their father, James Thom-<br>son by entering his bed room in the night, and cruelly cutting his throat, they be<br>ing advised to commit this horrid transaction by two infamous woman, for the pur-<br>pose of obtaining his money. They intended to rob the house after committing<br>this attrocity, and being disappointed, the two females were the first informers on <br>the murderers. These unfortunate young men were immediately appre-.<br>hended and committed to the- J il of Exeter, in order to abide their trial.<br>When they appea'ed at the bar. they both pleaded not guilty. The youn-<br>ger brother on observing his paramour as an evidence against him he<br>looked at her for some time with a steady countenance but afterwards<br>shewed some symptoms of despair.<p>The witnesses having been examined at length the Jury retired for a few min-<br>utes, and returned a verdict finding both prisoners gnilty of the murder or their<br>father. ...The Learned Judge than proceeded to pass the last sentence of the law<br>He addressed them both in the most solemn manner on the enormity of their<br>crime, and hoped they would sincerely repent, and prepare themselves for an e?<br>nother world, He then ordered that, they should be both executed at the comman<br>place of Execution in the City of Exeter, on Friday First and their hodies given<br>for desection.<p>At half-past 2 o'clock on Friday&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;unfortunate&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;men ascended the platform<br>accompanied by the. under Sherriff, Chaplain and other assistants. They both<br>spoke to the surrounding multitude for some  time beseeching them to take a sol-<br>emn warning by their fate, to keep holy the sabbath day, and to refrain from<br>the company of bad women and drunkenness. The oldest brother bowed himself<br>to the spectators. and bade them  all a finale farewel . He thanked the Rev.<br>Gentlemen most kindly for their attendance and after spending a few minutes in<br>prayer, the signal was given and they were launched into eteruity. After haug-<br>ing the usual time, their bodies were cut down and delivered to the surgeons<br>for dissection.<p>During their imprisonment they behaved with propriety, and paid every atten-<br>tion to their religious duties They addressed a few lines to an uncle, asking<br>forg veness and making the most sincere repentance. They expected no miliga-<br>gation of punishment, and often wished that the fatal hour was come that they<br>would end their misery. Tney died in peace with all mankind, but regretted the<br>shame and disgrace they had brought upon the country.<p>Copy of a letter from one of&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;these young men,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the Day<p>before his execution, to his sweatheart?Condemned Cell<p>8 o'clock, Dear&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Margaret&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;before&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;leaving this world,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I<p>write you these lines, letting you  know that I sincerely re<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;pent all my past crimes,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I never tnought  that  you who<p>I&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;was the cause of me being led astray would have been an<p>evidence at my trial.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  I  freely&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;forgive&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;you,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but I hope<p>that all other young men will gaurd against all such vices!<p>and not be enamoured by the deceit and treachery of such<p>  female traitors.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A.
