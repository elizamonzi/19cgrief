	<p> RUMOUR<p>OF<p>Burking in Leith.<p>A Full, True, and Interesting Account of<br>the Serious Rumours at present afloat of<br>Two Fish-Women being missed in Leith<br>within a few days past, and of their bodies<br>having been found hidden in a barrel,?<br>as also of the apprehension of the suspect-<br>ed individual.<p>A subject which, if true, is in some de-<br>gree paralell to the atrocious deeds of the<br>notorious Burke and Hare, at present forms<br>the all-engrossing subject of conversation a-<br>mong all classes of society in the town of<br>Leith and its neigbhourhood.<p>The transaction having but lately occurred,<br>and it being impossible for us during the in-<br>vestigation of such cases, (even judging from<br>its features so currently reported), to give<br>any thing like a correct statement thereof,<br>we trust we shall not be liable to any serious<br>imputation of incorroctness in communicat-<br>ing to the public, the following detached,<br>and in many respects contradictory acounts<br>so current among the inhabitants of the<br>town where transaction is said to have taken<br>place.<p>It appears that two poor women who were<br>in  the constant habit of earning their sub-<br>sistence&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;by  the&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;laborious&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;industrious<br>occupation of gathering shell-fish,  and dis-<br>posing of them to the inhabitants of the sur-<br>rounding country, were understood to have<br>been up very early one morning in the latter<br>end of last week, to  go to the Black Rocks,<br>for the purpose of pursuing their nsual avo-<br>cations, and not  returning  again, iheir  ab-<br>sence created a general surmise among their<br>acquaintances as to their fate.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the course<br>of their conjectures, it is said it  was assert-<br>ed, that the place they were last seen at that<br>morning, was at or near to a Mr A----n's re-<br>siding near the  shore.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In  consequence of<br>this, it is said, that he was strongly suspect-<br>ed of some unfair conduct towards the missed<br>individuals, and a great mob assembled near<br>his house, threatening him with  instant de-<br>struction,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;when the police  interfered,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and<br>conveyed him to the office, where, it is said,<br>he still remains, as some say, for protection,<br>others for investigation.<p>Other accounts say, that the bodies were<br>discovered from the smell, hidden in a large<br>barrel or hogshead.<p>It is also rumoured, that the individual<br>implicated in this transaction, had been for-<br>merly known, or suspected to have had a<br>hand in something of the same nature be-<br>fore.<p>For the truth of any of the above reports,<br>we cannot attempt to vouch, but such are<br>the rumours in general afloat among the<br>people ;?though it appears to us most likely<br>the upshot of the affair will turn out to be,<br>that the unfortunate individuals were sur-<br>rounded by the sea, and perished in a wa-<br>tery grave.<p>Edinburgh, Printed for George Craig,<br>Price One Penny.</p>
