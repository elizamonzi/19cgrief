	<p> JACKIE TAR.<p>PRICE ONE PENNY.<p>Read now, and rejoice, for the Poet here lays before you rol-<br>licking and leal hearted " Jackie Tar," All can now be supplied<br>with copies of this fine song, by applying to the Poet, at the Poets<br>Box, 6 St. Andrew's  Lane, Glasgow and, while there, the Poet,<br>will show you his extensive collection unequalled for extent and<br>variety.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Remember the Address,  6 St. Andrew's Lane, Glasgow.<p>Air?I'd rather have a guinea than a one pound note,<p>When Jack had pulled the oar, and the boat was gone,<br>Aud the lassie on the shore with her head hanging down,  <br>The tears stood in her eyes, and bosom heaving sighs,<br>Farewell, my dear, she dries, with your trousers on.<p>Farewell, said he, I go to sea, and you must stay behind,<br>But do not grieve, for while I live I ever will be kind,<br>And when I come to land you will meet me on the strand,<br>And welcome Jackie Tar With his trousers on.<p>Now peace is proclaimed, and the wars are all o'er, <br>The fleets they are moored, and  the sailors come ashore,<br>Now you may see her stand with a glass into her hand,<br>To welcome jack to land with his trousers on.<p>While up on high, she catched his, with all her lovely charms,<br>Her face he knew, and straight he flew and caught her in<br>his arms;<br>Her hand he kindly pressed, as he held her round the waist<br>And he kissed the bonnie lassie with his trousers on.<p>O  Jack where have you been since you went from me,<br>And want have you seen upon the raging sea?<br>I  mourned for your sake, while my heart was like to break,<br>For I thought l'd never see my Jack with his trousers on.<p>And while you staid, I  sighed and prayed to Neptune and<br>to Mars,<br>That they would prove kind, and send you home save from<br>the wars, <br>And now to my request they have been pleased to list,<br>And sent you to my breast with your trousers on.<p>I have sailed the seas for you to the Torrid Zone,<br>From the confines of Peru to Van Dieman's Land,<br>From the Bay of Baltimore to the coast of Lobradore,<br>But now I'm safe on shore with my trousers on.<p>I have beat the storms, in many torms, upon the raging main.<br>I have fought the foes, with deadly blows, and many a hero<br>slain;<br>I have heard the cannons roar, I have rolled in blood and gore<br>But now I'm safe on shore, with my trousers on.<p>I have been aloft when the winds have blown,<br>And I have been alost when the bombs were thrown,<br>But like a sailor bold, I am now come from the hole,<br>With my pockets full of gold, and my trousers on.<p>And now no more, from shore to shore, I'll plough the rag-<br>ing seas,<br>But free from strife, as a man and wife, we'll live in peace <br>and ease.<br>To the church this couple hied, and the priest the knot has<br>tied,<br>And the sailor kissed his bride with his trousers on,<p>The Poet's Blacking is universally acknowledged<br>to be the best now sold in the world.  It can only<br>be had in the Poet's Box, 6 St Andrew's Lane, off<br>Gallowgate, Glasgow.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<p>Junuary 6, 1855.</p>
