	<h2>Transcription</h2>
	<p> The Genuine last Speeches and dying words of  THOMAS SMITH and GEORGE STEPHENSON. <br>Who were Executed at the West End of the Tolbooth of Edinburgh, on Wednesday the 21st of January, 1807, for the Crime of<br>Horse Stealing; contained in Two Letters from them to their Wives, writtten by their own hands. <p>Letter from Thomas Smith to his Wife.<br>Dear and loving Wife, Edinburgh, Jan. 1st, 1807.<p>THESE are my last dying words and wishes to you, which<br>I hope you will attend to, and doing so, you will find<br>for your good after I am gone from this world. I hope and<br>trust in God, however, that I shall be for ever happy in ever-<br>lasting glory, through the blood of our dear Saviour, sweet<br>Jesus Christ, who died for poor sinners ; where also I hope<br>and trust to meet you and my dear Babes; and to 'have you<br>delivered into my arms by our Lord, -I have asked the Mi-<br>nister, whether, if we both went to glory and happiness, (I<br>mean you, my dear Wife, whom I love as dearly as my own<br>precious life,) we should know each other in that glorious<br>place or not ? He says there is no doubt but we shall, or else<br>how came the rich man to know the beggar who was in<br>Abraham's bosom ? So dear loving Wife, let you marry who<br>you will for your next husband, I hope and trust, let your<br>days and years be ever so long, or ever so short, that you will<br>pray to God, and that your prayers may be, that he will de-<br>liver you to me in everlasting happiness and glory, where I<br>hope and trust in God, you and I shall meet. This is my<br>prayer night and day, my dear sweet Wife , and I hope it<br>will be your's.<p>Had the Cord been pleased to have restored me again to<br>you, my dear Wife we should have been the happiest couple<br>that ever lived in the world ; and still I hope you will be<br>happy in this troublesome world, if you take my advice and<br>I make no doubt but you will do so, as you are sure in your<br>own mind that I should be very sorry to advise you to do any<br> thing for your hurt. So pray do not forget what I now say<br>to you.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<p>Dear Wife, Do not merely read this and throw it in the<br>fire, but save it and read it at different time, for this is my<br>desire, and I hope you will attend to it. Dear Wife, It is<br>my desire from my heart, that you will not part with my<br>Watch nor any of the seals, but keep them for my sake, till<br>my own son, William Humerston Smith, is old enough to<br>take care of it; and I hope and trust, you will give it to him ;<br>and tell him, it was his own dear Father's watch, and that it<br>was my desire he should have it ; and that he should keep it<br>for my sake -Dear Wife, Let you marry who you will, pray<br>make this agreement with them, that they are never to wear<br>that watch, but that you are to keep it yourself, till my son<br>can take care of it. If you make this agreement before you<br>marry; it will occasion no difference between you afterwards.<p>Dear Wife. I think your best way to act after my death,<br>will be to go home, and sell off all you have, but your bed<br>and bed clothes, and take these by the waggon, or by water,<br>which ever you may think best, and go to the town where<br>-------------------- lives,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;where every one will  caress<br>you, and lament for you, and be glad to see you ; and they<br>will help you into some way of doing that will be better for<br>you than staying at----------banks, to spend all you have, or<br>to marry a poor Pitman, or any other drunken men ; for that<br>would be still but ending your days in far worse unhappiness<br>than any thing you could do besides. You are worthy of<br>yourself of a gentleman, or a good tradesman, who can main-<br>tain you as you ought to be. Never let it come into your<br>mind, that any person of good sense will despise you, or think<br>you unworthy of being a Wife, if you behave yourself, as I<br>hope, you will do. Now my dear Wife, believe this to be a<br>truth, and that it is for your good both in this world and with<br>a view to the next, that you let no man living overcome you<br>by promises, nor by oaths, or ever such fair speeches. For<br>depend upon it, a man that makes such oaths and promises,<br>he only wants to satisfy his own lust; and any man that wish-<br>es to make a woman his whore I am sure he has no regard<br>for her.<p>And now I pray God  to bless you and to direct you in your duty;<br>for I shall not be able to give you many more advice. Pray take my<br>advice ; And for God's sake take care what you do. Believe me, my<br>dear, and speakimg in my last moments in the presence of him who<br>knows my heart, that I love you beyond expression. God have mercy<br>on you and my dear babes. Had I been but restored to you again, I<br>never should have thought I could have done enough for you to have<br>made you sufficiently happy.<p>"Give my love to WILL and his wife, at J-----------------, I mean<br>if you ever see them. As long as I have life and sense in me, I will<br>pray to God that we may meet again at the last day of judgment. I<br>hope to be in glory when my breath departs. God bless you. and may<br>he be with you forever and ever. Amen.<p>My last request is, that you see me buried before you leave me.<br>From your own dear husband's dying hand, THOMAS SMITH.<p><br>Letter from George Stephenson to his Wife.<br>My Dear Wife  Edinburgh, January, 2d 1807.<p>MY God has granted me grace to write these few lines<br>to you ; and I hope you and my Dear Little Child<br>are well.-My dear Wife, I hope you will forgive me for<br>the ill using of you, as I have my dear Wife. I send you these<br>few lines to let you know, that I am dead ; And I hope you<br>will always take care of my Dear Little Angel.<p>My dear Wife,-My distress calls me to think of parting<br>with you.-The will of the Lord be done.-I thank you for<br>your tender care of me : may the Lord bless and reward you<br>for it, and sanctify your own tenderness, and support you un-<br>der it, As you have studied to live a life of faith and prayer<br>all your days, so I hope and believe you will continue to the<br>end. In all your difficulties and fears. O encourage yourself<br>in the Lord your God ; commit your ways to him ; trust him<br>that is faithful and true.-I resign you, my dear, to the Hus-<br>band of Husbands, our dearest Lord Jesus Christ.- My<br>Children,. Your earthly father must leave you ; but he leaves<br>you to the care of your Heavenly Father, who is immortal.<br>O cleave fast to him ! Trifle not about your souls concerns in<br>time of health ! Mind these things as the one thing needful<br>This you will not repent of, when you come within a near<br>view of death, and endless eternity, O press for clear views<br>of your interest in Christ, the only surety and Saviour of sin-<br>ners. Among other evidences of it, live by faith on him,<br>and study holiness in heart and life.<p>Dear children,-Think how you will be able to stand before<br>Christ, your Judge, at the Last Day, unless you have Christ's<br>image on you, and be made new creatures. Lord make you<br>all such, and bless you with his best blessing -My blessing be<br>upon you all.-What means God gave me, I have beslowed on<br>you, or lest them to you. Be kind and careful of your .Mo.<br>ther, while you have her; and let none of you forget, that<br>though I go before you to the dust, you must all quickly follow<br>me. O that we may all meet together, at the right hand of<br>our blessed Redeemer, to see his face, and praise him forever.<br>The time is near; be ye therefore also ready.<p>Now, my dear Witsand Children,? Remember what it a-<br>bove, as the words of your affectionate Hasband and Loving<br>Father,'who, being dead, yot herebyspeaketh td.you for your<br>eternal good and happiness. May they sink deep into your<br>hearts ; so prayeth your loving Husband.<p>My dear Wife,?I have been long afflicted since I left you;<br>and 1 hope the Lord has taken me to everlasting rest and hap-<br>piness ?And I hope the Lord will bless and protecl you all,<br>and forever be your guide.<p>So no more from your loving Husband.<br>This is my own hand-writing before my death.<p>GEORGE STEPHENSON.<p>Thomas Smith, aged 39 years, has left a wiseand five child-<br>ren, three by a former marriage, and two by his wife to whom<br>the above letter is addresied. Besides the above he has wrote<br>several letters to his children and other friends. They all con-<br>tain earnest expostulations with them to do their utmost take<br>to his widow, and to behave themselves properly, and to take<br>warning by his unsortunate situition, has also untimely end.<p>George Stephenson, aged 32 yea»s, has also left a wife and<br>children. His wife knew nothing of his being in prison, nor<br>would she hear of his situation till some days after his death, ar<br>she lived' in the neighbourhood of London : and no word was<br>to be sent her till after his death.<p>They behaved with great propriety on the scaffold. After the<br>clergymen who attended them in prison had left them to their own<br>meditations, they engaged in prayer with vast servour and devotion,<br>after the manner of the Church of England. They continued some<br>minutes previous to their going on the drop in vast agitation.<br>When they went on the drop, and had the satal rope about their<br>neck, they still continued making use of the prayer-book, till the<br>Executioner gave them intimation that their time was gone; the<br>prayer-book was immediately dropped, and they launched into<br>eternity ; where from every appearance or evidence that could be<br>given, they are now happy.<p>The crime for which they were condemned they fully acknow-<br>ledged.<p>Agreeable to the practice of the Church of England, the religi-<br>ous cermony of that church was gone about over the corps previ-<br>ous to their being buried.<br>At their own desire, lime was put into their coffins, to prevent<br>their being of use for dissection.<p>Augus, Printer.<p><br></p>
