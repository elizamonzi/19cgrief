	<p> Mackay Poisoned!!<p>It is now firmly believed that Sandy was hocussed, as they term<br>it in the fancy, and the wretch who administered the soporific drug<br>is unhesitatingly named through all the sporting houses.<p>There are two stones told regarding how the diabolical deed was<br>accomplished. One says, that it was given to Sandy a little before<br>he entered the ring ; and another says, that during one or other of<br>the wrangles about the foul play, that the incendiary took an op-<br>portunity to change the water-bottle used by Mackay's seconds, and<br>to substitute one containg poison, It is likewise said that Tom<br>Crib had partaken partially of the sleeping draught ?Glasgow Free<br>Press.............It is stated, that on Friday last, Mackay's body was<br>raised and inspected by two surgeons, when two ounces of lauda-<br>num was found in his stomach, which prove that he had been wil-<br>fully poisoned by some person or other.<p>STAFFORD, 7th June 1830.....This day, Barney M'Guire of<br>whom mention is repeatedly made, in the life of the cele-<br>brated David Haggart, who was executed in Edinburgh, in Scot-<br>land, a few years ago, for the murder of the Dumfries Jailor there,<br>underwent the last sentence of the law here, for murder and rob-<br>bery. M'Guire may be well remembered by the public, to have been<br>transported for a limited term of years, for highway robbery in a<br>public fair at Appleby, which period was not expired ; but, at the<br>loss of the Hulk Dolphin, on board of which he was confined as a<br>convict, in the river Medwey in November last, he made his escape,<br>and afterwards arrived in London, where he commenced operations<br>in his old line. He entered into several shops, on pretence of pur-<br>chasing some articles of clothing, trinkets, jewellery, &c., and al-<br>ways contrived to secrete about his person, and carry off, various<br>articles of goods, money, &c., when he came away. Barney watched<br>his opportunity, on one occasion, and entered the shop of a wealthy<br>Jew in Rosemary Lane, where lay, in a window, a great variety of<br>gold coin of various countries and reigns, as also several silver<br>articles, all of which Barney contrived to carry off at his departure.<br>He declared this to be the masterpiece of his performances since<br>his escape from the Dolphin.<p>He left London early the next morning for Newcastle, under the<br>ficticious name of James Williamson, where he met with several of<br>his old companions, who were heartily glad to see him once more<br>at liberty, and from whom he met with a very warm and affection-<br>ate reception. He immediately commenced operations, and boldly<br>took to the highway, the very next day after his arrival at New-<br>castle. He robbed one gentleman of his pocket book, containing<br>upwards of £60, and several bills, and took a purse from another,<br>the same day, containing ten or twelve sovereigns, and some silver,<br>declaring he had nothing in his hands at the time but a snuff box,<br>shaped somewhat like a pistol. He then returned to his haunt in<br>Newcastle, where he divided his spoil with his merry companions,<br>and ate and drank with them while it lasted. He next robbed a<br>gentleman of a gold watch, chain and seals, is Sandgate, in open<br>day, of which he soon disposed. After this he went to Kendal,<br>where he purchased a brace of pistols, and a prad, (horse) being<br>determined to be prepared for a glorious campaign. While he re-<br>mained in Kendal, he broke into the shop of Messrs G. Watson<br>and Son, clothiers and general merchants ; but, being taken in the<br>act, he turned round and shot Mr Watson, who he killed on the<br>spot. He was pursued by the son, and was taken near Stafford,<br>where he was committed to prison to await his trial at the Assizes.<br>Being tried at the last assizes for this county, he was convicted of<br>the murder of Mr Watson, and was sentenced to he executed on<br>the first market day, and Ms body to be given for dissection, Since<br>his condemnation, he made the above confessions and declarations<br>to the reverend ordinary of our jail.<p>Accordingly, on this fatal day, this celebrated ill-fated man was<br>brought out to the scaffold, about eight o'clock in the morning.<br>He stept to the front of the platform, and addressed the multitude<br>very fervently for several minutes; exhorting them to refrain from<br>drinking?from the company of lewd and bad women?and from<br>profane swearing. He said he richly deserved death for the many<br>crimes he had committed; and, indeed, says he, ' I have been even<br>teacher and a father to wickedness and wicked men;' alluding to<br>the connection subsisting between him and that extraordinary<br>character, the late well known and celebrated David Haggart, as<br>well as to two other companions he had. After which he mounted<br>the fatal drop firmly, where he spent a few minutes in fervent<br>prayer, and then dropt the signal and was instantly launched into<br>eternity, amidst a vast concourse of spectators.<p>Printed for William Rebertson...Price One Penny.<p></p>
