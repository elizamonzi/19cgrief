	<p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; TRIAL<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  AND<p>SENTENCE<p>Just published, the Trial of Duncan Macmillan, for the<br>horrid crime of assaulting and raviging the person of<br>Jean M'Lauchlane, with the dreadful Sentence pro-<br>nounced upon him, which important trial came on<br>before the High Court of Justiciary yesterday, and<br>lasted for twelve hours.<p>The Lord Justice Clerk and Lords Commisioners of<br>Justiciary met this morning to sit on the trial of Dun-<br>can M'Millan, a young man, from Fort William, The<br>indictment charged the pannel with having violated the<br>person of Jean M'Lauchlane, a good looking country<br>girl, about 17 years of age.<p>The trial proceeded with shut doors, but we are able,<br>to give the following brief account of this indelicate<br>crime for which the prisoner stood charged.<p>It appeared that the pannel had met the  girl in the<br>town of Fort William, She consented to go into a<br>public house with him,  where the prisoner called  for a<br>bottle of porter, at the same time requesting the land-<br>lord to delute the liquor with half tumbler of whisky, which was<br>done and presented  to, the unsuspecting girl, who drank freely of<br>it. They shortly after left the  house,  and an reaching a  ford a few<br>miles  in the country, the  girl been me  disny, when the  prisoner  took<br>her on his back and crossed the water,  and committed the  assault<br>for which he stood  charged. <p>The Lord Justice Clerk having. summed up.the evidence, the<br>Jury retired, and about ten o'clock returned a verdict of the Rape<br>not proven, and the assault with inten:  to ravish oroven by A plural- <br>ity of voices.<p>Lord M'Kensie, in proposing sentence, said,  that  had the jury<br>found the prisoner-guilty of rape, he would have had no alternative<br>but to propose  the sentence of death ; but even although the pri-,<br>soner was relieved of that crime, yet be stood  convicted of one of<br>the most  brutal and degrading assaulte, an assault committed. in<br>the forenoon  of the day, at a rime he (the prisoner)  was possessed<br>of his&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;sober senses,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The  crime was  also aggravated by the art,<br>cunning, and stratagem  used  by him to commit the foul and dia-<br>bolical deed.  Under  there circumssances, and many other consi-<br>derations, he could not propose less then that the prisoner should<br>be transported beyond seas for the natural period of his life.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In these sentiments  Lord  Moncrieff and the Lord Justice Clerk<br>fully concurred, and  M'Millan was accordiogly seutenced co tran-<br>sportation for life.<p>It was  remarked by almost every person who had admittance<br>into the hall where the girl M'Lauchlaue  was during the trial, that<br>she conducted herself in the most unbecoming  manner. The levity<br>she displayed was truly disgusting.<p>Thomas Yule pleaded guilty to breaking up the portmanteau of<br>a gentleman who  was lodging in his house, and stealing therefrom<br>30 Napoleons, a Dutch gold coin, and several other articles--Sen-<br>tenced to one  years' imprisonment in Bridewell.<p>James Hosie was then placed at the bar, accused  of having 'bor-<br>rowed&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;from&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ten  different  .spirit  dealers as many copper gallon<br>measures , and  from another a copper half gallon measure, and ap<br>propriating them to his own use.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He pleaded guilty to six of the<br>charges, and was  sentenced to one years imprisonment in Bride.<br>Well.<p>Forbes & Co. Primers , 171, Cowgate.  </p>
