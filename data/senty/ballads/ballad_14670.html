	<p> EXECUTION.<p><p>A Particular Account of the Execution of  John  Baird and Andrew <br>Hardie, who were Hanged and Beheaded at Stirling, on Friday the <br>8th day of September, 1820, convicted of High Treason.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  <p>STIRLING, 8TH SEPTEMBER,  1820.<p>This day, at one o'clock, the Sheriff's Depute and<br>Sobstitute of the county of Stirling, accompanied by<br>the&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Magistrates,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;preceded&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;by  the  Town&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and<br>Sheriff  Officers,  went  in procession from the Town-<br>House to the Castle,  to receive the prisoners at the<br>Castle Gate.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  They were met by the Lieut. Governor,<br>General Graham, when the Sheriff demanded the two<br>prisoners, HARDIE and BAIRD.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The gates were<br>thrown open, and a strong party of the 13th Regiment<br>under the immediate command of Colonel Sir William<br>Williams,  marched out and formed two lines, one on<br>each side of the road.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A squadron of the 7th Dragoon<br>Guards were already drawn up outside the Castle Gate,<br>and when  the  prisoners  arrived, formed outside the<br>Insantry, and also in front and rear of the procession.<br>The prisoners,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;who were decently dressed in black<br>clothes, with weepers and crape, attended by the three&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>Ministers of the Established Church, viz: Dr  Wright,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>Dr. Small and Mr Bruce, now came out of the Castle,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>and mounted  the Hurdle with a firm and undaunted<br>step.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The decapitator took his seat immediately be-<br>hind them, clad in a dark cloak and veiled with black<br>crape, holding up his weighty axe in the same appaling<br>manner in which he held it at Glasgow&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They bowed<br>to the crowd all around, and particularly to the Lieut<br>Governor and Fort Major.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Sheriff and Magis-<br>trates took their position immediately behind the small<br>party of cavalry which cleared the street.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Minis-<br>ters were placed at the sides of the hurdle, which was<br>guarded by two Sheriff Officers.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A strong detachment<br>of the 13th marched along,  and the rear was guarded<br>by a few Cavalry.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When the procession began to move<br>(which was at a slow pace) the prisoners sung the last&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>hymn in a. very audible and distinct manner, and con-<br>tinued to do so, except in the narrow part of the Cas-<br>tle Wynd, till, they arrived at the Prison, in front of<br>which the  Scaffold  was erected.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hardie looked  up<br>and smiled?Baird surveyed the dreadful apparatus with<br>earnestness, but composure.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Both the prisoners, but<br>especially Hardie, looked eagerly and keenly at their<br>veiled companion, but did not address him.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The pro-<br>cession, after arriving at the front of the Prison, halted;<br>the troops drew up, formed three sides of a square<br>around the Scaffold; the prisoners, with the Magistrates<br>and Ministers, proceeded to the Court-house, where<br>nearly an hour was spent in devotional exercises.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dr.<br>Wright first read the 51st Psalm, and prayed?Dr.<br>Small next read from the 7th to the 13th verse of the<br>same Psaim, which the prisoners sung with much devo-<br>tion, Hardie giving on the line and leading the sing-<br>ing&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  Dr. Small afterwards  prayed?The Rev.  Mr.<br>Bruce then gave out the 30th Psalm, which was sung<br>in like manner; and the devotions were concluded by<br>another prayer from Dr. Wright.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  The arms of the<br>prisoners were then pinioned, and after each had got a<br>glass of wine, they were conducted to the Scaffold.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>was prepared with all the insignia of death.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On each<br>side was placed the coffins with the block for decapita<br>tion, the floor was covered with saw-dust.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The prison-<br>ers then went on the platform at a quarter before three<br>o'clock.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On their appearance the crowd set up a faint<p>cheer. Baird then addressed the crowd in a very ap-<br>propriate .manner, and begged them to read and study<br>their Bibles as the Word of God; he made no interfer-<br>eace to the course which brought him and his unfor-<br>tunate companion to the situation in which they were<br>now placed. Hardie then addressed the audience, but<br>was not so distinctly as Baird; he said," I die a martyr<br>to the cause of truth and justice " The Crowd gave a<br>faint chear, and immediately, as if in a panic, they fled<br>towards the cross streets and closses. The ropes were<br>now affixed to the prisoners and to the traverse beam,<br>after which Mr. Bruce prayed very servently, and at<br>twenty minutes to three o'clock they were launched into<br>eternity. They hardly exhibited any struggle. After<br>hanging 25 minutes, their bodies were taken down by<br>the sheriff Officers, and placed on their respective cof-<br>fins with their heads on a block, and their faces down-<br>wards. When the necks were bared, the decapitator<br>came forward, and was assailed by the crowd with<br>hisses, yells, and cries of " Murder." He appeared to<br>be the same person who officiated at Glasgow, but he<br>completely lost his former firmness and dexterity. He<br>se't the neck of Hardie's corpse with his right hand,<br>raised his ponderous hatchet, hesitated, lowered it, ad-<br>justed the crape on his face, and raised it again, and<br>after two powerful strokes, a third slight touch was ne-<br>cessary to sever some of the adhering fibres and skin.<br>He then held up the gory head in his right hand, and<br>exclaimed, " This is the head of a traitor." He next<br>turned round to the corpse of Baird, and took his aim<br>apparently with less trepidation: the first stroke the axe<br>cut the neck slightly and stuck fast in the wood, but<br>the second severed the head from the body. He then<br>held it up also, streaming with blood, and made the<br>same proclamation, " This is the head of a traitor " and<br>retired. The mangled bodies were then taken inside<br>the Jail, and the crowd instantly dispersed.<p>HARDIE, though born in Auchinairn, was educated<br>in Glasgow. He was bred a weaver. He served in<br>the Berwick Militia upwards of five years, and was<br>discharged immediately after the battle of Waterloo.<br>He came home to his loom, and became a member of<br>the " Castle street Union Society," but never bore any<br>office. The society was given up before the end of<br>December. Upon the 4th April he was informed that<br>there was to be a great meeting that night at Germis<br>ton, he went to the place, but found only 30 or 40<br>men. They never separated till they were all seized at<br>Bonnymuir. He was 27 years of age; and has left two<br>youngers, a sister, and an aged mother.<p>BAIRD was born in the parish of Cumbernauld, and<br>bred a weaver. He enlisted into the 95th Regiment,<br>and belonged to it more than 7 years. He was in Spain<br>with Moore. When he was discharged, he settled at<br>Condorrat, and wrought at his trade till the beginning<br>of April, when he was taken in arms at Bonnymuir.--<br>He was 31 years of age, and unmarried. He has left<br>two brothers and an aged father to lament his death.<p>JAMES CLELLAND, who was to have been executed<br>along with Baird and Hardie, has received a respite<br>for one month.<p>Printed by John Muir, Glasgow.</p>
