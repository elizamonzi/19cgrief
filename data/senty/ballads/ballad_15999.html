	<h2>Transcription</h2>
	<p> A particular account of the Behaviour of James Gilchrist, who was executed at the Cross<br>of Glasgow on Wednesday the 20th of July, 1808, pursuant to his sentence, for the<br>cruel and barbarous murder of Margaret Brock, his wife, and his body given for<br>dissection.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <p>THE unfortunate man who was executed this<br>day, made no public declaration, and his<br>lamentable fate having been the topic of much con-<br>versation, in order as much as possible to satisfy the<br>minds of the Public, the following particulars<br>were collected:<p>He was a native of Glasgow, aged about forty-<br>seven, and, it is said, originally bred a gardener,<br>but afterwards learned the stocking-making busi-<br>ness, at which he was employed when the Shock-<br>ing affair took place which caused his melancholy<br>exit,<p>His behaviour during his confinement in the Tol-<br>booth here exactly corresponded with the sentiments<br>he expressed at the time of his trial. It will be re-<br>membered, when the Jury returned a verdict of<br>guilty, he immediately addressed the Court, and<br>said, " There certainly must be some misunder-<br>standing in this cafe; but, I declare before God,<br>and this audience, and as I have to answer to God<br>at the day of judgment, I am as innocent of this<br>crime as the child unborn. I knew nothing of my<br>wife till I got out of bed, and found her burnt.--<br>However, if it be the will of the Almighty that I<br>am to suffer, I die innocent,"<p>Although he did not court the attendance of the<br>clergymen who piously waited on him, yet, it is<br>said, he received them in a decent manner--in a<br>manner that appeared to say--I Still deny the crime<br>for which I am condemned,. but I am sensible your<br>friendly visits are for my eternal welfare, and merit<br>my gratitude.<p>There was something in the behaviour of this un-<br>fortunate man, both during his trial and confine-<br>ment, that could not but attract notice--nay, it<br>even attracted the attention of the learned Judge<br>who condemned him; for that honourable gentle-<br>man, in the course of his very eloquent and impres-<br>five-speech, which he addressed to Gilchrist on the<br>enormity of his crime, before he pronounced sen-<br>tence, said, Whether you are guilty or innocent<br>of the crime of which you are convicted, God and<br>your own conscience only know, but you must ac-<br>knowledge your trial has been a fair one.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Most<br>ably you have been defended, most patiently and<br>impartially you have been heard.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The evidence<br>against you is circumstantial, as in all cafes of the<br>kind it must necessarily be--with that evidence a<br>majority of the Jury are satisfied; and after what<br>you have just said, I think it but justice to that ma-<br>jority to state, that the whole of the Court are of<br>the same opinion.<p>This solemn address the unhappy man listened to<br>with the utmost attention, heard the dreadful fen-<p>tence with firmness, and replied,with great com-<br>posure--"If I was guilty, a hundred deaths were<br>too little for me; but, I thank the Almighty, am<br>innocent."<p>Had Gilchrist been a hardened ignorant man be-<br>fore the catastrophe happened, the above declara-<br>tions would have excited no kind of astonishment,<br>but the reverse was the case; for it appeared at<br>his trial, that, except when in a state of intoxi-<br>cation, both him and his wife were industrious and<br>decent in their conduct, and had lived twenty-seven<br>years a married life.<p>On the other hand, the depositions of four of<br>the witness, respecting the murder, was so clear<br>and distinct, that it was impossible there could be a<br>doubt left in the minds of the Jury of him being<br>guilty; and to suppose, for a moment, .that these<br>four persons had combined together to take away<br>the life of their neighbour, to whom they solemnly<br>swore they had not the Highest ill-will, would cer-<br>tainly be the highest injustice--it would be charging<br>sober industrious people, who, from their situation,<br>at the time the shocking affair took place were<br>bound to come forward, and tell what they saw and<br>heard, with a crime of the blackest dye--a crime<br>that would not be imputed to the vilest miscreants<br>without the clearest proof of their guilt.<p>Therefore, upon the whole, it must be sincerely<br>hoped, before he left this world, as he expected<br>pardon of God, through the merits of his Redeemer,<br>that he put the question of innocent or guilty be-<br>yond a doubt; which is a circumstance, much as it<br>may be wished for, was not publicly known on<br>Tuesday, when this account closed.<p>It is said a circumstance was discovered, a few<br>days before the execution, in the house at Slate-<br>field, in the neighbourhood of Camlachie, near<br>Glasgow, where the unfortunate woman was found<br>dead, and apparently murdered, which greatly<br>strengthened the rectitude of the verdict returned<br>by the Jury at the trial.<p>It appears, from the application made, and some<br>of the Jury being in his favour, Gilchrist had a<br>strong hope that he would get a reprieve--which<br>hope, it is said, he persisted in till Friday; and no-<br>thing coming forward on that day, he resigned him-<br>self to his fate, and began to look at his eternal wel-<br>fare in a more serious point of view.<p>He got every indulgence during his confinement<br>that could be bestowed on a person in his awful situ-<br>ation, and was assisted in his devotions till the last,<br>by the worthy and pious gentlemen who waited on<br>him.<p>Printed by Thomas Duncan,</p>
