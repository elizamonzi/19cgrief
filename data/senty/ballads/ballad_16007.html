	<p> GENUINE COPY,<p>Extracted, by permission, from the full Historical Narrative of M'KAEN's<br>Life and Transactions which is published by BRASH and REID, Book-<p>fellers Glasgow.<p>The Last Speech, Confession, and dying Declaration of JAMES M KAEN,<p>Who was Executed at the Cross of Glasgow on a new erected Gibbet, on Wednesday the 25th of January<br>1797, and his Body given to the Professor of Anatomy for Dissection, for the Murder and Robbery of <br>JAMES BUCHANAN, the Lanark Carrier.<p>I JAMES  M'KAEN, aged 44 years, was Born in<br>Glasgow, of reputable parents, my father died<br>when I was three years old and soon after my mo-<br>ther made a second marriage with a Book-printer in<br>Glasgow, my stepfather lived  but short time, and I<br>got my education in the time of her second widow-<br>hood, which was common reading and writing.<p>My mother made a third marriage with a journey-<br>man shoemaker, whom she set up as a master in Paisley.<br>He behaved extremely ill to her, for be wasted all of<br>her's he possibly could and then ran off and was ne-<br>ver more heard of.<p>When I was ten years old, I was bound an appren-<br>tice for seven years, to Mr. William Greenlees shoema-<br>ker in Glasgow, but he failing in trade my indenture<br>was destroyed, when I had served only two years of<br>the time; I was then sent by my friends to Dalkeith,<br>where my mother bound me an apprentice to Mr. John<br>Cowan, for two years more, which time I served out<br>all but three weeks, when I went to LANARK, I<br>got work there from a very good master for two years,<br>and then retrned to my mother at Dalkeith. She gave<br>me too much liberty with pocket-money which made<br>me fall into loose company.<p>When I was 16 years old, I courted a sober young<br>girl at Dalkeith, but having no rea[l] love to her in<br>my heart. I contrived a very odd scheme to get off<br>from her by affronting her; the particulars of which,<br>are set down at length in my full narrative.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  <p>At one period of my life, being at Musselburgh<br>with an acquaintance who was enlisting with a party<br>of Frazer's Highlanders which were then raising dur-<br>ing the time of the American war; while they, were<br>drinking the Crown Bowl of Punch usually drunk on<br>these occasions, an attempt was made to enli[s?]t or en-<br>tangle a friend of mine and me who had come toge-<br>ther with the Recruit, and the landlord of the house<br>where the party were drinking wishing to second<br>their design of entangling us, came in and declared<br>" we were all the king's men together." I was so<br>provoked at this conduct of the landlord, that I<br>threw the candlestick at him with such violence, that<br>it cut him thro' the check bone.<p>I acknowledge that I have all my life been subject<br>to violent gusts of passion so much so, that I could<br>not command my temper even when receiving but<br>slight provocation.<p>Short time after my marriage with my present<br>wife at Dalkeith, I acknowledge that I termed a cri-<br>minal correspondence with a young girl in the parish<br>of Libberton which is three miles from Dalkeith, and<br>she bore a child to me, it was a girl, and I, to get rid<br>of the scandal of a child in adultery, made public<br>satisfaction in the parish church of Libberton. I<br>know that I have been accused of the murder of his<br>child; But I declare, the charge is groundless.------I<br>have stated all that I know of the child in my full<br>Narrative, to which I beg leave to refer, nor doubt-<br>ing but the facts there recorded, will convince any<br>unprejudiced person that I am innocent.<p>With regard to another very heavy charge brought<br>against me by common report, viz. That I drowned<br>my Mother in the great Canal I am free to declare<br>as a dying man, that though I was the person who<br>called her out, I am totally innocent. I acknowledge<br>that the attrocious Murder for which I justly suffer,<br>gives great ground to excite this rumour against me,<br>but am sorry it is not in my power in the compass of<br>this Speech, to narrate what I have said in my Vindi-<br>cation from this charge. I have given a full account<br>of all that I know respecting this unfortunate affair<br>of my Mother's death, in my full Historical Narra-<br>tive, to which I again beg leave to refer.<p>With regard to the attrocious deed for which I<br>suffer. The Murder of JAMES BUCHANAN, I<br>confess, that for it I stand justy condemned both by<br>the law of God and man; yet I deny that I intended<br>or premeditated to take away his life, when he en-<br>gered my house on the fatal night. The reason of<br>my preparing the Razor in the manner that it was<br> tyed; the way in which I had an altercation with<br>BUCHANAN on an old grudge 'twixt him and I ;<br>the dreadful Murder I committed on him in conse-<br>quence of a sudden and violent gust of passion, the<br>manner in which I perpetrated the horrid deed; the<br>Robbery that followed, and the dreadful train of<br>circumstances attending the whole; together with the<br>horror of my feelings in this alarming situation, &c.<br>&c are fully detailed in the best manner I could pos-<br>sibly recollect, in my large Narrative. But these va-<br>rious particulars are far too extensive to be set down<br>in the small compass of this Speech.<p>I am conscious, having heard so, from Very re-,<br>spectable authority, that there are a variety of re-<br>ports propagated against me: Such as that I had de-<br>signed the death of Mr. Alexander, a worthy Sur-<br>geon is this city, now deceased. That I had broiled<br>my Mother's favourite Cat in a pot, and committed<br>many other acts of cruelty, &c &c. &c. These va-<br>rious reports I have noticed particularly in my full<br>Narrative, in which I have given the most ample ac-<br>count of my whole life. And I declare as a dying<br>Man, that every report which may be circulated a-<br>gainst me, which is not included in the said Narra-<br>tive, is totally and completely groundless.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<p>With regard to my trial, I confessed my crimes to<br>the court, of course the trial was but short ; I expe-<br>rienced every indulgence from the court, my Jury,<br>and the Judges, and I approved of their judgmemt,<br>for I thanked them in the Court for their decision,<br>after my sentence was repeated--On the 26th of<br>December 1796 I was transmitted back to Glasgow<br>according to my sentence, and was lodged again in the <br>Tolbooth there, where I have at all times received<br>every indulgence that possibly could be given, from<br>the honourable Magistrates, and the Keepers of their<br>Tolbooth.------To the worthy Clergymen of this city,<br>and neighbourhood, who have repeatedly visited me,<br>I return my most sincere thanks.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<p>I beg that no person will be so base, as insult my<br>innocent Wife and  family, with a recital  of my,<br>crimes, as they  had no hand whatever in any of<br>them. Placing my hope and confidence in the me-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>rits of him who suffered without the gates of Jerusa-<br>lem, the just for the unjust, whose blood we are as-<br>sured cleanseth from all sin, and who ordered that his<br>blessed gospel should be preached, first of all to his<br>murderers. I desire to commit my departing Spirit to<br>God who gave it.<p>JAMES M'KAEN. <p>Tolbooth, Glasgow 17th&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<p>January,  1797.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<p>Glasgow; printed by J. GALBRAITH.</p>
