	<p> THE&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;BURIAL  OF  MR GLADSTONE,<p>THE  GREAT POLITICAL  HERO.<p>A New Poem, composed May 1898, by Sir WM. TOPAZ  M'GONAGALL,<br>Poet, Knight of the White Elephant, Burmah,<br>No. 21 Lothian Street, Edinburgh.<p>Alas ! the people now do sigh and moan<br>For the loss of Wm. Ewart Gladstone,<br>Who was a very great politician and a moral man,<br>And to gainsay it there's few people can.<p>'Twas in the year of 1898, and on the 19th of May,<br>When his soul took its flight for ever and aye,<br>And his body lies interred in Westminster Abbey;<br>But I hope his soul has gone to that Heavenly shore,<br>Where all trials and troubles cease for evermore.<p>He was a man of great intellect and genius bright,<br>And ever faithful to his Queen by day and by night,<br>And always foremost in a political fight;<br>And for his services to mankind, God will him requite.<p>The funeral procession was affecting to see,<br>Thousands of people were assembled there, of every degree ;<br>And it was almost eleven o'clock when the procession left<br>Westminster Hall,<p>And the friends of the deceased were present?physicians<br>and all.<br>A large force of police was also present there,<br>And in the faces of the spectators there was a pitiful air,<br>Yet they were orderly in every way,<br>And newspaper boys were selling publications without delay.<p>Present in the procession was Lord Playfair,<br>And Baillie Walcot was also there,<br>Also Mr Macpherson of Edinboro?<br>And all seemingly to be in profound sorrow.<p><p>The supporters of the coffin were the Earl Rosebery,<br>And the Right Honourable Earl of Kimberley,<br>And the Right Honourable Sir W. Vernon he was there,<br>And His Royal Highness the Duke of York, I do declare.<p><p>George Armistead, Esq., was there also,<br>And Lord Rendal, with his heart full of woe ;<br>And the Right Honourable Duke of Rutland,<br>And the Right Honourable Arthur J. Balfour, on the right<br>hand;<br>Likewise the noble Marquis of Salisbury,<br>And His Royal Highness the Prince of Wales, of high degree.<p><br>And immediately behind the coffin was Lord Pembroke,<br>The representative of Her Majesty, and the Duke of Norfolk,<br>Carrying aloft a beautiful short wand,<br>The insignia of his high, courtly office, which looked very<br>grand.<p>And when the procession arrived at the grave, Mrs Glad-<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; stone was there,<br>And in her countenance was depicted a very grave air;<br>And the dear, good lady seemed to sigh and moan<br>For her departed, loving husband, Wm. Ewart Gladstone.<p>And on the opposite side of her stood Lord Pembroke,<br>And Lord Salisbury, who wore a skull cap and cloak ;<br>Also, the Prince of Wales and the Duke of Rutland,<br>And Mr Balfour and Lord Spencer, all looking very bland.<p>And the clergy were gathered about the head of the grave,<br>Then the attention of the spectators the Dean did crave;<br>Then he said "Man that is born of woman hath a short time<br>to live,<br>But, Oh, Heavenly Father ! do thou our sins forgive."<p>Then Mrs Gladstone and her two sons knelt down by the<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;grave,<br>Then the Dean did the Lord's blessing crave,<br>While Mrs Gladstone and  her sons knelt,<br>While the spectators for them great pity felt.<p>The scene was very touching and profound,<br>To see all the mourners bending their heads to the ground,<br>And, after a minute's most silent prayer,<br>The leave-taking at the grave was affecting, I do declare.<p>Then Mrs Gladstone called on little Dorothy Drew,<br>And immediately the little girl to her grandmamma flew,<br>And they both left the grave with their heads bowed down,<br>While tears from their relatives fell to the ground.<p>Immortal Wm. Ewart Gladstone ! I must conclude my muse,<br>And to write in praise of thee my pen does not refuse-<br>To tell the world, fearlessly, without the least dismay,<br>You were the greatest politician in your day.</p>
