	<p> Particular account of the unlucky affray that happened on Saturday evening at the<br>head of the Canongate, Edinburgh, between two Carters, viz. Alexander M 'Do-<br>nald and  George Sideserf, who lost his life by a blow from M'Donald. Like-<br>wise an account of that horrid and bloody Murder, committed on the body of<br>SERJEANT JENKINS, of the Pembrokeshire Cavalry, who was most cruelly stabbed<br>by one Buttler, a private of said regiment, in many places, of which he died in<br>about ten minutes, in great agony.<p>THE following melancholy accident<br> that happened between Alexander<br>M'Donald and George Sideserf, on  last Sa-<br>turday afternoon ought to be a warning to<br>put all people on their guard to avoid haf-<br>ty and unguarded passions, for if once rage<br>get the better of reason, but fora moment,<br>it is hard to say what it will lead to even in<br>the most trifling matters.<p>The cause of this unlucky quarrel was<br>which of them should have the service of<br>the porters first to carry their coals, and<br>after a few words M'Donald gave the other<br>such a violent blow as to cause his almost<br>instant death.<p>M'Donald was brought before the Ma-<br>gistrates and underwent an examination,<br>after which he was committed to the tol-<br>booth, until liberated by due course of<br>law.<p>Sideserf has left a wife and four children <br>M'Donald has six.<p>A most melancholy affair happened here<br>Friday night last, betwixt a Serjeant and<br>private of the Pembrokeshire Cavalry, both<br>of whom were upon guard that evening.<p>The private however left his station,<br>and without any just reason went to a pub-<br>lic house, and upon hearing some talk go-<br>ing on entered the room, the serjeant of<br>the guard happened to be with the Serjeant-<br>major and some others.<p>The private had no sooner interfered<br>with the company, than the Serjeant-major<br>ordered the ,other serjeant to take him to<br>the guard-house. Upon which the serjeant<br>instantly rose, and said to the private, come<br>you and I must go to the guard and attend<br>our duty.<p>Accordingly both of them left the room,<br>but they had not gone twenty yards when<br>a serious scuffle took place, in which the<br>serjeant received several deadly thrusts with<br>the private's bayonet, at the point of which<br>he was drove back to the public-house;<br>which, he had no sooner entered, than he<br>fell down, calling out, serjeant-major, I<br>am-killed.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <p><p>The private still kept thrusting him most barbarous-<br>ly with his bayonet, till the searjeant-major and the<br>rest of the company, being now greatly alarmed, in-<br>stantly seized the private, in doing which, the latter<br>aimed a desperate thrust at the serjeant-major,but very<br>fortunately the bayonet went through betwixt his arm.<br>and his side,<p>The private being now overpowered, was bound<br>and prevented from doing the mischief he then threat-<br>ened. The poor unfortunate serjeant expired upon<br>the spot, about ten minutes after he fell, without spe-<br>cifying the ground or circumstances of the quarrel.<p>The private was then taken to prison, and after-<br>wards brought back at the desire of one of the officers<br>that he might view the awful tragedy he had acted.<br>but alas! he appeared quite unaffected, and was bold<br>to vindicate and plead self-defence. The soldiers who<br>were present, upon hearing the bloody wretch thus<br>express himself, could scarce forbear piercing him<br>through with their swords.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <p>Whether he is guilty or not will probably soon be-<br>the subject of a Judiciary trial. In the mean time<br>his conduct is universally reprobated, and exhibits a<br>mournful proof of human depravity. It would be a<br>deed truly benevolent would some piousand judicious<br>person pay him a visit, with a view to impress upon<br>his mind a sense of his atrocious guilt, and the dan-<br>gerous ground upon which he now stands.<p>The serjeant was universally beloved in the regi-<br>merit, and has left a young disconslate widow to be-<br>wail his loss.<p>He was interred in the church-yard of Haddington,<br>Sabbath evening. There would, however, have been<br>much more propriety had the funeral been delayed till<br>Monday.<p>By a letter from Forsar, we learn, that another<br>melancholy and cruel murder has been committed on<br>the body of George Douglas, carrier in Montrose<br>who being in a public-house in Rankeilor taking re-<br>freshment, and a conversation having ensued between<br>him and some soldiers belonging to the Windsor For-<br>rester Fencible cavalry, one of them, of the name of<br>Joseph Cope, a corporal, instantly drew his sabare and<br>cut Douglas a deep wound in the head, of which<br>wound, after a lingering torment of twenty-two<br>days, he died, leaving a wife and several small child-<br>ren, to bewail his loss.<p>Cope has deserted and absconded, and a reward of<br>ten guineas is offered to any person who will seize<br>him, and lodge him in any of his Majesty's jails. He<br>was born in the county of Chester, is about twenty-one<br>years of age, five feet eight inches high, of a fresh,<br>complexion, with brown hair and grey eyes<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  </p>
