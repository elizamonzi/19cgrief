	<p> ADDRESS<p>TO<br>OF<p>Edinburgh<p>FELLOW CITIZENS,<p>In this enlightened age, when the advantages of local position<br>are justly esteemed paramount to those of intellectual superiority<br>or public eminence, I come forward boldly to claim your suffrages<br>on grounds altogether independent of my political principles or of<br>my mental qualifications. I have spent my life in occupations<br>which have secured my inefficiency and yet cherished self-esteem;<br>and have carefully avoided any intercourse or pursuits which, by<br>enlarging my views, or enlightening my mind, might have assimi-<br>lated me to my opponents, and prevented my appealing to you, as<br>I now do, On the sole ground of residence within the Burgh of Edin-<br>burgh.<p>I have, however, other, though inferior, claims to your support.<br>You are now in possession of a Franchise from which I laboured to<br>exclude you, and which, if I have the honour of being your Repre-<br>sentative, I shall lose no time in attempting to withdraw, as, if once in<br>Parliament, I should scorn to hold my seat on so frail a tenure as<br>the ever fluctuating voice of Public opinion.<p>You all admired the truly patriotic and prudent conduct of the<br>late Representatives of the Town Council of Edinburgh, and look<br>back with regret to the snug and quiet Elections in the City Cham-<br>bers, now, alas ! departed. It shall therefore be my earnest en-<br>deavour to restore to this City that old Burgh System in which I so<br>much delighted, and of which I am proud to term myself the last<br>Representative. I treated with scorn the Petition of 17,000 of my<br>Fellow-citizens in favour of that enlightened and distinguished in-<br>dividual whose place I am now anxious to fill, and supported Mr<br>ROBERT ADAM DUNDAS, with whose dignified and appropriate<br>contempt of public opinion I entirely concurred.<p>I am peculiarly well acquainted with the critical and embarrass.<br>ng situation of the Town's affairs, having had ample means of ac<br>luiring  information in consequence of my connection with  the<br>Old Town Councils, whose judicious administration has accumu<br>ated the load of debt by which you are at present burdened, and<br>of whose generous profusion of the public money I heartily ap-<br>prove ; being satisfied that their mode of Election and consequent<br>irresponsibility ensured for them that virtuous independence which<br>I am resolved to maintain.<p>The facility with which I exchanged the assumed liberality of<br>my first address for the high-souled Toryism of my present pro-<br>fessions, affords the best security for my steadiness and consist-<br>ency in Parliament.<p>The accuracy and correctness of my assurances on the subject of<br>the Town's affairs, the realization of which has been prevented by the<br>natural course of events, assures you of my ability and discretion ;<br>and while my opponent, SIR JOHN CAMPBELL, is evidently incapaci-<br>tated from being your Representative by that extraordinary union<br>of talent, industry and political consistency which has raised him<br>to the rank of Attorney General of England?I can sincerely assure<br>you that, had it been my lot to have entered the same honourable<br>profession, no such disqualification would ever have attached to<br>me.<p>I now confidently claim your Votes. Unacquainted with Politics,<br>I pray you to entrust to me the duties of a Legislator. My views<br>are limited to the confined sphere of my previous occupations.<br>call on you to send me to the extensive field of Parliamentary en-<br>quiry. 1 am attached to the Principles, and have been educated in the<br>School, of the Tories.?and I entreat you to exercise in my favour<br>those suffrages which I'sincerely wish had never been conceded to<br>you,<p>I have the honour to be,<p>Your known Friend,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;TIMOTHEUS SYNTAX,<p>For J.  LEARMONTH.</p>
