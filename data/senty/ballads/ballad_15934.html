	<p> Gauger in a Pit.<p>An Account of a Gauger's Travels betwixt Edinburgh and Gilmerton, after Smuggled<br>Whisky. His meeting with a party of Colliers, who conveyed him to the bottom of<br>a Coal Pit ; the awful Dream he had while in the pit : with the curious Trial, and Sen-<br>tence given by the Colliers.<p>IT is an old proverb, that two is better than one; that only one takes when both follow the same pur-<br>suit, a proof of this you shall have in the tragic story of a Gauger going a smuggler hunting; it being<br>in winter, and the night very cold and frosty, he considered it his duty to take a confident along with<br>him, for which he chose a bottle of good whisky, but unfortunately for the Gauger, he never consulted<br>the bottle to see if it was of the same mind as himself, for if the guager was on the pursuit for smugglers,<br>it appeared that the bottle was on the pursuit of gaugers. At this time he was stationed in the neigh-<br>bourhood of Edinburgh, and had received information of a party of smugglers who were coming from<br>Gilmerton with a cargo of spirits, the expectation of the seizure enticed this member of excise a few<br>miles in the country, and as I have mentloned, he took his companion the bottle of whisky, and when they<br>arrived at their destination they hide themselves for some time at the back of a ditch, when the gauger<br>  found himself beginning to shiver, and thought it prudent to take advice from the mouth of his com-<br>rade, whether they would walk on or not ; but the bottle was content any way, so after he had receiv-<br>ed the cordial advice from the bottle he laid himself down, ' And as he lay, he lov'd the treacherous<br>friend that every sence remov'd' So I have before mentioned, the night was extremely cold, which<br>made the mind of the Exciseman uncommon fickle and he took many advices from the bottle, whether he<br>would nor would not go forward and meet the Smugglers, but the many advices, had turned the Gau-<br>ger's brains, for when he rose he took the countrary road, which lead to a coal work near Gilmerton, but<br>did not advance a great way till he fell, and not being able to rise he fell fast  asleep, and there he lay ex-<br>posed to every evil of the night and drunkenness, but providence, who is kind to the unthankful cast<br>him in the way of some collier houses, who, as they were going to their work, found the unfortunate<br>wretch sound asleep, and almost dead with cold, and having a guess of their stranger, for curiosity they<br>lifted the guager, and put him inio'a creel, and carried him down the pit and laid him in a corner, and<br>went to their work, leaving the Guager to take his nap.<p>As the whisky began to deaden, he began to dream that he was hanging over a precipic with a river<br>running under him, from which he made many attempts to drink ; but as he got to the river, flashes of<br>fire struck between him and the water the torment of which was insufferable; but at last he awaked<br>finding himself in a land of darkness; for after he had felt all arround him, and found nothing but rocks,<br>he uttered some tremendous roars, at the hearing of which, the colliers came to see what was wrong ;<br>and as they approached him with their lamps in their hands, he considered them devils, and that he was<br>in hell; and the colliers asked him what made him roar so loud ??Gauger, Because I am dead. Collier,<br>Did you die ? Gauger, I do not know. Collier, Had you any trouble ? Gauger, The last thing that<br>I mind of was being druuk. Collier, And what brought you here ? Gauger, I do not know. Collier,<br> Do you know who's speaking to you ? Gauger, It is your honour, Mr. Devil.?Collier, What was you I<br>' Gauger, I was an officer of Excise in the last world, but God knows what I'm to be in this?Bad en-<br>ough, said the collier. But you have committed some crimes in the other world, for no person comes<br>here without crimes, and of yours we have a list, but we mean to extort confession from your own mouth '<br>at the hearing of the confession, the gauger clawed his head; but the collier told him that if he should<br>conceal the truth, or equivocate, they would station him on labour never to end; at the hearing of<br>which the gauger proceeded as follows :? May it please your Devilship, I have been a great sinner, for in<br>my youth I got a lass with child, and swore her out of it, I then married, and to the marriage-bed,  I<br>have been dishonourable ; besides I was in the habit of taking bribes from smugglers ; and about a fort-<br>night back I went to the house of a poor man and  seized a still ; and after seizing it I made a present of<br>. it to his wife for a kiss ; and after getting my will I seat another gauger and seized it' At hearing the<br>confession, the colliers held a court upon the offender, when it was considered, that the punishment<br>would to be send him back to the other world ; 1st, To father the child 2d. To be chase to the marriage<br>bed. 3d. Restore the value of the Still to the woman, and give up the excise. So, after they imposed<br>the oaths necessary, they sent him up in the bucket, and he was glad to see the creation again; but soon.<br>forgot his Promiser.<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Printed for ROBERT MARTIN.</p>
