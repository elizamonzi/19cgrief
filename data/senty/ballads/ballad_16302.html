	<p> EXECUTION<p>AT<p>ELGIN.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <p>An account of the Execution of ALEXANDER GILLAN, who  was executed at Speyside,<br>(the Place where the deed was committed) on Wednesday the 14th of November, 1810,<br>for ravishing and murdering Elizabeth Lamb?his body being afterwards hung in Chains,<br>pursuant to his sentence.<p>IT is almost impossible to describe the great<br>bustle which took place on the day appoint-<br>ed for the execution of this unhappy man, by<br>people of every age and sex pouring in from all<br>quarters, to witness his melancholy exit; but<br>every thing was so judiciously arranged that no<br>accident whatever happened, cither on the road<br>or at the fatal spot.<p>He was escorted to the place of execution by<br>a party of the 78th Regiment, from Fort<br>George, attended by the Reverend Mr. Gor-<br>don, of Elgin, and Mr M'Bean, of Alves,<br>Sir George Abercrombie, the Sheriff Depute,<br>the Provost and Magistrates of Elgin, several<br>of the county Gentlemen, and an immense<br>concourse of people, from every quarter, and<br>of every age and sex.<p>During the time Mr. Gordon delivered a<br>very impressive prayer, the criminal was con-<br>vulsed with the most agonizing throbs of<br>grief. For some time past, he has exhibited<br>symptoms of the most genuine repeatance,<br>and has appeared to be deeply impressed with a<br>sense of the enormity of his guilt, and of the<br>awful change he was about to undergo.<p>For this happy temper of mind he was<br>indebted to the attention of the neighbouring<br>clergy, but chiefly to the unremitting instruc-<br>tion and pious exhortation of the Rev. Mr.<br>Grant, of Eigin, whole benevolent exertions<br>could not fail of producing the happiest<br>effects.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  <p>After Mr. Gordon had finished prayer, the<br>criminal was clevated on a cart, from whence<br>he attempted to address the spectators, from a<br>paper which he held in his hand, and had pre-<br>pared for the occasion, but his agitation of<br>mind rendered him unable to proceed, and it<p>was given to Mr. McBean, but proved to be<br>only some extracts from the religious publica-<br>tions he had read during hit consinement.<p>After this, he became more tranquil, ascend-<br>ed the ladder without hesitation, and awaited<br>his fate with perfect resignation.<p>He was detained in this state of awful<br>suspense too long, by the unskilfulness of the<br>executioner, whole concern seemed directed<br>to the perquisites of the office more than the<br>business in which he was engaged.<p>When the drop gave way, so great was<br>the fall, that he yielded his spirit without a<br>struggle.<p>Having hung an hour, he was cut down<br>and put into irons, and he now remains<br>suspended to his gibbet, a  shocking example<br>of the dreadful effects of vice, when permit-<br>ted to usurp the empire of reason; an example<br>which, it is hoped, will strike deep into the<br>minds of the rising generation, and tend to<br>prevent the recurrence of such terrifying<br>spectacles.<p>Gillan was a good looking young man, abont<br>19 years of age, and always behaved himself <p>in a becoming manner till the time he commit-<br>ted the shocking deed for which he so justly<br>suffered an ignominious death.<p> He was a farmer's servant, and bore a good<br>moral character wherever he was employed.<br>It was a matter of great astonishment to every<br>person who was acquainted with bim that he<br>could be guilty of such dreadful crimes; but<br>his guilt was proved beyond a doubt, and the<br>hand of the Almighty was evident in its disco-<br>very, as was plainly shown upon his trial<p>T.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;DUNCAN,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;PRINTER.<p></p>
