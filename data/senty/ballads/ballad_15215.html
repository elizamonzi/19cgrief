	<p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;THE GILMERTON&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;MURDERERS,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&C.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <p><p>A Sketch of the Conduct, Transactions and Behaviour of DAVID DOBBIE and JOHN THOMSON, who were <br>Executed on  Wednesday the 18th August 183O, for Assault; Murder and Robbery, with their Last Dying<br>Confession, and Behaviour on the Scaffold, &c.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  EXECUTION.<p>THE nature of the horrible and disgust-<br>ing crimes for which these unfortunate<br>men suffered, is too well known to require<br>recapitulation here. After a trial which<br>lasted sixteen hours, they were unanimously<br>found guilty of robbery, assault, with intent<br>to ravish, and murder, and sentenced to be<br>executed on the 18th August 1830, and their<br>bodies to be given for dissection, when Do-<br>bie immediately exclaimed,  My Lord, it's<br>a grand thing ye canna disseck the soul ?'<p>They were confined in the same cell, and<br>were punctually and constantly attended<br>upon by the Rev. Dr. Lee and Mr Porteous.<br>Though they behaved quiet enough to one<br>another before their trial, they, immediately<br>after their condemnation, began to reflect on<br>one another very bitterly ; so much so in-<br>deed, that they were ultimately confined in<br>separate cells.<p>David Dobbie was 26 years of age, and<br>bad a look of much greater acuteness than<br>Thomson; when he was very young,his father<br>had his arm shattered by the upsetting of a<br>cart, so as to be unfit for labour, and it was<br>thus necessary that his numerons children<br>should sooner work for their bread than they<br>would otherwise have done. David, after he<br>learned to read and write tolerably, at the<br>age of eight, assisted his elder brother, who<br>drove a cart with yellow sand. In a few years<br>afterwards, he began to drive coals, and he<br>hadno opportunity of makingfurther progress<br>in his education, except at an evening school<br>occasionally. On the subject of the crime for<br>which he suffered, he had early given a state-<br>ment, to which, however, little credit can be<br>given. He said that he knew little more than<br>that Thomson had given him a tin box,<br>which box Thomson, on the other hand, deni-<br>ed that he had ever given him. Two or three<br>days after the crime was committed, Dobbie<br>gave this box to another man, stating that<br>he Lad found it. About the same time he<br>spoke with brutal levity to some of his com-<br>panions of the violence which Thomson had<br>committed. How far he was personally<br>concerned in this violence can never be<br>known. As he was home and in bed nearly<br>an hour before Thomson he had probably<br>no hand in some of the incredible outrages<br>of which the wretched female was the victim.<br>His wife and children are objects of deep<br>commiseration, and his parents, brothers,<br>and sisters, are not less so. Dobbie was a<br>man of a frank and forward dispositon, and,<br>though fearless of offending the feelings of<br>others, was often ready to perfom obliging<br>and neighbourly offices.<p>John Thomson was 21 years of age, and<br>was a tall slender man, with a face of little<br>meaning; he lost his father when he was 2<p>years old, but was sent some years to school,<br>where he learned to read and write, and to<br>repeat the Shorter Gatechism of the Church<br>of Scotland, with the Scripture proofs; this<br>useful manual had made little impression on<br>his mind, as he had long forgotten it. At a<br>Sunday evening school, for religous instruc-<br>tion, he had been exercised in other tasks,<br>but apparently with little effect; both he and<br>his companion seem to have thought, tha:<br>their attendance at this school was a suffici-<br>ent apology for absence from public worship,<br>and they considered the exhortations, which<br>they heard there, as an equivalent to preach-<br>ing. Thomson, at the age of 12 years, be-<br>gan to drive a cart with yellow sand, and he<br>afterwards became the driver of a cart with<br>coals, which he was in the habit of retailing<br>in small quantities among poor people, who<br>were unable to buy more than a hundred<br>weight or two at a time. While he led this<br>life, his chief companions were young men<br>of the same occupation, and for some years<br>past he has associated more with David Dob-<br>bie than with any other person, and has been<br>much addicted to drinking. According to<br>his own statement, he was always simple and<br>easy led, and scarcely ever had a good advice<br>from any person, with the exception of his<br>mother. On the fatal Saturday evening, when<br>the crime was committed, he had been drink-<br>ing more than usual, and they would not<br>have seen the woman who lost her life, if<br>Dobbie would have passed the public-house<br>where she came up to them. She had been<br>drinking much too. The atrocities, perpetrated<br>in the dead of night he has never detailed, and<br>though he has sometimes said that nobody<br>knew so much of the transaction as himself,<br>he has occasionally hinted that the injuries<br>might as well been inflicted by other hands<br>than either his or Debbie's. He sometimes<br>said that Dobbie was answerable only for the<br>robbery; at other times he said that this was<br>not the only act of which Dobbie was guilty ;<br>but though he was aware that Dobbie had<br>offered to become King's evidence, he general-<br>ly said that it was hard to take a man's life for<br>all that Dobbie had done. Expressions some-<br>times dropped from him, from which it<br>might have been inferred that he had bound<br>himself not to reveal what he knew of Dob-<br>bie's guilt,?but his general remark was,<br>that it could do no good now, and that the<br>declarations said to have been made by the<br>woman were in some respects not true, and<br>could not be correct, as she was so very<br>drunk" as to be incapable of remembering<br>any thing. He has never denied his guilt,<br>and he is said to have been employed, almost<br>without intermission, in reading the Scrip-<br>tures and ohter serious books, and in pray-<br>ing and singing psalms.<p>M A R G A R E T  PA T E R S O N,<br>Their unfortunate victim.<p>The crowd assembled to witness the exe-<br>cution was fully as great as on any similar<br>occasion for these several years; but there<br>was no shouting nor other indication of po-<br>pular feeling displayed. There was a great<br>number of people from the country present.<p>Yesterday morning these two criminals<br>suffered the last punishment of the law, at<br>the usual place of execution, for the atrocious<br>murder and robbery of Margaret Paterson,<br>committed on the road to Gilmerton in April<br>last. We scarcely recollect any person in<br>the situation of Dobie and Thomson, whose<br>fate has excited less commiseration. The<br>nature of the crimes for which they stood<br>accused almost precluded any feeling of pity;<br>and the magistrates, from a praiseworthy de-<br>sire that their names and infamy should die.<br>with them, refused access to all but relatives<br>and official persons. Thomson received the<br>final visit from his relatives on Friday last.<br>and the scene was highly affecting. Tues-<br>day night Dobbie was visited by his brother<br>and a friend. The criminals were taken from<br>the jail to the Lock-up-house in a carriage<br>on Tuesday afternoon about five o'clock, and<br>spent the evening in reading and devotional<br>exercises. About midnight they lay down,<br>but did not sleep. Before lying down Dob-<br>bie wrote to his wife and other relations, in<br>which he exhorted them to turn from the<br>evil of their ways, and seek for mercy through<br>the merits of the Redeemer. Thomson also<br>wrote to his mother ; his letter was very la-<br>conic. It merely stared that he entertained<br>hopes of pardon through the merits of Jesus<br>Christ, and bade her farewell. In the course<br>of the night Thomson washed his feet and<br>legs, as he said it might be more comfort-<br>able ; but his real object was different, and<br>his companion seemed to understand it, for<br>he said " Never mind, Jock, we will be well<br>enough scrapit in the College." This coarse<br>expression is perhaps as good an illustration<br>of Dobbie's character as can be given.<p>Shortly before six o'clock, the reverend<br>Dr. Lee and Mr Porteous were in attendance<br>upon the criminals.?They both exhibited<br>the utmost firmness and resignation, acknow-<br>ledged the many sins of which they had<br>been guilty, and expressed a sincere hope of<br>salvation through the blood of Christ. After<br>prayer and singing a hymn, a basin of tea<br>was given to each, and at a quarter past<br>seven, they came down stairs, and had their<br>arms pinioned. On entering the apartment<br>where the executioner was, Dobbie looked<br>wildly around, appeared much agitated, and<br>immediately exclaimed,  I thought we were<br>going up," (meaning to the scaffold). To<br>Thomson he said, " 1 hope the Lord will<br>have mercy upon us!" to which Thomson,<br>in rather an absent manner, responded, " I<br>hope so."?Thomson was throughout re-<br>markably composed ; he appeared indifferent<br>to all worldly matters, and never uttered a<br>word, except to questions asked ; and these<br>he generally answered by " Yes" or " No."<br>except in one instance, when she said, " I am<br>as composed now as ever I was in my life."<br>Dobbie, on the contrary, was unusally rest-<br>less and disturbed. He inquired the hour,<br>and wished to ascertain how long they would<br>remain in the house. When the executioner<br>commenced pinioning them, each seemed<br>much interested in the fate of his companion<br>?hut they did not speak. On entering the<br>apartment where Dr Lee and Mr Porteous<br>were, Dobbie in reply to a question as to<br>how he felt, said, " The Lord, I hope, has<br>given me strength.'' When asked, if they<br>wished any particular Psalrn, Hynm or Par-<br>aphrase, to be sung, Dobbie answered that<br>he wished the Hymn beginning " The hour<br>of my departure's come." It being mention-<br>ed that they had just sung that hymn up<br>stairs, he said, " Well, any one you like best<p><br>will do as well....sing the 51st Psalm." This<br>was done accordingly, commencing with the<br>words, " AM mine iniquities blot out;" and <br>both joined in singing. Mr Porteous then<br>prayed earnestly, the criminals kneeling. It<br>was during this scene that their feelings and<br>state of mind were most strongly marked....<br>Thomson threw himself on his knees...co-<br>vered his face with his hands, and continued<br>apparently anxiously responding to the pe-<br>tition put up on his behalf, but not a sound<br>escaped his lips. Dobbie's conduct formed,<br>on the other hand, a complete contrast to the<br>coolness, but not indifference, of Thomson.<br>At some parts of the prayer, particularly<br>those wherein their state as fallen men....the<br>situation of the village to which they belong-<br>ed, as being very wicked, and the helpless<br>condition of Dobbie's widow and children,<br>were alluded to, occasionally a deep groan<br>involuntarily escaped him, or the exclamation<br>of " Oh ay ?eh yes!" Before the prayer<br>was concluded, he rose on one knee, turned<br>half round, and convulsively grasped a psalm<br>book, which he held between his hands ; in<br>fact, every movement of his body and ex-<br>pression of his countenance conveyed, in<br>language too striking to be misunderstood, <br>the impression that his mind was ill at ease<br>?that his whole soul was awfully troubled.<br>They were then advised to pray by them-<br>selves, and both complied. Dobbie prayed<br>aloud, calling for " Help in this day of trou-<br>ble ;" " that the Lord would not hide Ms<br>face from him, but be merciful, for he was a<br>great sinner ;'' and similar emphatic Scrip-<br>tural expressions.?Thomson was not heard<br>to pray. On rising, they both thanked the<br>reverend gentlemen for their attention ; and<br>Dobbie said, " I hope our fate will be a<br>warning to that wicked place to which we<br>belong !'' To the Governor of the Jail, Mr<br>Rose, he said, " Will you look after my poor<br>wife and children ?" and an answer in the, .<br>affirmative seemed to give him great relief.<br>The condition of his family, we understand,<br>has preyed heavily on his mind. He again<br>returned to devotional exercises.<p>On the magistrates, Bailies Morton and<br>Anderson, being announced, both criminals<br>arose, and declared themselves ready; and<br>almost immediately thereafter proceeded to<br>the scaffold ? Thomson being assisted by<br>Mr Porteous, and Dobbie by Dr Lee. When<br>they reached Libberton Wynd, a sort of buz-<br>zing noise was heard from the crowd in the<br>Lawnmarket; this seemed to affect Dobbie<br>much, and Dr Black procured him a glass of<br>water, which he drank eagerly." (When on<br>the drop he again called for water, which<br>was given him.) On the platform, a portion<br>of the 40th psalm was sung, and Dr. Lee<br>prayed. The criminals then took their places<br>on the drop....the ropes were adjusted, and<br>they prayed for some minutes. In answer<br>to a question put to Thomson, he said his<br>sentence was just and proper; and Dobbie<br>at the same time said, " I do not deny my<br>guilt.'' Having bidden farewell to those<br>around them, Dobbie asked Thomson if he<br>was ready, to which the latter instantly re-<br>plied, " I am ready," and the former giving<br>the signal, the drop fell. Thomson strug-<br>gled more than his companion, but neither<br>appeared to suffer long.<p>After hanging the usual time, the bodies<br>were lowered down, and conveyed to the<br>Lock-up-house, previous to being delivered<br>to the Professor of Anatomy.<p>PRICE THREE-HALFPENCE.</p>
