	<p> DISAPPOINTED  LOVE&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  <p>A true account of a young Lady, a Gentleman's<br>Daughter, who Hanged herself in her own bed-<br>room at Dundee, on Monday last, 28th July<br>1823, for the love she bore to a Captain in the<br>Navy who deserted her, with a beautiful and af-<br>fecting letter which she Wrote to him the night<br>before she did the deed.<p>On the 28th of July Miss H-----n daughter of a respectable<p>Gentleman in this place, was found suspended from the ceiling of<br>her room. She made use of a silk scarf for the purpose; she<br>rose that morning very verly, and one of the servants in passing<br>her room, heard a noise, she went in to see, out was struck or<br>beholding the young Lady suspended from the ceiling : she cal-<br>led for asssistance, which soon arrived, but the lamp of life had<br>ceased 16 burn, and nothing was left to the friends but to weep at<br>her untimely and rash conduct. She would, at her father's death,<br>have fallen heiress to an income of about 4000l. a-year. A West<br>India Captain was the cause of this rash act, he having held out<br>promises which he never intended to fulfil, and who sailed for the<br>West Indies before her remains were laid in the silent grave.?<br>She sent him the following beautiful and affecting letter the night<br>before the sad event.<p>" Dear Captain, ? If my exhausted spirits would support my<br>trembling hand, whilst I write a few lines to ease a broken heart,<br>it would be the last office I should require them to do. Then<br>may they leave me ; then may I find in the grave a retreat from<br>the scorn of men. How is my gold become dim, and my most<br>fine gold become dross. I do not now command you by the aw-<br>ful name of virtue, to accuse you of the basest ingratitude ; ah,<br>no ! the scene is entirely changed : you have robbed me?Cruelly<br>robbed me of the brightest gem in the female's character, and I<br>come as an humble suppliant; Is this possible?am I awake, or<br>do I dream ? Ah ! poor deluded girl, think not what you were,<br>but what you are ; how can I rest from calling to remembrance<br>those days of innocence and peace, when, with a serene counten-<br>rnce and sincere heart I could look up to heaven, and beg that the<br>God of purity would be my protector ; but ah ! how am I changed,<br>how is my virtue faded, how doth conscious guilt fill my soul, while<br>blushes tover my face ; sad reflections on my present state hurry<br>me to meditate on the future, which opens so tremendous a scene to<br>my view, as to strike me back in doleful remembrance of the past.<br>Now Whither shall I fly to find relief ?<br>What charitable hand will aid me now ?<br>Will stay my failing steps, support my ruins,<br>And heal my wounded mind with balmy comfort.<p>If I fly to my parents, who were once all my comfort, they, bathed<br>in tears, cry out, You have brought our grey hairs with sorrow to<br>the grave?If, to get one moment's ease, I wander into the fields,<br>every flower I see seems to say, We are pure. Thus is all nature<br>armed against me. And on whose account do I seem to be for-<br>saken by heaven and earth ??on your account, who strove to gain<br>my affections, and become master of them ; and now you triumph<br>over me?laugh at me, for trusting to your honour, and putting<br>confidence in your word !<p>------ O inconstant men !<p>How will you promise !?how deceive !<p>O hypocrisy ! how couldest thou wear so winning a form ? Gener-<br>osity where art thou fled ? Hononr, hast thou forsaken the hu<br>man race? Look on my distress, O my God. Dispise me not<br>O my friends, Forgive me, my distressed parents ; then may th<br>cold grave receive me into its peaceful recesses, where my shame<br>may be buried in eternal oblivion. Now, if your heart be not as<br>hard as adamant, if your conscience is not seared as with a hot iron<br>some past scenes must appear to your view. I do not now summon<br>you to appear at His awful tribunal; I find you are still too near<br>my heart; for all your cruelty to me, my return is?May you, in<br>the hour of death find that consolation from your God and Judge,<br>you have denied to your&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;AMELIA H.<p>P. S.?With soothing wiles you won my easy heart,<p>You sigh'd, you vow'd, but, ah ! you feigned the smart;<br>Sure of all fiends the blackest we can find.<br>Are you ingrates, that stab our peace of mind.<p>Dundee, Printed for&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A Jones....Reprinted at Edinburgh.</p>
