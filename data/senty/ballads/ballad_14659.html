	<h2>Transcription</h2>
	<p> An account of the Trial and Sentence of William Mitchel, for Theft and Forgery, who<br>is to be executed at the west end of the Tolbooth of Edinburgh, on Wednesday the<br> 9th of October next.?Also, an account of the Trial and Execution of Samuel Tucker,<br>for the Murder of his Wife, which atrocious crime he perpetrated by starving her to<br>death, and for which he suffered at Salisbury, on Friday the 2d of August, 1811,<br>and his body was given for diffection;<p>ON Friday, the 23d of August, 1811,<br>came on the trial of William Mitchel,<br>before the High Court of Justiciary, at<br>Edinburgh,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;accused  of theft and forgery.<p>From the evidence adduced, it appeared,<br>that Mitchel had opened a chest, in the<br>house of Mrs. Duncan, Back Stairs, Cow-<br>gate, Edinburgh, where he lodged, belong-<br>ing to John Ferguson, another Lodger, from<br>which he took a watch, a considerable sum<br>in bank notes and cash, and a bill on the<br>Dundee Bank for L.48.<p>Having forged a letter, in the name of<br>Ferguson, setting forth that he was very ill<br>in his health, and unable to work, he pre-<br>sented it at the Bank, along with the bill<br>for payment.<p>But some suspicions having arisen that<br>all was not right, payment was delayed till<br>further inquiry could be made; and, in the<br>mean time, Mitchel received twenty shillings<br>from the cashier, for which he granted his<br>receipt, to carry him back again to Edin-<br>burgh, where he was apprehended a few<br>weeks after.<p>An attempt, On the part of the prisoner,<br>to prove an alibi having failed, the Soli-<br>citor-General addressed the Jury for the<br>Crown, Mr. Bell for the prisoner, and the<br>Lord Justice Clerk summed up the evidence<br>in a most distinct and impartial manner.<p>The Jury were then enclosed, and, hav-<br>ing deliberated for some time, returned a<br>verdict all in one voice, finding the pan-<br>nel guilty of the crimes libelled; upon<br>which his Lordship pronounced the sen-<br>tence of the law, ordaining the prisoner<br>to be executed at the west end of the tol-<br>booth of Edinburgh, on the 9th day of<br>October next.<p>SHOCKING MURDER.<p>SALISBURY,  JULY&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;31.<p>Samuel Tucker was indicted for the wil-<br>ful murder of Ann Tucker, his wife, at<br>Bradford, in the county of Wilts. This<br>was a case of the most atrocious kind. It<br>appeared in evidence, that the prisoner,<p>who was originally a weaver, but has prac-<br>tised medicine and called himself Doctor<br>Tucker, many months since conceived the<br>design of murdering his wife, on account<br>of the disparity of ages, she being about<br>25 years older than himself.<p>In order to effect her death, he kept her<br>continually confined in his house, without<br>allowing any one to see her from the 1st of<br>January last till the 8th of March last, on<br>which day she died, and giving her only a<br>small quantity of half-boiled potatoes and<br>barley bread, and a little water.<p>He frequently left his house for two<br>days together, during which she was locked<br>up, and without food; and her room, by<br>reason of the non-admittance of air, and<br>certain offensive things left therein, was<br>nearly sufficient to create putridity.<p>By this treatment she became so greatly<br>emaciated, as to be unable to move out of<br>her bed; during which time he still contin-<br>ued his ill treatment, and she was actually<br>starved to death.<p>The Surgeon stated, that, on examining<br>the corpse, it was literally nothing but skin<br>and bone.<p>The chief witnesses against the prisoner<br>were people of the name of Byfield, who<br>were the deceased's children by a former<br>husband.<p>The prisoner, in his defence, stated, that<br>his wife had a disorder in her bowels, which<br>prevented him from sleeping or associating<br>with her, and that she had a voracious appe-<br>tite, which could never be satisfied.<p>The Jury found him guilty, and the Judge<br>immediately passed upon him the awful sen-<br>tence of the law, and ordered him for ex-<br>ecution on Friday the 2d of August, and his<br>body to be delivered to a Surgeon, to be<br>dissected.<p>The prisoner appeared to be totally void<br>of agitation during the whole trial, which<br>lasted seven hours.<p>He confessed his guilt when at Chapel on<br>Thursday, and was executed next day.<p>Printed by T. Duncan, Glasgow.</p>
