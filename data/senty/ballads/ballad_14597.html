	<p> MURDER<p><p>An account of the shocking case of Mrs Anderson<br>St Giles Street, Leith, found strangled to death in her<br>house, on Monday morning  last, with the apprehen-<br>sion of one of her neighbours, accused of having com-<br>mitted the diabolical murder; also an account of the<br>Dreadful destruction of Cromerty new jail by Fire, on<p>Monday night, when&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;shocking to&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;relate, the keys<br>of the Prison were lost in the confusion, and before<br>the door could be forced open, the prisoners (whose<br>horrid&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;cries were&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;heart-rending) were  burned to<br>death,  and&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;so&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;reduced&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to ashes,  that&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the  bodies<br>could not be known by their relations.<br>A shocking affair occurred in Leith on Monday morning last un-<br>der very suspicious&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;circumstances.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A  woman&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of the name&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of<br>ANDERSON, residing in Lowrie's Close, Giles Street,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;had&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;been<br>drinking ou Sunday evening  with some 0f her neighpours,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; with<br>one of whom she had a quarrel.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Shortly after retiring to her own<br>house, a disturbance was heard between her and her companion, the<br>latter it&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;is  and  was  over  and  to  the&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  ANDERSON  whome&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;she  <p>left after having had a short scufle.<p>There was nothing more heard till next morning, when the ser-<br>vant of a gentleman in whose employ ANDERSON had occasion-<p>ally worked, called at her house and found the unfortunate wom-<br>an lying dead on the floor, with a great deal of coagulated blood<br>about her mouth and nostrils, which led to a belief that she had<br>been Murdered. On notice being given to the Police. the person<br>with with whom the deceased had quarreled was apprehended, and af-<br>terwards set at liberty, but has since been recommitted for further<br>examination,<p>It was discovered  thus morning  (Monday the 15th instant) be-<br>tween two and  three o'clock, that&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the Newly  erected Jail&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;was on<br>fire.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When the alarm was given, only the Westmost room&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;was<br>in flames but some  delay took&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;place in  getting&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jailors to<br>open  the Prison.<p>Upon the arrival of the Turnkeys, the keys were, after some<br>coufusion, obtained?but owing to some mistake in dsicovering<br>the proper keys, the fire extended to the passage, and no access<br>could be obtained to the prisoners in that portion of the Jail,<br>and the consequence has been that GEORGE ALEXANDER, an<br>Architect, in Golspie, and ANGUS M'LEOD, Innkeeper, Ballin-<br>trade, both confined for debt, along with M'LEOD'S wife who<br>came on a visit to him on Saturday last, besides a great number<br>of other prisoners whose bodies could not be kuown, have all been<br>burnt to death.<p>t was truly horrifying to hear the cries of the wretched suffer-<br>ers for assistance before they had been suffocated by<br>the smoke, The delinquents who were confined in<br>the tower adjoining the jail were most of them saved<br>from the dreadful configration and allowed to go at<br>large The jail and Court House, with the exception<br>of  he Tower, are all burnt to the ground, and no part<br>of them saved there being no fire engines in the place.<br>The portraits of MR M'LEOD Sheriff of Rosshire,<br>and MR MURRAY Provost of Tain, which were<br>placed in the Court Room, were with difficulty rescued<br>from the flames free of injury. It was was believed<br>that the fire was occasioned by some ashes being<br> placed in a wooden cinder bucket in the room where<br>the fire originated in which there was a considerable<br>quantity of straw which Ignited and gave rise to the<br>conflagration.<p>The bodies of ALEXANDER M'LEOD and his wife, have been<br>found in the ruins but neither of them can be distinguished they<br>are in such a mutilated state. Had the morning not been calm<br>ELLISON'S Hotel and Stables would also have been destroyed, as<br>well as the Office of the British Linen Company's Bank, but every<br>precaution has been made to prevent the fire from extending,<br>FORBES,and CO.PRINTERS, 171 COWGATE</p>
