	<p> Fatal Effects of Jealousy !<p><p>An Account of one of the most Barbarous Murders<br>ever heard of, committed by JOHN WILSON, near<br>Dundee, on Friday last, on the Body of his own<br>Wife, in a fit of Jealous Rage, by stabbing her in<br>several places and cutting her throat from ear to ear,<br>with a larga Carving Knife; also an Account of the<br>Murder of his own Infant, only eight days old, by<br>cruelly Dashing it on the ground, and afterwards<br>throwing it over a back Window, with the Intrepid<br>manner in which he was seized in the act by a ser-<br>vant Girl<p>LAST evening we were summoned to witness a scene from<br>which humanity recoils with horror and indignation ! a<br>scene, perhaps without a parallel since the first organixtation of civil<br>society. The circumstances are as follow: it appears that there had<br>been a fishing party during the day, composed, perhaps, of relations,<br>friends, and acquaintances, of whieh John Wilson was one.<p>On their return in the evening, accompanied by his brother-in-<br>law,and his wife, he appeared to be in an ill humour with his wife,<br>and pesceaded even to abuse ; but by the friendly interposition and<br>kind offices of the company there present, ha desisted for that time,<br>and the storm that appeared lowering, passed over without leaving<br>any an vestiges indicative of its recurrence ; but alas ? it vas a<br>most fatal security, into which he had hilled their suspicions.<br>When about to depart, he bade the sister of the wife, in an impres-<br>give manner to bid her farewell; but not suspecting the import of<br>this prophetic observation, they proceeded homewards.<p>Before they had been absent fifteen minutes, he commenced the<br>execution of his diabolical designs, by upbraiding her with iucon-<br>tinency, and ended his insulting and abusive language, by stabbing<br>her in the body with a clasp knife, which inflicted a deep wound in<br>her shoulder. Sho immediately fled, but in consequence of her de-<br>bility, occassioned by her having ,'giving birth to an innocent child<br>then not a fortnight old, he easily overtook her, and with a tremend-<br>ous blow, brought her senseless to the ground.<p>Commanding the assistance of a servant girl, who was close at<br>hand, he conducted her to the house, and placed her on the bed<br>when animation was soon restored ; he than with the most unex-<br>ampled ferocity, caught hold of the sleeping and innocent infant,<br>and with savage and unrelenting fury, dashed it with violence on<br>the ground, and again taking it by the legs, threw it forcibly over<br>the window into the yard behind the house.<p>Returning to the bedside, with his knife drawn and stained with<br>blood, he recommenced his abuse of his wife, and endeavoured to<br>extort confessions, by repeatedly stabbing her, renewing his inqui-<br>ries with hellish satisfaction at each scuccessive stab, while the mis-<br>erable victim of his cruelty, protested her innocence, and implored<br>his mercy with tears and intreaties, sufficient to soften the most<br>savage breast.<p>The servant girl, overcome with sympathy, profiting by his posi-<br>tion, seized him, and pushed him out at the door, thereby giving to<br>Mrs Wilson an opportunity to make her escape, which she employed<br>with as much alacrity as her weakened and wounded situation would<br>admit of, and had fled perhaps about fifty yards, when the unfeeling<br>monster overtook her, and dragging her by the hair of the head to<br>A considerable distance, put an end to her life, by cutting her throat<br>from ear to ear, in the most cruel and shocking manner ever wit-<br>nessed.<p>By this time, the alarm had reached the nearest neighbour, who<br>hastened directly to the scene of misery. The murderer, by this<br>time had exchanged the knife for 3. razor, and kneeling down in the<br>attitude of prayer beside the body of his murdered wife, was endea-<br>vouring to dispatch himself; he had completed part of his. design,<br>but finding the task more difficult than that of mnrdering his wife,<br>he only succeeded in making a slight incision in the windpipe, when<br>his hand was arrested, and it is hoped will recover, to answer before<br>an earthly tribunial for the perpetration of this unatural deed. Four<br>helpless children bewail the loss of their mother.<br>PRICE ONE PENNY.</p>
