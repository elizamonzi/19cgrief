On the 12th of May, being a<br>Monday, on coming home to dinner his wife told him<br>his daughter Margaret was lost. Witness went to<br>enquire at the Police Office; sent the town crier<br>through, but could get no information concerning her.<br>Next morning, about four oclock, rose and went to-<br>wards Whitehouse Toll, from thence to Leith, and<br>enquired at the Police Office there if they had seen a<br>strayed, child; got no information; returned home;<br>was told the child was certainly stolen ; went on the<br>Queensferry road ; enquired at every house, and some<br>women at a barn thought they saw a woman with a<br>child of the description he gave the day before, the<br>toll-man at Craigleath told him the same ; came to a<br>Miss Marshall's, who told him she had given a woman<br>with a child, who said she had come from the Cape of<br>Good Hope, a penny to help her over the Ferry.<br>Witness went to the Ferry, and found a woman and<br>a child had passed, but the boatman said he thought<br>the child was at the breast; and that he had taken<br>her over gratis. Witness returned to Miss Marshall's<br>and stated he did not think the child was his ; told<br>him to go a porter's lodge, where he got farther infor-<br>mation, and crossed the Ferry, went to a man who<br>had seen the woman with a child, who said she was<br>going to Dumferline, went to a magistrate, who or-<br>dered the lodgings to be searched. A man gave him<br>some information, and be went to Halheath, and<br>found the child in a house, but the woman was not.<br>She was out for some necessaries, and upon her return<br>he asked her where she had got the child, she said she<br>had got it at Edinburgh from her aunt. The child<br>had all its clother, but bonnet and slip, which it said<br>was in the woman's bundle, the child said that a wo-<br>man had taken her from Logan's entry, gave her<br>some sweatmeats, and said she would take her to her<br>grandmother. The woman said she had given her<br>child to her aunt to nurse, and had got this one in its<br>place; and if she was in Edinburgh, she would soon<p>clear herself. The pannel at the bar is the woman ;<br>he got a warrant and took her into custody. When<br>taken before a magistrate she acknowledged she had<br>stolen the child. When the child saw witness it ex-<br>pressed great joy, and took him round the neck and<br>kissed him,<p>Marion Brown, wife of the preceding witness, stat-<br>ed that the child left the house about half eleven o'<br>clock to go to a neighbour's house; she did not go<br>there, and every search was made for her, and wit-<br>ness did not see her till two days afterwards, when<br>her father brought her home, saying he had found her<br>at Halbeath Colliery ; the child was dressed in a light<br>frock, a green bonnet, and checked pin-afore.<p>Helen Brotherston, wife of John Anderson, labour-<br>er at Bell's mills, recollects the pannel coming to her<br>house on Monday, with a child, asking liberty to take<br>off her shoes and stockings, as it was a bad day, said<br>the child was her own. It. had on a light gingham<br>frock, and green bonnet. Woman said she was going<br>to Dunfermline to her father, who kept the head Inn<br>there. She named the child Jeany. The pannel at<br>the har, she is quite sure, is the woman,<p>Grace M'Pherson, wife of William Brown, at Brae-<br>head, parish of Cramond, recollects a woman with a<br>child coming to her house on a Monday in May, about<br>half past three o'clock, she wished to warm the child.<br>Witness asked her if she had carried the child from<br>the town, to which she answered she had carried it<br>from the Cape of Good Hope. Witness gave the<br>child some broth, but the woman said it could not take<br>broth with turnips in it. She said the chiln was three<br>years old, and was born on a new year's morning.<br>The child was not crying, but looked so pitiful that<br>witness asked her what ailed her; the woman said<br>she cried for her mammy, because, when in the Cape<br>of Good Hope, a woman kept her while she washed<br>clothes. The pannel at the bar, the witness is quite<br>sure, is the woman. Witness saw the child when ta<br>ken home on the father's back.<p>The Solicitor-General addressed the Jury in a very<br>few words; and Mr White for the pannel, in which<br>he endeavoured to show that there was not here a fel-<br>onious taken away?that pressed with extreme po.<br>verty and want, the pannel had taken the child for<br>the purpose of exciting compassion and procuring em-<br>ployment?that this was clearly proved by her in-<br>stantly proceeding to the colliery of Hallbeath and<br>getting into work; and he trusted that, from her<br>youth and ignorance, she would meet with the mercy<br>of the Jury.<p>The Lord Justice-Clerk having summed up the evi-<br>dence, the Jury without leaving the box, immediately<br>found the pannel GUILTY.<p>The Lord Justice-Clerk pointed out the enormity<br>of the crime she had committed, and sentenced her to<br>suffer the punishment of death in this City, on Wed-<br>nesday the 15th of October next.<p>Edinburgh: Printed for the Booksellers.?PRICE ONE PENNY.</p>
