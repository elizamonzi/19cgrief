Is this thy vow ?''<br>Sir James the Ross replied ;<br>And will Matilda wed the Grahame ?<br>Though sworn to be my bride.<p>His sword shall sooner pierce my heart,<br>Than 'reave me of these charms !"<br>Then clasp'd her to his beating breast,<br>Fast lock'd her in his arms.<p>" I spake to try thy love !" said she,<br>I'll ne'er wed man but thee:<br>The grave shall be my bridal bed,<br>Ere Grahame my husband be.<p>Take then, dear youth, this faithful kiss,<br>In witness of my troth ;<br>And every plague become my lot,<br>That day I break my oath.<p>They parted thus?the sun was set ?<br>Up hastily Donald flies.<br>"And, ? Turn'thee. turn thee, beardless  youth!"<br>He loud insulting cries.<p>Soon turn'd about the fearless chief,<br>And soon his sword he drew :<br>For Donald's blade, before his breast.<br>Had pierced his tartans through.<p>" This for my brother's slighted love!<br>His wrongs sit on my arm."<br>Three paces back the youth retired.<br>To save himself from harm.<p>Returning swift. his hand he rear'd<br>From Donald's head above.<br>And through his brains and crashing bones<br>His sharp-edged weapon drove.<p>He stagger'd ? reel'd?then tumbled down<br>A lump of breatbless clay ;<br>" So fall my foes !" quoth valiant Ross,<br>And stately rode away.<p>Through the green wood he quickly hied<br>Unto Lord Buchan's hall.<br>And at Matilda's widow stood,<br>And thus began to call :?<p>" Art thon asleep.  Matilda dear ?<br>Awake !  my love, awake !<br>Thy luckless lover calls on thee,<br>A long farwell to take.<p>For I have slain fierce Donald Grahame?<br>His blood is on my sword?<br>And far far distant are my men,<br>For to protect their lord.<p>To Skye I'il now direct my way,<br>Where my two brothers bile.<br>And raise the valiant of the Isle<br>To combat on my side."<p>" O do not so !" the maid replied,<br>" With me till morning stay ;<br>For dark and dreary is the road,<br>And dangerous is the way.<p>All night I'll watch you in the park?<br>My faithful page I'll send.<br>To run and raise the Ross's clan,<br>Their master to defend.<p>Beneath a bush he laid him down.<br>And row'd him in his plaid ;<br>While, trembling for,her lover's sate.<br>At distance stood the maid.<p>Swift ran the page o'er hill and dale.<br>Till, in a lowly glen,<br>He met the furious Sir John Grahame.<br>With twenty of his.men.<p>" Where goest thou, little page ?" said he,<br>" So late who did thee send?"<br>" I go to raise the Ross's clan.<br>Their master to detend ;<p>For he has slain fierce Donald Grahame?<br>His blood is on his sword ?<br>And far far distant are his men.<br>For to protect their lord."<p>" And has he slain my brother dear?"<br>The furious Grahame replies ;<br>Dishonour blast my name! but he<br>By me ere morning die.<p>Tell me where is Sir James the Ross?<br>I will thee well reward "<br>" He sleeps into Lord Buchan's park?<br>Matilda is h s guard."<p>They prick'd their steeds in furious mood,<br>And scour'd along the lea.<br>And reach'd unto Lord Buchan'n park<br>By dawning of the day.<p>Matilda stood without the gate.<br>To whom thus Grabame did say?<br>" Saw ye Sir James the Ross last night?<br>Or did he pass this way ?"<p>Last day at noon," Matilda said,<br>Sir James the Ross pass'd by ;<br>He urged his steed in furious mood,<br>And onward fast did hie :<p>By this time he's at Edinburgh.<br>If man and horse hold good."<br>" Your page then lied, who said he was<br>Now sleeping in your wood.''<p>She wrung her hands, she tore her hair?<br>'Brave  Ross thou art betray'd !<br>And ruin'd by those means," she cried,<br>" From whence I hoped thine aid."<p>By this the valiant knight awoke.<br>The virgin's shrieks he heard.<br>And up he rose and drew his sword,<br>Ere the fierce band appear'd.<p>" Your sword last night my brother slow.<br>His blood yet dims its shine :<br>But before the rising of the sun<br>Your blood shall reck on mine."<p>" You word it well." the chief replies.<br>" But deeds approve the man ;<br>Set bye your men?and. hand to hand,<br>We'll try whit valour can.<p>Oft bonsting hides a coward's heart;<br>My trusty sword you fear,<br>Which shone in front at Floddeu-Field,<br>While yours kept in the rear."<p>Then forward strode in dauntless mood,<br>And dared him to the fight:<br>The Grahame gave back? he fear'd his arm,<br>For well he knew its might.<p>Four of his man?the bravest four?<br>Sank down beneath his sword ;<br>Yet still he scorn  this base revenge,<br>And sought their haughty lord-<p>Behind him basely came the Grahame,<br>And wounded him in the side;<br>Out spouting came the purple tide.<br>And all his garments dyed.<p>Yet of his sword ne'er quit the grip,<br>Nor dropt he to the ground,<br>Till through his hateful enemy's heart<br>He pierced a mortal wound.<p>Grahame. like a tree by wind o'erthrown.<br>Fell lifeless on the clay ;<br>While down beside him sank the Ross,<br>Who faint and dving lay.<p>The sad ! Matilda saw him fall.<br>Oh. spare bis life !" she cried ;<br>Lord Buchan's daughter craven his life ;<br>Let, her not be denied."<p>Her well-known voice the hero heard,<br>And raised his death-closed eyes;<br>Then fix'd them on the weeping maid,<br>And weakly thus replies:?<p> " In vain Matilda begs a life<br>By death's arrest denied :<br>My race is race is run:?Adieu !" he cried,<br>Then closed his eyes and died.<p>The sword yet warm from his left side<br>With frantic hand she drew ;<br>I come ! Sir James the Ross !" she cried,<br>" I come to follow you."<p>She lean'd the hilt upon the ground,<br>And bared her snowy breast,<br>Then fell upon her lover's face.<br>And sank to endless rest.<p>SANDERSON, Printer, Edinburgh.<br>A varied assortment for the supply for<br>Hawkers and Travellers.</p>
