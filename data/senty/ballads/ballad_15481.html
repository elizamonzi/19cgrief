	<h2>Transcription</h2>
	<p> A Correct Account of the Trial and sentence of Peter Moffat, for tit<br>Murder of father, at Kilsyth, on the 2d April, 1822, and who<br>it to be Executed at Stirling, on Friday the 28th July, 1826.<p>ON Monday, 26th June, 1826, came on before the High Court of<br>Justiciary, accused of the wilful murder of his father, Peter<br>Moffat, late carter in Kilsyth, having, on the 2nd day of April 1822,<br>assalted and attacked the said Peter Moffat with a knife or other<br>lethel instrument, and inflicted several wounds in the belly of his<br>father, where of he died in four days thereafter.<p>After some observertations as to the removal of a sentence of out-<br>lawry which was formerly passed on the pannel, he pled not guilty.<p>Mrs Adams was the first witness called, She deponed?I live at<br>the Cross of Kilsyth. I remember old Peter Moffat, the father of<br>the prisoner. He got his death four years past the 2d April. He<br>was in my house between nine and ten o'clock that night. There<br>was no person in it at the time, but my own family and a daughter<br>of Moffat's, who was my servant. The prisoner was also in the<br>house?both the father and son were the worse of liquor. The<br>prisoner was asleep on the gronnd. The father kicked him, took,<br>hold of the hair of his head, and knocked it against the ground in<br>purpose to waken him. Old Moffat seemed angry with me for al-<br>lowing his son to lie on the ground, saying, he is as deserving of a<br>bed as the best of you.' The father continued to strike his son's<br>head ugainst the ground till he awoke, and said, ' it is all my own,<br>fault.' The father then struggled with the son, till the pannel was<br>set on the chair. The father again dadded his head against the<br>mantle piece, but the strokes, I think, were not violent, being mere-<br>. ly to awaken, but not to injure him. The father continued this<br>usage for some time, when the son said, " Damn it, if you were not<br>my father I would not thole that." He then rose and seized his<br>father by the throat. I ran out to get assistance, but before I got<br>to the door I think the son had couped his father on the ground. On<br>my calling, Mrs Gulies, Jean Nicol, and James Johnston came in,<br>and pulled the father and son asunder. Old Moffat then went out,<br>and the prisoner wished to get out, when I said, " Just let him gang,<br>he winna meddle wi his father." He then went out, lifting the cat<br>bar of the door himself, and having the open knife in his hand, and<br>holding it in a horizontal position. After an absence of a few mi-<br>nutes he returned, and said,------"Goodwin," and sat down by the<p>fire. I did not speak to him, but hearing a running on the street,<br>I went to the door, and heard a cry that Peter Moffat had sticked his<br>father. I then said to him, " Oh, Peter, you have sticked your fa-<br>ther," and he replied,' there is nothing like giving them their tatoes<br>when one is at it, they can peel them when they are ready." I said,<br>" Oh man, it was an awful thing to draw a knife on your father"<br>I then went out, leaving him sitting, and he was gone before I re-<br>tuaned. I never again saw him till in Stirling jail.<p>The Lord Advocate in addressing the jury, dwelt very much on<br>the horrid nature of the offence with which the prisoner stood<br>charged. It was that of the highest crime known in the law of<br>Scotland,....murder, and to which was added the frightful aggrava-<br>tion of its having been perpetrated by a son, imbruing his hands in<br>the blood of a father.<p>Mr John Russell, in a singularly able and eloquent manner, ad-<br>dressed the jury for the pannel, contending, that the very atrocity<br>of such a crime, a crime which wrs repugnant to the laws of God,<br>of nature, and of man, raised doubts of its having been perpe-<br>taated, and consequently called upon the jury to sift such a case<br>-the more closely.<p>The Lord Justice Clerk, at great length, summed up the evidence<br>to the jury, laying down the law applicable to it with his usual per-<br>specuity, and giving it as his opinion that it was a case of murder.<p>The jury, after an absence of a few minutes, returned a verdict<br>of " finding the pannel Guilty as libelled." .<p>Lords Mackenzie and Alloway severally delivered their opinions,<br>after which the Lord Justice Clerk proceeded to pronounce the last<br>awful sentence of the law, which he, we thought, did with more<br>than usual solemnity, but spoke so low as to be heard but very<br>indistinctly. He said he had been convicted of a crime which re-<br>flected a disgrace upon the county within the bounds of which it<br>was committed, which could hardly ever be wiped  away. He had<br>been convicted of murdering his own father... the author of his<br>being....the individual whom he was bound by the laws of God and<br>of nature, to have protected even at the risk of his own life. It was<br>a crime which no circumstance could justify nor palliate....even in<br>. the degree of violence used by the father their was no hostility....<br>and between 'that aggression and the inffliction of the wound, such<br>an interval of time elapsed, that the pannel had time to reflect on<br>on whom he was to lift his hand. His Lordship then read the sen-<br>tence of the Court, ordaining the pannel to be executed at Stirling,<br>on Friday the 28th July next, and his body thereafter to be given<br>to Dr Monro for dissection.</p>
