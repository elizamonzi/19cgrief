	<p> Trial & Sentence<p><br>A Full and Particular Account of the<br>Trial and Sentence of JAMES DAL.<br>RYMPLE, for the Horrid and Cruel<br>Murder of DONALD FRASER, Labourer,<br>on Sunday the 23d February last, on<br>the road near Linlithgow, by Shooting<br>him, and who is to be Executed on<br>Wednesday the 3d June, 1840.<p>Edinburgh, 13th May 1840.?The trial of James<br>Dalrymple came on here before the High Court of<br>Justiciary, this day, accused of the murder of Don-<br>ald Fraser, labourer, on Sunday the 23d day of<br>February last, in so far as, " on the road leading<br>from Linlithgow to Queensferry by the Burgh-<br>muir and Hoptoun-wood toll-bars, in the county<br>of Linlithgow, and within 300 yards of the said<br>Burgh-muir toll-bar to the west thereof, or between<br>the said Burgh-muir toll-bar and Burgh-muir farm-<br>house, situated on or near to the said road, and now<br>or lately occupied by John Jamieson, farmer, you<br>the said James Dalrymple did wickedly and felon-<br>iously discharge a gun or fowling-piece loaded with<br>gun-powder, and with leaden shot or pellets, or<br>some other hard substances to the Prosecuter un-<br>known, at Donald Fraser, labourer, then or lately<br>before residing with Duncan Macfarlane, publican,<br>then and now or lately residing in or near Linlith-<br>gow, and the said shot or pellets, or part thereof,<br>having struck the said Donald Fraser on or near<br>his neck, left side, and back, or other parts of his<br>person, he was thereby mortally wounded, and<br>immediately or very soon thereafter expired, and<br>was thus murdered by you the said James Dal-<br>rymple." To which he pled Not Guilty.<p>Several witnesses were then examined in support<br>of the charge, whose evidence distinctly described<br>the circumstances of the case.<p>Exculpatory evidence was called to prove the<br>disorderly conduct of several Individuals speaking<br>the Gaelic language on the same roan on the night<br>libelled; as also the uniform good character and<br>peaceable disposition of the pannel.<p>The Jury were then addressed by Counsel for<br>the Crown, contending that whatever might be their<br>feelings for the pannel in this case, they were bound<br>to find against him a verdict of murder ss laid in<br>the indictment. Mr P. Robertson, at grert length,<br>followed for the pannel, holding they were entitled<br>to bring it in only as Culpable Homicide.<p>Lord Meadowbank then went over the whole<br>evidence, and explained the bearings of the law in<br>such cases. The Jury after a short consultation,<br>returned with a verdict finding the pannel Guilty<br>as libelled, by a majority of three, but unanimous-<br>ly and strongly recommending him to mercy. He<br>was then sentenced to be Executed at the usual<br>place of Execution, in the Lawnmarket, on Wed-<br>nesday the 3d of June, 1840.<p>Menzies, Printer, Bank Street.</p>
