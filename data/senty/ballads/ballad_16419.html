	<p> The Flight of Ages<p>SING&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;AGAIN&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;THAT&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SWEET&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;REFRAIN<br>Those&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wedding&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bells  shall&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;not&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ring&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Out<br>JUST&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;AS&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;THE&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SUN&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;WENT&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;DOWN<p>Those Wedding Bells shall not Ring Out.<p>A sexton stood one Sabbath eve within a belfry grand,<br>Awaiting signal from the church with bell-rope in his hand,<br>As in the house of worship stood a young and happy pair,<br>To pledge their troth for evermore each other's love to share.<br>The holy  man then  spake these words?"Before you're joined<br>for life,<br>Has any person aught to say 'gainst you as man, and wife?"<br>Then down the aisle there came a man with quick and eager<br>tread,<br>And pointing to the trembling bride these words he calmly said<p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; CHORUS<p><p>"Those wedding bells must not ring out, she is another's bride<br>I saw her at the alter rail, we stood there side by side,<br>She cannot claim another's hand?she dare not break the<br>law's command,<br>A guilty wife you see her stand! Those bells shall not ring<br>out!"<br>The minister was speechless and the bridegroom stood amazed,<br>The congregation spell-bound sat, and thought the man was<br>crazed.<br>The bride had not a word to say, but simply hung her head.<br>"Who is this man?" the preacher asked, "I know him not,"<br>she said.<br>"Then ring the bells," the bridegroom cried, the man knealt<br>to entreat,<br>The sexton swung the chimes, aloft the bells rang clear and<p>sweet.<br>But scarce their music had begun when forth there came a<p>shout,<p>"Stand back! I say, they shall not ring, those bells shall not<br>ring out."<p>CHORUS?<p>"Those wedding bells shall not ring out, I swear it on my life,<br>For we were wedded years ago?and she is still my wife!<br>She shall not break her vows to me?she's mine through all<br>eternity,<br>She's mine till death shall set her free?those bells shall not<p>ring out ."<p>A shriek of woe, a glit'ring blade, a lurch, a flash, a dart-?<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And, like the lightning's stroke the blade had reached her<p>trembling heart,<br>"You' ve killed his bride, Oh God !" they cried! He swung the<p>gleaming knife,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>And pierced his own heart as he gasped, nay, not the bride,<p>my  wife.<p>Two forms lay cold within the aisle, the husband and the bride<br>As once in life he claimed they stood in wedlock side by side.<br>His vow was kept, the bells had ceased, and with his dying<p>breath,<p>These words once more he murmured ere his lips were closed<br>in death?<p>The Flight of Ages<p>I heard a song, a tender song,<p>'Twas sung for me alone,<br>In the hush of a golden twilight,<p>When all the world was gone ;<br>And as long as my heart is beating,<p>As long as my eyes have tears,<br>I shall hear the echces ringing<p>From out the golden years.<br>I have a rose, a white, white rose.<p>'Twas given me long ago,<p>When the song had fallen to silence,<br>And the stars were dim and low ;<p>It lies in an old book faded,<br>Between the pages white,<p>But the ages cannot dim the dream<br>It brought to me that night.<p>I have a love, the love of years,<p>Bright as the purest star,<br>As radiant, sweet, and wonderful,<p>As hopeless and as far;<br>I have a love, the love of years,<p>It's light alone I see,<br>And I must worship hope and love,<p>However far it be.<p>It is the love that speaks to me<p>Is that sweet song of old,<br>It is, the dream of golden years,<p>Those petals white unfold:<br>And every star may fall from heaven,<p>And every  rose decay,<br>But the ages cannot change my  love<p>Or take my dream- or take my dream away.<p>Copies can always be  had at 'the Poets' Box,<p>Sing again that Sweet Refrain.<p>A music hall was crowded in a city o'er the sea,<p>Brilliant lights were flashing everywhere,<br>Songs and witty sayings filled the audience with glee,<p>For the minster from the sunny South was there.<br>The minstrel sang a song about his old plantation home,<p>Upon the Swanee River, far away,<br>When the aged darkie who had sat in silence and in gloom,<p>Arose, and this is what they heard him say?<p>"Oh sing again that sweet refrain?dat's what de ole folks say<br>It brings me back to slavery days, befo' I was called away.<br>Upon de Swanee Ribber's  banks?dat's whar I used ter roam,<br>Now I'se ole and grey and far away from de ole folks at home!<p>The minstrel sang the song again; his eyes grew bright with<br>tears;<p>The aged darky sat with head bowed low ;<br>And something in his heart awoke, had slumbered there for<br>years?<p>'Twas the memory of a mother, long ago!<br>The hall resounded with applause, and as the curtain fell,<p>The aged darkie tottered on his way ;<br>He was thinking of the minstrel and the song he sung so well,<p>And the words that made him rise and say :?<p>Oh, sing again that sweet refrain, &c.<p>Just as the Sun went Down<p>after the din of the battle's roar,<p>Just at the close of day,<br>Wounded and bleeding lay upon the field,<p>Two dying soldiers lay.<br>One held a ringlet of thin grey hair,<p>One held a lock of brown,<br>Bidding each other a last farewell,<p>Just as the sun went down.<p>CHORUS?<br>One thought of mother at home, alone,<p>Feeble, old, and grey,<br>One of the sweetheart he'd left in town,<p>Happy, young, and gay.<p>One kissed the ringlet of thin grey hair,<p>One kissed the lock of brown,<br>Bidding farewell to the dear old flag,<p>Just as the sun went down.<p>One knew the joy of a mother's love,<p>One of a sweetheart fair,<br>Thinking of home, they  lay side by side,<p>Breathing a farewell prayer,<br>One for his mother so old and grey,<p>One for his love in town.<br>They closed their eyes to the earth and skies,<p>Just as the sun went down.<p><p>Then came the news from a comrade's lips.<p>One who'd survived the fight,<br>Two hearts nigh  broken?two noble lives lost,<p>Fighting?defending the Crown-<br>Still, they were proud of the heroes who died.<p>Just as the sun went down.<p><p> Overgate Dundee.</p>
