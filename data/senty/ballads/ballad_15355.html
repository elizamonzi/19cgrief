	<h2>Transcription</h2>
	<p> Account of one of the most shocking murders ever read of, com-<br>mitted by John Matw. Williams, at Milledge, on the body<br>of his own Wife, by stabbing her in several parts of the body<br>and cutting her throat from ear to ear ; also an account of his<br>murdering his own infant only eight days old, by dashing it<br>on the ground, and throwing it over the window, on Tues-<br>day the 15th of July, 1823 ; likewise an account of the gallant<br>manner in which he was seized by his servant girl.<p>Last evening, we were summoned to witness a scene, from which humanity recoils<br>with horror and indignation ! a scene, perhaps without a parallel since the first orga-<br>nization of civil society. The circumstances are no follow : it appears that there had<br>been a fishing party during the day, composed, perhaps, of relations, and friends, and<br>acquaintance, of which party John M. Williams, the person who committed the cruel,<br>shocking and inhuman deed, was one. On their return in the evening, accompanied<br>by his brother-in-law and his wife, he appeared to be in an ill-humour with his wife,<br>and descended even to abuse; but by the friendly interposition and good offices of<br>the company there present, he desisted for that time, and the storm, that appeared<br>lowering, passed over without leaving any vestiges indicative  of its recurrence; but<br>alas! it was a most fatal security, into which he had lulled their suspicions! When<br>about to depart, he bade the sister of the wife, in an impressive manner, to hid her<br>farewell; but not suspecting the import of this propheac observation, they proceeded<br>homewards.<p>Before they had been absent fifteen minutes, he commenced the execution of his<br>diabolical designs, by upbraiding her with incontinency, and ended his insulting and<br>abusive language, by stabbing her in the body with a clasp knife, which inflicted a<br>deep wound in her shoulder. She immediately fled, but in conseqence of her debility,<br>occasioned by her having given birth to an innocent child, then not a fortnight old,<br>he easily overtook her, and with a tremendous blow, brought her senseless to the<br>ground.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <p>Commanding the assistance of his servant girl, who was close at hand, he conducted<br>her to the house, and placed her on the bed, when animation was soon restored ; he<br>then with the most unexampled ferocity, caught hold of his sleeping and innocent<br>infant, and with savage and unrelenting fury, dashed it with violence on the ground,<br>and again taking it by the logs, threw it forcibly into the yard behind the house.<p>Returning to the bed side, with his knife drawn and stained with blood, he recom-<br>nenced his abuse of his wife, and endeayoured to extort consessions, by repeatedly<br>stabbing her, renewing his inquiries with a hellish satisfaction at each successve stab,<br>while the miserable victim of his cruelty, protested her innocence, and implored his<br>mercy with tears and intreaties, sufficient to have softened the most savage heart.<p>The servant girl, overcome with sympathy, prosting by his position, seized him, ano<br>pushed him out at the door, thereby giving to. Mrs. Williams an opportunity to make<br>her escape, which she embraced with as much alacrity as her weakened and wounded<br>situation would admit of, and had fled perhaps about fifty yards, when the unfeeling<br>monster overtook her, and dragging her by the hair of the head to a considerable dis<br>tasce, put an end to her life, by cutting her throat from ear to ear, in the most crue<br>and shocking manner ever witnessed.<p>By this time, the alarm had reached the nearest neighbour, who hastened direct;<br>to the scene of misery. The murderer, by this time, had exchanged the knife for a<br>razor, and kneeling down in the attitude of prayer beside the body of his murdered<br>wife, was endeavouring to dispatch himself ; he had completed part of his design, but<br>finding the task more difficult than that of murdering his wife; he only succeeded in<br>making a slight incision in the wind-pipe, when his hand was arrested, and it is hoead<br>will recover, to answer before an earthly tribtnal for the perpetration of this Unnatu-<br>ral deed. Four helpless children bewail the loss of their mother.<p>Copied from the Free Press Newspaper, Glasgow.<br>W. Carse, Printer  Glasgow.</p>
