	<p> A NEW SONG<p>FOR THE ELECTORS OF THE<br>COUNTY OF MIDLOTHIAN.<p>TUNE.?" The Young Lochinvar."<p>Oh! The gallant Sir John is a Knight of renown,<br>And from London post-haste he has lately come down,<br>Having fairly got out of that innocent scrape<br>Of the Banners, and Mottos, and bits of Black Crape ;<br>So that trumpery story may pass and begone,<br>Nor stain the fair fame of the gallant Sir John !<p>To be sure there arc some, who, in their simple way,<br>Still give an account of " that glorious day,"<br>Which, were it believ'd, it were awkward to tell<br>When a Knight has explain'd his own story so well;<br>But of these foolish people there surely is none<br>Whom you'd weigh in the balance with gallant Sir John !<p>Though half of our town's folk the TREASON might see,<br>Or think that they saw it?'tis nothing to me?<br>They were only spectators?and can you suppose,<br>That they either could see or describe it like those<br>Who were part of the mob, or perhaps led it on,<br>Or harangued on the Hustings, like gallant Sir John !<p>Nay, though AYTOUN himself, the disclaimer disclaim<br>That would rob him of half of his well-earned Fame,<br>And though others like Aytoun?if others there be?<br>Should spurn the attempt?still 'tis nothing to me?<br>For well do I know that the sun never shone<br>On a mirror more bright than the shield of Sir John !<p>If some bigot, to this, like D????------------, replies,<br>" I chuse after all to believe my own eyes"?<br>Though 'twere hard to condemn him, 'twere surely more<br>hard<br>To question the faith of The SCOTTISH  BAYARD?<br>For one must  recur to the days that are gone<br>To find a compeer for the peerless Sir John !<p>Full oft have I heard my Grandmother tell<br>As a curious fact that " TRUTH" lies in a well,<br>And oft have I thought if there it is found,<br>It must follow, of course, that it's hard to be drowned;<br>And since this affair, I am sure there is none<br>Who knows this so well as the gallant Sir John !<p>Then long may He flourish in honour unstain'd !<br>No offence, no mistake ?not a doubt?unexplain'd!<br>And may our Electors no longer be blind<br>To the inborn strength of a Statesman-like Mind,?<br>And if he have rivals, why, let them come on,<br>And measure a lance with the gallant Sir John !</p>
