	<p> The  whole&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; particulars&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of that  fight<br>between&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.Johnston&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and Pat Holton,<br>which&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;took&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;place yesterday,  Monday<br>(7th March 1825, for a heavy sum of<br>money,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; about&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;12&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; miles from Edin-<br>burgh.<p>(Extracted from the Account given in this day's Edin. Observer.)<p>  Yesterday being the time appointed for this momentous en-<br>counter, and being saint Monday besides, every  drunken  son of<br>Crispin, and every knight of shreds and patches was early on the<br>move ler Winchburgh.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Irishmen fight tor pleasure, Englishmen<br>for fame, and Scotchmen when they can't help it,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The last love<br>to lock on however.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The place of rendezvous,  through&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;fear of<br>unchivalrous beaks, had been kept a profound  secret to  all  but<br>the knowing ones.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the morning, however, the humblerfrends<br>of the fancy scented the ardour  of preparation,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;circle  of<br>action was a comfortable lea field, on the farm of Kirkland, on<br>the southern bank of the Union Canal,  nearly&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;midway between<br>Winchburgh and Broxburn.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The ground was soon covered  by<br>an immense concourse of spectators.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; All sorts of drags  were in<br>tremendous requisition, from the potent chariot and four, followed<br>by unnumbered pupils of the quoniam attachiamenta down to the<br>humble apple cart of our Irish hucksters.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Not a few of the peep-<br>ers were of rank enough to feel queer should they have been sus-<br>pected of any vulgar prediliction for a mill.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  But the love of claret<br>levels all distinctions.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At  a&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;few&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;minutes&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;before&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;two&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;o'clock,<br>Gypsey Johnson threw his castor into the ring, with the air of a<br>Hector, amidst the applauses, of thousands.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  His second&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;imme-<br>diately attached his ensign, in the shape of a blue belchar, to the<br>ropes of the ring.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In ten minutes after, Halton, an ugly  carotty-<br>cropped Potatoe, made his bow, an I was received with similar plau-<br>dits&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  His second unfurled a green wipe, in honour of the&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;grassy<br>bills of his country.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Both men, on peeling, seemed prime  meat.<br>Johnson carried at least a couple of stones&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;more  than&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Halton,<br>But Paddy was a perfect Logimanus ; his feelers being about the<br>dimonsions of a couple of ordinary flails.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The candidates having<br>skyed a copper for the sun, came to the scratch at two o'clock.<p>Round 1,__Johnson opened the budget but seemed queerish,<br>acting on the defence ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;made the periphery of the ring.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Halton<br>came  up,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;however,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and tipped  him a touch on the trunk;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;this<br>was well met and returned by a teaser on the capitol, which Hal-<br>ton  graciously&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;acknowledged by an&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;instantaneous  prostration,<br>Johnson above.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  Old England for ever.<p>2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A short round.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Johnson shewed first claret from the snot-<br>cock: a smart rally ; some tolerable  weaving;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;much  outerhouse<br>practice&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and"  both down,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gypsey undermost.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  Huzza  for Old<br>Ireland.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <p> 3. Halton tried art experiment on the Gypsey's pudding bag,<br>but the enemy was too quick for him Johnson tried a return,<br>but the compliment was met by a tep on the magazine that hurl-<br>ed him out of the ring. Johnson kissed the sod beyond the<br>ropes....The Hill of Howth to a frosted potatoe for Pat.<p>4....Both down, Johnson uppermost.<p>5 ...A well contested  round, and lasted four minutes.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; John-<br>son still fighting  shy,  followed round  the ring&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;by Halton, who<br>got his devter ogle,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;obnublated&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;by a&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;discharge&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;from Johnson's<br>maniple? Hurra for Johnson ; come it quick, and you'll win.<p>6.  Johnson alive, made good play ; sent a shaker alter Patrick's<br>knowledge box.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  Pat shyed the favour however, and caught the '<br>compliment  on&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;his&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;shoulder.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Halton&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;turned&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;quaker; a sharp<br>rally, both down, Johnson under...Shouts for either.<p>7. Johnson aimed a tremendous corporation hit,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pat returned<br>by a facer,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Both turfish.<p>8. and 9.  Lots of sparring, but no harm, both down.<p>10. A hard fought round, Pat put in his  favourite  facer, and<br>stopped a right handed return from Johnson. Halton punished<br>his adversary round the ring, close to the ropes. The Gypsey<br> made a desperate effort. The enemy skulked, but the suspension<br>was refused with costs against Halton. Johnson fell from a ting-<br>ler on the left lug, that rendered him deaf to time. Halton was<br>proclaimed victor, with small punishment.<p> A second fight was attempted to be got up between another<br>Irish cove, named Newton De Besrie and Neat, but after wait-<br>ing some time, De Berrie said Neat had declined the hoaour.<br>The true cause however, we believe, was that the stuff was not<br>posted with sufficient freedom.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  <p>The fight was said to have been for Fifty sovereigns.</p>
