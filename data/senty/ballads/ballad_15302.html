Also an account of the trial of Donald McKenzie who was sentenced to fourteen years transportation.<p>Donald Rankine was put to the bar, to receive sentence in consequence of a verdict of guilty of robbery being found against him at the Circuit Court of Inverary, but remitted to this Court to try the validity of an objection made by the prisoners counsel respecting an error in the date of the verdict and which had subsequently been decided. After a subsequent address by the Lord Justice Clerk, and information given the panel, that the recommendation of mercy should be transmitted to the proper quarter, he was sentenced to be executed at Inverary on Friday, the 18th day of January next, between the hours of 2 and 4 o?clock. ?
