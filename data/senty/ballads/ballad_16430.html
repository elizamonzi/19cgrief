'twas a tussle to.<br>The swifts got the ball, and took to their gallopers,<br>And scored " first goal against the macalvenny walloper<br>At this result there was a bit of wrangling,<br>The wallopers swore the swifts desarved a mangling.<br>They claimed "off-side,' and the referee big Stevenson,<br>Disallowed  the goal, just to make the game an even one<br>The swifts give way, and then to work they flew again,<br>They captured the ball and swore they'd put it through.<br>again.<br>One of them jumpad on the wallopers custodian,<br>And he lost more teeth than there keys a  melodeon.<br>The swifts' back play and splendid power of tackling,<br>Set their supporters a-crowing and a-cracklinig.<br>"Off side,' on side, every side and suicide,<br>Before half time they were only playing two a side.<br>When half time came the result was wired and cabled,<br>sure:<br>No goals each and a dozen men disabled, sure.<br>Refreshments for them there were none in the pavilionso<br>They went to a pub, kept by old John McGillion, oh!<br>But when they got there a stop was put to any peace,<br>'Twas found that amongst them they hadn't got a penny<br>piece.<br>"We must have a drink." said big Johnny Garrity,<br>"Supposing we drink what we drew to-day for charity.'<br>This was agreed to without any more plavring;<br>They paid for the full of every pot in the tavern,<br>With meat and drink every member  did his stomach<br>cram,<br>Then to the spectators thay sent a telegram,<br>Telling them politely themselves to go and smother,<br>As the football  was burst,  and they couldn't buy an<br>other.<br>Then to go for the umpire each one was clamouring;<br>They give them what I'd call a very healthy hammering<br>The poor referee in his shoes was trembling,<br>To see half a-dozen around him assembling.<br>He tried to escape, but they shook him like a water<br>mouse,<br>Closed both his eyes, and left his face like a slaughter-<br>house<br>Pitchersand jugs in the heat of there ferocity,<br>Flew through the room with lightning velocity.<br>The boss of the pub from the place quickly hunted them,<br>Then in the street another thing confronted them,<br>A band of policeman sized this gang of rioters,<br>And now they're teasing oakum for the prison-house pro-<br>proietors</p>
