	<p> THE  BLACKBIRD<p>Upon a fair morning for soft recreation,<br>I heard a fair lady was making her moan,<br>With sighing and sobbing and sad lamentation,<br>Saying, my blackbird most royal is flown,<br>My thoughts they deceive me,<br>Reflections do grieve me,<br>And I am o'erburthened with sad misery;<br>Yet if death should blind me,<br>As true love inclines me,<br>My blackbird I'll seek out wherever you may be.<p>Once in fair England my blackbird did flourish,<br>He was the chief blackbird that in it did spring,<br>Prime ladies of honour his person did nourish,<br>Because he was the true son of a king;<br>But since that false fortune,<br>Which still is uncertain,<br>Has caused this parting between him and me,<br>His name I'll advance,<br>In Spain and in France,<br>And I'll seek out my blackbird wherever he be.<p>The birds of the forest all meet together,<br>The turtle has chosen to dwell with the dove,<br>And I am resolved, in foul or fair weather,<br>Once in the spring to seek out my true love,<br>He's all my henrt' treasure,<br>My joy, love, and pleasure,<br>And (justly my Love) my heart follows thee,<br>Who art constant and kind,<br>And courageous of mind,<br>All bliss to my blackbird where'er he may be.<p>In England my blackbird and I were together,<br>Where he was still noble and generous of heart,<br>And woe to the tirae that he went thither,<br>Alas! he was forced from thence to depart,<br>In Scotland he's deem'd,<br>And highly esteem'd,<br>In England he seemeth a stranger to be,<br>Yet his fame shall remain,<br>In France and in Spain,<br>All bliss to my blackbird where'er he may be.<p>What if a fowler my blackbird has taken,<br>Then sighing and sobbing will be all my tune,<br>But if he is safe I will not be mistaken,<br>And hope yet to see him in May or in June,<br>For him through the fire,<br>Through mud and through mire,<br>I will go for I love him to such a degree,<br>Who is constant and kind,<br>And noble in mind,<br>Deserving all blessings wherever he be.<p>Tis not the ocean can fright me with danger,<br>Nor though like a pilgrim I wander forlorn,<br>I may meet with friendship in one that's a stranger,<br>Much more than of one that in Britain is born,<br>I pray heaven so spacious,<br>To Britain be gracious,<br>And some their odious to him and to me,<br>Yet joy and renown,<br>And laurel shall crown,<br>The blackbird with honour wherever he be.<p>JAMES KAY, GLASGOW.<p>MY  NAME IS<br>DUNCAN CAMPBELL<p>My name's Duncan Campbell, from the shire of Argyle,<br>I have travelled this country for many a lono- mile ;<br>I have travelled through England, and Ireland, and a<br>And the name I go by is bold Erin-go-bragh<p>One night in Auld Reekie, as I walked down the street,<br>A saucy policeman I chanced for to meet.<br>He glower'd in my face and gave me some jaw,<br>Saying, when did you come over from Erin-go-bragh?<p>I am not a Paddy, though Ireland I've seen,<br>Nor am I a Paddy, though in Ireland I've been,<br>But though I were a Paddy, what is it to you '<br>There's many a brave hero from Erin-go-bragh.<p>I knew you're a Paddy by the cat of your hair,<br>But you all turn Scotchmen as soon as you come here,<br>You've left your own country for breaking the law,<br>We are seizing all strangers from Erin-go-bragh.<p>Well, though I were a Paddy, and you knew it were true,<br>Bat were I the devil, pray what's that to you?<br>If it were not for your baton that you hold in your paw,<br>I would show you a game played in Erin-go-bragh.<p>There is a switch of a black thorn I hold in my fist,<br>Across his big body I made it to twist;<br>And the blood from his napper I quickly did draw,<br>Aud I paid him stock and interest for Erin-go-bragh.<p>The people came round me like a slock of wild geese,<br>Saying, stop that that big rascal, he has kill' d our police,<br>And for one friend I had, I'-m sure he had twa,<br>It was very hard times for poor Erin-go-bragh.<p>But I came to a wee bont that sails in the Forth,<br>I packed up my awl, and siled for the North;<br>Farewell to Auld Reekie, and police and a',<br>May the devil go with you, says Erin-got bragh.<p>Come all you brave fellows that hear of this song,<br>I don't care a farthing to where I belong,<br>For I'm from Argyleshire in the Highlands so braw,<br>But I ne'er took it ill when called Erin-go-bragh.</p>
