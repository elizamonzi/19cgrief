	<p> A Fully True, and Particular Account of that Awful<br>Bloody BATTLE for the BREEKS! that was<br>Fought last Saturday Night, in'this Neighbourhood,<br>between a Sprightly Young Couple, who had been<br>married a whole Fortnight; and which did not end<br>without Torn Clothes, Broken Heads,.and Bloody<br>Noses; together with a Copy of the Articles of<p>Agreement' made between them, after the Battle was<br>over!<p>A Sprightly, good-looking young couple was married about three<br>weeks ago in this neighbourhood, who lived most loving, a-<br>greeable, happy, and contented for the first twelve days or so ; bless-<br>ing the fortunate and lucky moment they first met, and the still<br>luckier moment they were buckled together in the happy bonds of<br>wedlock. But, alas ! alas ! little did they know about it yet, every<br>rose has its thorn, and every sweet its bitter.<p>The young wife conceived the idea one morning, of going out<br>after break-fast to visit some of her friends and old acquaintances,<br>which she accordingly did, promising to her husband to be home<br>in good time to give him his dinner; but, having called at several<br>different places, and staid some short time at each place, gossiping<br>and tasting ,a little of the mirth-inspiring John Barley-corn, forgot<br>her promise and her beloved&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;spouse at the same time, and staid<br>too long.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  On arriving at home, in rather a high key, as the saying<br>is, about nine o'clock in the evening, and on her husband's gently<br>questioning her where she had been all day, with  whom  she had<br>staid so long after the time she promised to be home, and why she<br>did not come to give him his dinner at the proper hour ?&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She<br>haughtily answered, that he had no business with where she was,<br>with whom she staid, nor why she did not come home sooner;<br>" for," says she, " I don t think I am at all answerable to you for<br>my conduct, you impudent fellow."&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The pool? husband on hearing<br>such language and viewing such behaviour, from his hitherto mild,<br>modest, loving spouse, looked quite amazed, and was absolutely at<br>a loss what to think or say, or how to act, for a moment; but, re-<br>covering a little from his astonishment, and  observing that the<br>fumes of the barley-bree had evidently got into her upper, storey,<br>and was the real cause of the wonderful change in her conduct and<br>appearance, he turned round to her quite vexed and angry, and ve-<br>hemently cried out, " what is the matter with you, woman, are you<br>drunk ?" " Drunk," replied she, in a perfect fury with rage, anger,<br>and whisky, " give me such  another word,  sirrah, and I'll make<br>your face ring against the wall, you brazen faced rascal," at the<br>same time accompanying the words  with the action, by instantly<br>giving her beloved husband a slap 011 the chafts.<p>Behold now, all you married people, the spell is thus broken,<br>which, by a little attention and prudent management, might long be<br>preserved, the source of much mutual comfort, joy, and happiness ;<br>but which, in their case, as now plainly appeared to every person.<br>led to a very different result indeed. For, no sooner the husband<br>received this rather rude salutation on his cheek, than he returned it<br>ten-fold, conceiving his manhood and authority, as lord and master<br>of the house, to be questioned, and in danger of being assumed by<br>his partner, who, he conceived, ought to know better, at least, " he<br>was determined to make her know her duty. Such a scene then fol-<br>lowed that beggars all description?stools, chairs, tables, tongs, po-<br>kers, dishes, &c. flew in all directions, and the noise, bustle, and<br>screaming brought all the neighbours to this scene of havoc, blood,<br>and confusion, which lasted a considerable time.<p>At last, however, as might well be expected, the wife got a good<br>threshing, and cried mightily for a parley, which, through the inter<br>ference of some of the bystanders, was soon obtained. She then fell<br>down on her bended knees, and piteously implored forgiveness, ac-<br>knowledging her fault, in the most submissive terms, and promising<br>faithfully never to be guilty of the like conduct again.<p>The husband seeing her now in this humble and submissive pos-<br>ture, began to relax in his severity, and feeling symptoms of return-<br>ing affection, (for he had married her really for pure love,) forgave<br>her all that passed, on the following easy conditions :<p>ARTICLES OF AGREEMENT.<p>I.  That she should never get drunk, either at home or abroad, again.<p>II.  That she should never let the packman nor the tailor kiss her<p>again.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And, Lastly, That she should never attempt to break<p>his head with the brass candle-stick or the ladle, nor his  nose<br>with the three footed stool.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To all which she solemnly agreed.<p>Upon which he sent for two bottles of Strong  Ale which  they<br>drank, and repaired immediately after to bed where all recollection of<br>their animosities were buried in oblivion, and peace and unity firmly<br>established for the future.<p>Edinburgh. Printed for A Turnbull..Price One Penny.</p>
