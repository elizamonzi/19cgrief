	<h2>Transcription</h2>
	<p> Copy of a Love-Letter from a British Soldier, at present in Holland, to his Sweetheart<p>in this City.<p>My Dearest Mary,<p>RELIEVED for a moment from the din<br>of arms, with pleasure unutterable,<br>my love, I dedicate that moment to thee;<br>what signifies the fatigues I undergo, and<br>the dangers I daily encounter,-they seem<br>a pleasure to me, when I reflect, that I do<br>so for the sake of my bonny bonny Mary.<p>May that innocence and virtue which<br>first inspired our love still keep possession<br>of thy breast, and we shall yet be  happy;<br>for, believe me, Mary, my love, respect,<br>and regard for thee are unalterable ; nay,<br>the farther I remove from thee, the stronger<br>thy dear image presses on my heart, and<br>raises  a Hope that makes every perilous<br>situation in which I am placed seem per-<br>fectly agreeable.<p>I once thought your father one of the<br>most cruel men alive; but now I think<br>otherwise. Heaven knows what was the<br>agony of my heart that day he forbid me<br>again to enter his house; and how every<br>angry word he said to thee pierced my very<br>soul!-Had I stayed much longer, even<br>though he was the father of all I held dear<br>on earth, I could not have commanded my<br>passion; but that Providence which has  pre-<br>served me ever since in safety, while my<br>companions in arms fell on every side, and<br>in the midst of dangers, that would make<br>thee shudder to relate, ordered it otherwise<br>-I said not a word-but cast one longing<br>look at thee, and departed. I knew not<br>where I went-had the river interrupted<br>the course I took, I dare say I would have<br>tumbled in, and, perhaps, never more<br>been heard of; for an indescribable torpi-<br>tude seized every faculty, and I knew not<br>that I existed, till chance or some good an-<br>gel led me to the hawthorn tree where first<br>we vowed to be constant till united. <p>At the sight of it I instantly revived-<br>sat down under it-every surrounding ob-<br>ject pleased me, and called to my remem-<br>brance the sweet moments I have often<br>here enjoyed ; but, alas ! how fleeting are<br>all earthly enjoyments.-Silent sorrow<br>soon succeeded the pleasure I felt-I wept<br>unpitied and unseen. However, I  soon<br>became cool, and here formed the resolu-<br>tion of entering into the army, with the<br>fond hope that I might, perhaps, gain in<br>the character of a soldier that which was<br>wanting to make our marriage agreeable<br>to your father, or lose a  life, which, with-<br>out thee, I counted rather a burden than a<br>blessing.<p>I immediately inlisted, and, from that<br>moment, studied nothing but what might<br>render me useful and agreeable to the of-<br>ficer under whose command I might be<br>placed.<p>Every thing, my dearest Mary, has suc-<br>ceeded to my wishes-I am now esteemed<br>by one of the best of Captain's as a brave<br>and complete soldier ; and, through his in-<br>fluence, I have been already raised to the<br>rank of a serjeant.<p>As it was soon discovered I had got a to-<br>lerable education, and paid the strictest at-<br>tention to my duty, I am often employed<br>in services which turn out to my advan-<br>tage.<p>Fear not my dearest Mary-we shall yet<br>be happy,-whatever the chance of war<br>may give to me  shall be your's.<p>We are both but young-this war soon<br>may terminate-or some other unforeseen<br>circumstance may call me home, when<br>it will be in my power, if your parents<br>should give you nothing, to support you in<br>a comfortable manner; for before I sailed<br>I was apprized of the death of my uncle,<br>so that the property that comes to me, and<br>what I may here accumulate, will answer<br>every purpose.<p>Think on these things, my Dearest Mary,<br>and be happy-until that much-wished<br>for period arrives, while life remains, I<br>am your's, and your's only,<p>J. T.<p>Glasgow: -Printed by Thomas Duncan, Saltmarket.</p>
