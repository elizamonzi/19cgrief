	<p> A most Strange and Wonderful Account of the Cour-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>age and Intrepidity of JOHN M'GREGOR, a Bri-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>tish Sailor, belonging to the ship called the York&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>Merchant, commanded by Captain BEAMS, who,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  <br>When that vessel was lying in  Carlile Bay, on see-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>ing a sincere Friend of his, belonging to the same&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  <br>Ship, snapped through the middle by a large Shark&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  <br>while bathing, jumped into the sea, armed with a&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  <br>large sharp pointed knife, and pursued the vora-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>cious monster.  Also an Account how he fought&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>and conquered this dreadful Fish in the presence of&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>several ships' crews, followed it to the shore, ripped&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  <br>open its bowels, recovered the part of his friend's&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  <br>body which the rapacious creature had swallowed,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  <br>and had it decently interred with the other half that&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>was taken up by his shipmates in the boat.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  IN order to prepare every reader for the very curious and entertaining anecdote,<br>which we are now going to lay before him, we must state, that the shark is a fish<br>well known both in the northern and southern seas for its ravenous nature, preying<br>upon most animals that come in its way.<p>These creatures are sometimes seen very numerous among the ships in Carusle<br>Bay at Barbadoes, especially when there were many vessels with slaves from Guinea,<br>before the abolition of that inhaman traffic, for some hundreds of these wretches<br>being often crowded together in one bottom, a vast number of them [&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;]ed with various<br>diseases: and being thrown overboard, brought together so great a multitude of these<br>voracious animals, that it was not safe, at such times, for the fatigued sailors to re-<br>fresh themselves by bathing in the bay.<p>It was here that one of these during and profitable adventurers of the deep per-<br>formed so memorable an achievement in the destruction of a shark, that, when the<br>principle which prompted him to go very unequal and hazardous a combat, and the<br>intrepidity of the action itself are considered, abstractedly from the low and mean<br>circumstances of the person, who was but a common sailor, it will perhaps appear to<br>be as heroic an instance of disinterested friendship, and personal bravery, as any re-<br>corded in history.<p>Some time ago Captain John Beams, commander of the York merchant, arrived at<br>Barbadoes from England. Having disembarked the last part of his loading, which<br>was coals, the sailers, who had been employed in that dirty work, ventured into the<br>sea to wash themselves.<p> There they had not been long before a person on board espied a large shark mak-<br>ing towards them, and gave notice of their danger, upon which they swam back and<br>reached the boat, all but one.<p>  Him the monster overtook almost within reach of the oars, and gripping him by<br>the small of the back, his devouring jaws soon cut him asunder, and as soon swallow-<br>ed the lower part of his body. The remaning part was taken up and carried on<br>board where his comrade was.<p> His friendship with the deceased had long been distinguished, by a reciprocal dis-<br>charge of all such endearing offices as imploed an union and sympathy of souls.<br>When he saw the severed trank of his friend, is was with horror and emotion too<br>great for words to paint.<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  During this affecting scene, the insatiable shark was seen traversing the bloody<br>surface in search after the remainder of his prey. The rest of the crew thought<br>themselves happy at being on board; he alone was unhappy, that he was not within<br>reach of the destroyer.<p>Fired at the sight. and vowing that he would make the devourer disgorge, or be<br>swallowed himself into the same grave, he plunges into the deep, armed with a large<br>sharp pointed knife. The shark no sooner saw him, but he made furiously towards<br>him.<p>Both eqaully eager, the one of his prey, the other of revenge : the moment the<br>shark opened his rapacious jaws, his adversary dexterously dived, and grasping him<br>with his left hand somewhat below the upper fins, successfully employs his knife in<br>his right hand, giving him repeated stabs in the belly.<p>The enraged shark, after many unavailing efforts, finding himself overmatched in<br>his own element, endeavours to disengage himself, sometimes plunging to the bottom,<br>then, mad with pam, rearing his uncouth form (now stained with his own streaming<br>blood) above the foaming waves.<p> The crews of the surrounding vessels saw the unequal conflict, uncertain from<br>which of the combatants the streams of blood issued ; till at length the shark, much<br>weakened by the loss of blood, made towards shore, and with him his conqueror,<br>who, flushed with assurance of victory, pushes his foe with redoubled ardour, and,<br>by the help of an ebbing tide, dragging him on shore, rips up his bowels, and unites <br>and buries the severed body of his friend in one hospitable grave.<p>  The story, I confess, (says the author) is of so extraordinary a nature, that I should<br>not have dared to give it to the public, had not I been authorised thereto by the tes-<br>timony of a very credible gentleman, who is ready to confirm by oath the truth of&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>what is here related.<p>  This action, intrepid as it is, will unquestionably fall under the censure of those<br>who are accustomed to judge by the rules of moral or political fitness; it not being<br>prudent for any man to expose himself to a danger, from which he must owe his es-<br>cape as much to chance as to valour, nor consistent with the valour which ough  to<br>be set on the great gift of life, to risque it, at any time, on small and inadequate oc-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>casions.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <p>The exploit, therefore, had been more truly heroic, had it been performed for the&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  <br>preservation of his friend's life, rather than the recovery of his body; but such re-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  <br>flections are not the sentiments of sailors?a class of men to whom courage is a vir- <br>tue, however madly or unreasonably exerted : and yet if such an action had been<br>recorded of Scipio or Alexander, in the defence of Lælius or Hephestion, would it<br>not have been celebrated by their admirers among the most shining and most mag-<br>nanimous atchievement of those renouned heroes and friends.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  <p>Edinburgh, Printed for the Booksellers , Price  ONE PENNY.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
