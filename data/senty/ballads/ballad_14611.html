	<p> SECOND EDITION.<p>AND COW'S ACCOUNT TO BAILIE HAIG  ON THE<p>SCAFFOLD.<p>EXECUTION<p><p>Full, true and Correct&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Account of the Execu-<br>tion of James Gow, shoemaker, residing in Bull's<br>Turnpike Stair,  High Street,  and  Thomas  Be-<br>veridge,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;blacksmith,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; residing&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;in&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Little&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jack's<br>Close,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Canongate, who  was executed this day.<br>the 2d of December, for the cruel and  bloody<br>murder of their wives ; also an account of the<br>way in which those diabolical murderers com-<br>mitted the attrocious deeds.<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<p>This day, Thomas Beveridge, blacksmith, lately residing<br>in Little Jack's Close, Canongate and James Cow, shoe<br>maker, lately residing in Bull's Turnpike Stair, High Street,<br>underwent the extreme penalty of the law at the head of<br>Libberton's Wynd, this morning, for the cruel and unnatural<br>murder of their wives.<p>As usual, on such occasions, a great concourse of people<br>were assembled, as great if not greater than on any other<br>several occasions, probably from the novelty to two men being<br>both brought to the scaffold at one time for the taking the<br>lives of their wives.<p>Beveridge, who our readers  will  recollect, was convinced<br>of having maltreated his wife, Janet with a poker, a shovel<br>and a knife, in&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;their  own house, on Sunday evening&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the<br>2d of October,  which  caused  her death the same evening<br>This unfortunate culprit  has  left  three  children&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to mourn<br>his uutimely fate ; the eldest  is a girl only about 7 years of<br>age. Since his condemnation he has been extremely penitent,<br>after he received sentence he&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;was taken&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to the  Lock up<br>House, to wait the  arrival of the  caravan, to convey them<br>to the Jail.<p>Beveridge was convicted on the evidence of a number of<br>witnesses, and James Gray, who is a decent looking trade-<br>man, was charged with prevarication, and attempting to con<br>ceal the truth, as an example to others, the Lord Justice<br>Clerk, after admonishing Gray, sentenced him to 3 callender<br>months in Jail,<p>Since the confinement of those unfortunate culprit, their<br>behaviour has been  becoming to  their awful and miserable<br>situation, in which they are  placed, through  the most cra[ ]<br>and bad conduct towards their wives.<p>Gow, after he received his sentence, and in the Lock up<br>House, he addressed the turnkey, the game is up, all is over,<br>after a short time he stated to his fellow prisoners that his<br>wife has put on a iron ring on his leg, but he put a gold<br>ring on her finger.<p>James Gow was a native of Dalkeith,, but has resided in Edinbargh a<br>number of years. Thomas Beveridge is a  native of Kirkcaldy. and gaafe<br>to Edinburgh in search of work some years ago,<p>About a quarter past  eight the mournful procession moved towards the<br>Head of Libberton's Wynd. the culprits  appeared to be very penitent.  Be-<br>veridge appeared  to be very  weak,  but both with a firm step, they  were<br>both attended to the place of execution by the Clergymen.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  Both joined<br>prayar most servently,and singed a psalm, both acknowledged the justness<br>of their sentence.Gow  step'd forward&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bailie  Haig, and said&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;none<br>could regret his awful situation more than he, if wives  were  to keep home<br>and make the houses  of their  husbands  more agreeable, such  things never<br>could occur ;  he hoped his  honour would make this  public, as  a caution<br>all; the sure way to make a good  husband, is so be a good  wife.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  He died<br>in peace with&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;all&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;men, and  both acknowledged the again justness  of their<br>sentence, and died  in peace with all men.<p>After being tied up with the halter about their neck, and night caps put<br>over their eyes the unhappy men shook hands, Gow exclamed and with<br>an audible voice, Lord have mercy on our souls, Lord receive our soul.<br>the handkerchief was then drops, and they were launched into eternity.<br>neither struggled much.<p>FORBES & Co. Printers, 171, Cowgate&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <p></p>
