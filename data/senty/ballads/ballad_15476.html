	<p> Trial and Sentence !<p>A Full and Particular Account of the Trial and Sen-<br>tence of WILLIAM  POLLOCK, who is to be Executed<br>at Edinburgh, on Wednesday the 22d March, 1826,<br>for the awful Murder of his Wife, on the 11th No-<br>vember last, at Gifford's Park, and his Body to be<br>given to Dr Munro for Dissection.<p>YESTERDAY morning, Monday the 13th February, 1826, came<br>on, before the High Court of Justiciary, the Trial of WIL-<br>LIAM POLLOCK, accused of Murdering, on the evening of the<br>llth November last, Ann Rennie, his wife, in his own house in<br>Gifford's Park, near Edinburgh, by giving her a stab in the lower<br>part of the body, with a knife or some lethal weapon, in conse-<br>quence of which she died shortly after. The circumstances of this<br>case, though of a peculiarly interesting nature, cannot with pro-<br>priety be published. They may however be shortly stated thus,?<br>Pollock and the deceased had been married for upwards of twenty<br>years, and had four children in life, and one dead. For a consider-<br>able time past they had lived on the worst terms,...the wife being<br>much addicted to drinking, and while in a state of intoxication ex-<br>ceedingly quarrelsome ; consequently brawls frequently occurred<br>in the house, and Mrs Pollock was on some of these occasions<br>struck. On the night previous to her decease, Mrs Pollock ap-<br>peared melancholy, and said she would rather sleep in a stair than<br>go home, she was so much afraid of her husband. She did how-<br>ever venture home, much the worse of liquor. About midnight<br>the pannel called a neighbour (Mrs Leishman) to come and see his<br>wife, then dead. This witness described the situation of the body,<br>and appearance of the room, with accuracy and minuteness ;? her<br>evidence was fully corroborated. To Mrs Leishman the pannel<br>stated that his wife had died in consequence of the rupture of a<br>blood-vessel. A child of five years of age, however, said at the<br>time, " Daddy kicked and hurted my mammy ;" upon which Pol-<br>lock threatened the boy, who became afraid.<p>Pollock, at the desire of Mrs Leishman, went for Dr White ; and<br>while on his way to his own house, he stated to that gentleman,<br>that he thought his wife's death had been occasioned by her up-<br>setting a table on which had been some earthenware, and then fall-<br>ing on the fragments in the floor,?but at the period of this con-<br>versation it was not ascertained the deceased had been wounded at<br>all. Dr While examined the body for nearly twenty minutes be-<br>fore he discovered the wound, which, he said, must have been in-<br>flicted by a sharp instrument, and could not be received in a fall.<br>The evidence and conclusions of Dr White were fully borne out by<br>Mr Newbigging and Mr Black of the police establishment, all con-<br>curring that the death could not, by possibility, have happened by<br>the hand of the deceased herself, nor from accident.<p>An attempt was made, on the part of Pollock, to make out that<br>the deceased, from her disposition, might have received the wound<br>from some person with whom she had quarrelled.<p>The Jury were addressed with much feeling by the Lord Advo-<br>cate, and by Adam Paterson, Esq. in a speech of considerable in-<br>genuity and talent for the pannel.<p>The Lord Justice Clerk then delivered an impressive charge to<br>the Jury, who, without leaving the box, unanimously found the<br>prisoner guilty....Sentence was delayed till this day at two o'clock.<p>Accordingly this day, Tuesday, the Court met at two o'clock,<br>when the Jury was called over; and after the Lords had  delivered<br>their opinion, the Lord Justice Clerk, in a most solemn and im-<br>pressive manner, addressed the prisoner at considerable length, ex-<br>patiating on the horrible enormity of his offence, murder being<br>equally repugnant to the laws of God and man, and aggravated<br>particularly in his case, in having been committed on the body of a<br>person he was solemnly bound to protect by every law, human and<br>divine. His Lordship then pronounced the awful sentence of the .<br>law, That he be detained in Jail, and fed on bread and water, till<br>Wednesday the 22d day of March next, and to be then taken to<br>the head of Libberton Wynd, between the hours of 8 and 10<br>o'clock morning, and there hanged till he be dead, and his body af-<br>terwards delivered to be publicly dissected.<p>Edinburgh,....Printed for the Booksellers.?Price One Penny.</p>
