	<p> As Account of the Trial and Sentence of MARGARET<br>KENNEDY, who was Tried before the Circuit Court of<br>Justiciary, at Glasgow, on Thursday last, the 1st of Octo-<br>ber 1818, and Condemned to be Executed there, on Wed-<br>nesday the 4th of November next, for passing Forged<br>Guinea Notes of the Stirling Banking Company, knowing<br>them to be such.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  <p>AT Glasgow, on Thursday the 1st October, the Circuit Court of Justi-<br>ciary proceeded to the Trial of MARGARET KENNEDY, accused of<br>passing forged Guinea Notes of the Stirling Banking Company, on the 23d of<br>June last, in the Shops of John Clark, victualler, 85, Stqckwell; William<br>Thomson, ditto, ditto ; James Cuthbert, spirit dealer, Bridge-gate ; Stewart<br>Mitchell, tobacconist, 47, King Street; and Alexander Morison, grocer, ditto ;<br>where  she was detected, and, being shortly thereafter apprehended, did privily<br>drop two others of the said forged notes ; and there was found upon her per-<br>son five genuine bank notes of One Pound each, and some silver and copper.<br>Her purchases in these shops were generally below the value of a shilling,<br>that she might the more readily obtain change; by getting a One Pound Note<br>and the small purchase for her forged Guinea Note. The Pannel pleaded<br>Not Guilty.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <p>Ebenezer Connal has been twelve years acting as clerk to the Stirling Bank<br>at Stirling ; the notes of the Company are payable to witness, and his name<br>is always written on the notes by himself. Mr Eadie, late cashier, also, while<br>he was cashier, put his name to the notes. James M'Ewan, who enters them,<br>put his name to them likewise; seven of the notes described in the indictment<br>were shown to the witness, who swore that all of them were cast from a<br>forged plate, and that all the names on them were also fabricated. John Tel-<br>ford, the present cashier, corroborated the above evidence. James Eadie, re-<br>siding in Stirling, was cashier to the Stirling Bank for six years prior to Mar-<br>tinmas last. He corroborated the evidence of Messrs Connal and Telford as<br>to the forgery of the notes, and added, that the Bank had no notes bearing the<br>dates or numbers of those exhibited.<p>Margaret Thomson, wife of William Thomson, victualler, Stockwell, recol-<br>lects the prisoner coming into her shop on a Tuesday in June last, to purchase<br> ed worth of oat-meal cakes.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She tendered a guinea note of the Stirling<br>Bank.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Alexander Brownlie and Duncan Morison were in the shop at the<br>time, and the witness gave the note to Brownlie, who suspected it to be bad,<br>and the prisoner exclaimed, " What, have they given my husband a bad note<br>payment of his wages ?'&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The pannel did not appear at all alarmed when<br>Brownlie asserted the note was forged, but appeared perfectly calm.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Brown-<br>lie, however, on consulting with Morison, changed the note, and put it into<br>is pocket.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Alex. Brownlie, College Street, and D. Morison, collector of dues<br>at the Old Bridge, corroborated the testimony of the preceding witness, in re-<br>lation to the vending the forged note in Thomson's shop in June last, and<br>identified the woman.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Brownlie put his initials on the note, which he lodged<br>a the Police Office, and the note now produced is the same.<p>Catharine Cuthbert, keeper of her brother's spirit cellar, Bridgegate street,<br>remembers three women last summer coming to the shop for spirits; the pri-<br>soner called for the spirits, and tendered a guinea note of the Stirling Bank,<br>when witness gave her a pound note in change ; was suspicious of the note,<br>and shewed it to a gentleman next door, who said there were no bad ones go-<br>ing, and it was a good one; he came back about eight o'clock asking if she had<br>kept the note, for he had heard there was a woman apprehended on suspicion,<br>and carried to the Police Office ; she went there, took the note with her, and<br>saw the prisoner ; wrote her name on the back of it, and is perfectly sure the<br>note she got from the pannel is the same she put her name on, and that now<br>shown in Court is the same.------D. Fraser, police-officer, apprehended the pri-<br>soner, in June in Morison's shop, King street, uttering forged notes ; there<br>were two guinea notes of the Stirling Bank at her feet, and five genuine notes<br>found in her breast; put his initials on the notes in the Police Office, and those<br>now shown him are the same.---- D. Naismith, son of D. Naismith, victual-<br>ler, King street, and D. Cameron, police serjeant, corroborated this evidence.<p>The prisoner's declaration was then read, that she was 22 years of age, and<br>that she had got the notes from some Irishmen, near St Ninian's, to whom she<br>sold smuggled Highland whisky, and had a still going at the time she was ta-<br>ken ; her husband died about two years ago, and she has had no fixed place<br>of residence since; that she came to Glasgow on private business with a cler-<br>gyman, and on purpose to purchase a still, &c.<p>The Depute-Advocate addressed the Jury for the Crown, and Mr Grahame<br>for the Prisoner. Lord Gillies summed up the evidence, and directed the at-<br>tention of the Jury to the great body of legal proof adduced against the Pri-<br>soner, which he thought perfectly sufficient to warrant them to bring in a ver-<br>dict of guilty. The Jury returned a verdict, all in one voice, finding the pan-<br>nel Guilty of uttering the two forged notes specified in the 2d and 3d charges,<br>knowing them to be forged ; but, on account of her want of education and<br>general ignorance, unanimously recommended her to mercy. After which,<br>she was sentenced to be Executed on Wednesday the 4th November; the un-<br>fortunate woman was much agitated, and wept bitterly on hearing her sentence.<p>Printed in Edinburgh:?Price ONE PENNY.</p>
