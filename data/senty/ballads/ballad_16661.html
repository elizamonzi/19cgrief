	<p> THE LAST DYING WORDS, SPEECH, & CONFESSION<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; OF&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <p>ELIZABETH WARRINER. <p>Who was Convicted at the last  Lincoln Assizes, for the Horrid Mur-<br>der of her Step-Son, J. Warriner, by poison, and who was Exe-<br>cuted at the City of Linclon, an Saturday the 27th of Oct 1821.<p>ELIZABETH WARRINER was indicted for the Murder of J. Warriner, her Step-Son,<br> at Surfleet, by administering poison to him. The prisoner was the second wife of a<br>Farmer. The deceased was his Son by a former marriage, about 12 years of age. From<br>the period of her marriage, the prisoner treated the child with great cruelty On various<br>occasions she was heard to say she would be the death of him. At length on the morning<br>stated in the indictment, the boy, immediately after breakfast, which consisted of bread and<br>milk, was taken ill. Medical aid was called in, but he breathed his last in the course of the<br>day. After she had poisoned the unfortunate boy, she dragged him out of the house, and<br>put him in the stable, and hanged him up, with a rope round his neck, to make people be-<br>lieve he had hung himself, as there was no marks of violence round the neck. The body<br>was opened by a surgeon, when the stomach and intestines were found to exhibit all the ap-<br>pearance of arsenic having been administered. It was afterwards ascertained that a quan-<p>\ill\  of arsenic was in the possession of the father, who used it for some husbandry purpose,<p>\ill\ which the prisoner had access.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It further turned out, that a small quantity was found<br>\ill\ he basin from which he had eaten his breakfast: and that the prisoner had given him his<br>\ill\ kfast in that basin.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This on circumstance, added to a variety&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of others, which is the<br>\ill\ se of the examination of the witnesses, seven in numher, came out, led to to the conclu-<br> \ill\  that the prisoner administered the poison.<p> Mr. Justice Holroyd summed up tne evidence, and the Jury found her gulity, The<br>\ill\ in passing sentence, obserted to the prisoner, that the crime of murder in all cases<br>\ill\ an heinous one, and in all countries was punished with death; but there were gradations<br>\ill\ in this crime, and her's was of the worst nature. She had destroyed her Step-Son; and<br>no other motive could be assigned than that arising from a cruel, hardened, and vicious dis-<br>position-her crime was that of muder, the most heinous and cruel.-He hoped she would<br>sincerely repent of her crime, and take all possible care of her soul during the few hours she<br>had to live, so to be reconciled to her offended Maker; he feared she was not so convinced<br>of the necessity of this as she ought to be, but trusted she would seek for that advice which<br>would satisfy her of that necessity, and enable her to meet her future Judge, with a well-<br>rounded hope in his mercy from the sincerity of her contrition; all that remained for him to<br>do was to pass sentence upon her which the law required, which was, that she should be<br>taken from whence she came, and  on Saturday the 27th October, 1821, to be taken from<br>thence, to the place of execution, there to be hanged by the neck till she was dead, and that<br>her body should be delivered to the surgeons for dissection-concluding with- "and may<br>the Lord have  mercy on your soul "<p>The moment she heard that her life was to be forfeited for the barbarous murder, and her<br>cruel treatment to her Step-Son, she jumped up from the floor in the greatest agony, wring-<br>ing her hands, and other symptoms of distraction.<p>About ten o'clock on Saturday morning, she ascended the fatal scaffold with a greater de-<br>gree of fortitude and resignation than could have been expected; and addressed the numer-<p>ous spectators around her in nearly the following words;  "Good people, you see now be-<br>fore you an unfortunate woman, cut off just in the prime of life, and for the most dreadful of<br>al crimes, Murder! let my dreadful fate be a warning to you not to suffer your passion to<br>work forcibly on your minds, which has been the cause of the melancholy situation in which<br>I am now placed; let me beg your prayers- good people pray for me; O pray for me."<p>On the morning  of her awful execution, she was dressed all in white, with a child suckling<br>at her breast, which was taken from her by the executioner  and her melancholy cries was<br>heard at a great distance. It was shocking to the surrounding multitude.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<p>She then dropped a handkerchief she held in her hand, as a signal, crying, O my Child! my<br>Child ! and was immediately launched into a dreadful eternity.<p>printed by John Muir, Glasgow.</p>
