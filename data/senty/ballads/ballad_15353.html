	<h2>Transcription</h2>
	<p> Execution.<p>An account of the execution  of James&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wilson and<br> John M'Donald, at Glasgow,  on Wednesday the<br>4th day of June. 1823 ; with their behaviour in<br>Jail, and on the Scaffold.<p>Glasgow, June 5th, 1823.<p>Yesterday, Wednesday, 4th June, were Executed pursuant to their<br>sentence, James Wilson for Housebreaking and Robbery, and<br>John M'Donald for breaking into a Jeweller's Shop in Glasgow,<br>and stealing therefrom a quantity of gold and silver watches, &c.<p>Since their condemnation the have behaved in a very exem-<br>p'ary manner. They had some faint hopes of receiving a com-<br>mutation of punishment, more especially Wilson, but the magis-<br>trates having received the warrant for their Exctution, and com-<br>municate I the contents to the prisoners, entirely dispelled their<br>most sanguine hopes ; they received the information with aston-<br>ishing resignation, and a great chauge was easily observed in their<br>manner; having had hopes of a reprieve, their minds were kept<br>in a fluctuating and uncertain state, but now that those anticipa-<br>tions were for ever blasted, every earthly care was obliterated, and<br>they became earnestly solicitous for an interest in that Way by<br>which alone they could hope for felicity in an eternal world.<br>They received joyfully and with a becoming countenance the cler-<br>gymen, and other individuals who visied them for the purpose<br>of instruction. Their friends visited them on the Sunday previous<br>to the Execution, to take a last farewell of the unhappy men ; the<br>scenc was most affecting; the hardest heaat present must have<br>yielded to the impulse of nature. They slept very little on Tues-<br>day night, and the clergymen found them ready to receive them<br>on Wednesday, and they continued with them all the forenoon.<p>About 2 o'clock they were taken from their cells to the court-<br>room where the magistrates were assembled, and an excellent<br>prayer was put up by one of the clergymen the doleful proces-<br>sion then moved forward to the Scaffold in front of the jail and<br>court-house; an immense crowd of spectators were present; the<br>unfortunate men took no heed to what was going on around them,<br>but appeared to listen attentively to the words of the clergymen.<br>After most impressive supplications to the throne of grace for the<br>unhappy prisoners, and part of a psalm sung, in which they were<br>heard distinctly to join, they ascended the drop, and while the<br>Executioner was adjusting, their hands were observed  moving as<br>engaged in fervent prayer. The Executioner shoook hands with<br>them, and scarcely had he descended from the drop, when the<br>fatal signal was given, and these unfortunate men were launch-<br>ed into eternity. Macdonald seemed to die easily, but Wilson<br>had one or two heavy convulsions, after being about a minute<br>hanging.<p><p>They were both stout young meu a number of their former<br>associates were among the crowd, and they seemed to be deep-<br>ly affected with the fate of their companions. May the awful<br>and appaling spectacle be a warning to them and all who were<br>present, to move in that sphere which subjects them not to the<br>just though rigorous laws of their country.</p>
