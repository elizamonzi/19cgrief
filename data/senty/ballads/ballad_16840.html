	<p> THE DANDY SERVANTS<p><p>Ye braw decenent women I'll sing you a song,<br>Of the wit of the auld and the pride of the young,<br>They are all grown sae gaudy as sure as my life,<br>Ye' ll hardly ken servant frae the guidwife.<br>Down down, hey derry down.<p>It's not of farmers' daughters nor tradesmen's indeed,<br>In  Which I intend to sing my new creed.<br>It's of servant lasses that are getting sae braw,<br>That they outstrip their mistress far and awa.<p>There is some exceptions I must confess,<br>I mean in behaviour not in their dress,<br>For they dress all alike, and like dandies they go,<br>And some of them decent and some of them no.<p>Between six and seven the miss goes to school,<br>Before she knows whether she's wise or a fool,<br>There she learns to count and to write,<br>Till she's fit for a lawyer or something such like.<p>When schooling is over to service she goes,<br>And then for high wages as you may suppose,<br>The first of it goes for a white muslin gown,<br>And a bonnet that would keep moonlight from the town.<p>And down the bonnet there hangs a bit silk,<br>Which old granny had serving her milk,<br>I own it was useful her beauty to trace,<br>For it hid all the wrinkles that was in her face.<p>She then decks herself like a ship in full sail,<br>. The ribbons as broad as the green leaves o' kail,<br>With that and the veil hanging over her e'en,<br>That there's not a wrinkle at all to be seen.<p>She curls up her hair like water-dogs tail,<br>Ro' ll up in paper as round as a snail,<br>The very first Sunday the veil goes on,<br>One says to to the other who is she yon ?<p>Then on Sunday she goes to the church,<br>But what she hears there she does not mind much ;<br>Neither the text nor the psalm will she mind on,<br>But she'll mind very well what he neighbours had on.<p>At balls and at meetings she will rant and rove,<br>And every new meeting shall gel a new love,<br>But with her gallanting ere three years go round,<br>Her state alters suddenly her bonnet goes down.<p>Syne after they're married away the child goes,<br>And leaves the poor creature in sorrow and woe,<br>And away to America then he does trip,<br>And leaves the poor miss the shaft to lick.<p>Then she's confined like a cow to the grass,<br>And bonnet laid down with the gown, veil and dress ;<br>The cradle she rooks while the wean it does roar,<br>And she grievesat the thine that she laughed at before.</p>
