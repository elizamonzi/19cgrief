	<p> UP IN A<p>BALLOON.<p>Sec. 28.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Music at Hopwood and Crew's.<p>One night I went up in a balloon,<p>On a voyage of discovery?to visit the moon,<p>Where an old man lives, so some people say-<p>" Through cutting of sticks on a Sunday,"<p>Up went the balloon quickly, higher and higher,<p>Over house-top and chimney-pot, tower and spire,<p>I knock'd off the Monument's top very high,<p>And caught hold of the cross of St. Paul's going by.<p>CHORUS.<p>Up in a balloon, up in a balloon,<p>All among  the little stars, sailing round the moon;<p>Up in a balloon, up in a balloon?<p>It's something awfully jolly to be up in a balloon.<p><p>Up, up I was borne with terrible power,<br>At the rate of ten thousand five hundred an hour ;<p>The air was cold, the wind blew loud-<p>I narrowly escaped being choked by a cloud;<br>Still up I went, till surrounded by stars,<br>And such planets as Jupiter, Venus, and Mars ;<br>The Big and the Little Bear loudly did growl,<br>And the Dog Star, on seeing me, set up a howl.<p><p>I met shooting stars who were bent upon sport,<p>But who " shot" in a very strange manner I thought;<p>And one thing beat all my chalks I must say,<p>That was when I got into the Milky Way,<p>I counted the stars, till at last I thought<p>I'd found out how much they were worth by the quart;<p>An unpolite "Aerolite," who ran' gainst my car,<p>Wouldn't give e'er a light to light my cigar !<p><p>Next a comet went by 'midst fire like hail,<br>To give me a lift I seized hold of his tail;<br>To where he was going I didn't enquire?<br>We'd gone past the moon till we couldn't get higher;<br>Yes wa'd got to the furthermost, don't think I joke,<br>When somehow I felt a great shock?I awoke !<br>When instead of balloon, moon, and planets, I saw<br>I'd tumbled from off my bed on to the floor!<p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And there was no balloon, there was no balloon,<p>There were not any planets, and there wasn't any moon;<p>So never sup too heavy, or by jingo very soon<p>You're like to fancy you are going up in a balloon !</p>
