	<p> A Full and Particular Account of that FATAL<br>ACCIDENT at Tarbet on Loch Lomond, on<br>Friday last, 29th August, 1828, by the upsetting<br>of a Boat, by which Eleven Lives were Lost!!!<p>Tarbet is a small hamlet on the western bank of Loch Lomond<br>and the steamers, in making the voyage up and down the lake, u-<br>sually stop there for a few minutes to land and take on board pes-<br>sengers. Between two and three o'clock on Friday the Lady of the<br>Lake, on her way down the Loch, arrived opposite the place, and<br>a small boat, with twenty-one persons on board, including the two<br>boatmen, instantly put off from the shore. The lake was as smooth<br>as glass, and the steamer only about thirty or forty yards from the<br>beach; but owing to the boat being heavily laden, and her equili-<br>brium exceedingly delicate, the unfortunate individuals on board<br>were naturally apprehensive of some disaster. A person, who was<br>standing on the beach, described the boat as " wabbling" on from<br>one side to the other, till it had nearly reached the steamer, when it<br>made a " creen" so alarming that a number of the passengers start-<br>ed up and clustered to the higher side, when she instantly heeled<br>over, and turned keel uppermost. So suddenly were the whole of<br>the unfortunates engulphed, that only one or two shrieks were heard<br>by the crowd on the deck of the steamer. Notwithstanding the con-<br>sternation which prevailed on board, a boat was promptly lowered,<br>and, with the assistance of one or two skiffs from the shore, it res-<br>cued a number of the drowning people. The first boat which put<br>off from the shore was launched by two women. They had no<br>oars, but one of them used a piece of plank as a substitute, and the<br>other her hands. One or two men rushed chin-deep into the water, in<br>order to tender their aid ; but not being swimmers, they nearly per-<br>ished, without being able to accomplish their humane objects. Nine<br>individuals, some says cleven, out of the twenty, perished. Several<br>of those who escaped reached the shore by swimming. One stout<br>swimmer, at the moment the boat threw out her cargo, found three<br>partners in peril clinging to the skirts of his coat. A seaman be-<br>longing to the Leven, who happened to be on board the Lady of the<br>Lake, and who was instrumental in saving four lives, stated that<br>the boat came roughly against the steamer, which occasioned it to<br>dip quite to its gunwale, and thereby induced the incautious move-<br>ment among the passengers which led to the fatal catastrophe. The<br>lake deepens very abrubtly at this part, and is nearly five fathoms<br>water where the accident took place. It is worthy of remark, that<br>the unlucky boat righted very soon after proving so faithless to her<br>trust. Some of who were picked up by the boats before life was<br>extinct, were with diffculty resuscitated, though every exertion was<br>made that circumstances, and medical aid promptly procured, al-<br>lowed. The most laudable efforts were also made to recover those<br>in whom the spark of life was for ever extinguished. Their clothes<br>were instantly cut off them, and their bodies were swathed in warm<br>blankets and laid out in the heat of the sun, where they were rub-<br>bed with spirits and salt. Some of them were bled, and attempts<br>made to inflate their lungs with bellows These exertions were<br>continued while the smallest .hope of resuscitation remained.<p>The Reverend Mr Proudfoot, minister of Arrochar, in a letter<br>dated the day on which the accident happened, enumerates the fol-<br>lowing sufferers : -Andrew M'Farlane, wright in Tarbet, who has<br>left a widow and three children to lament his loss....William Brown,<br>boatman, (unmarried)...John Brock, a fine young boy....A widow<br>lady, name unknown, but whose son was along with her, but e-<br>scaped...A gentleman, with blue coat, gilt buttons, black collar,<br>black vest, and brown trowsers?money, 12s. 3d.; a brass mount-<br>ed penknife, brass pencil case.
