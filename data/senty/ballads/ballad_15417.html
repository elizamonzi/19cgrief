	<p> LORD NICHOLSON,<p>FOR <p>ONE NIGHT ONLY,<p>WILL HOLD A COURT<p>In, the Music Hall, George Street,<p>ON WEDNESDAY, OCT. 4, 1848.<p>LORDS BROUGHAM AND  NICHOLSON.<p>Comparo Virgilium cum Homero.<p>IT is agreed in all times that wits are privileged to--- wear what masks they please.<br>Ihis impunity has no doubt operated upon the minds of the distinguished individuals, whose<br>comparative characters we are about to submit to critical analysis. The unscrupulous<br>masquerading of these learned lords may fairly provoke a publicity of animadversion, which<br>composure of character and dignified retirement would disarm.<p>Brougham commenced his public carreer as a writer for the periodical press ; so did<br>Nicholson. Nicholson's practice was almost exclusively confined to side bar applications?<br>motions of course; Brougham's practice, although of more exalted pretensions, was not, in a<br>pecuniary sense, much larger. He was seldom retained for a plaintiff', and in the great<br>commercial cases he was invariably rejected,?Campbell, Scarlet, Gurney, Marryat, Best,<br>cum multis aliis, being preferred by solicitors intrusted with such interests. This policy was<br>construed by Brougham into neglect and insult, and there can be no doubt that it originated<br>the morbid antipathy against attornies, so frequently exhibited as an uncontrollable passion<br>by the noble lord in after life and power.<p>Nicholson, after a flourishing career at the bar, raised himself to the dignity of Chief<br>Baron, without filling the usual probationary offices of either Attorney or Solicitor-General.<br>Brougham assumed the office of Lord High Chancellor under precisely similar circumstances,<br>which might be remarked, " in equity," was neither fair nor advantageous. Brougham,<br>while Chancellor, played the mountebank by going like an itinerant showman from town to<br>town, dining, drinking, making speeches, and exhibiting himself at small cost to the multi-<br>tude, to the great scandal of his high office and exalted profession. Nicholson, soon after<br>his elevation, did the same thing. He, like his brother Brougham, was ushered into towns<br>and cities by bellman and placard. Both exhibitions were incompatible with forensic dignity<br>and the exalted position of the parties. Brougham, for the last few years, has identified him-<br>self with certain coteries of purple hosiery, who walk behind society, viz. at the back, and with<br>an excusable though overweening vanity, consider themselves before and above it. There is a<br>fable of "The Syrens on the charmed island,'' who by the sweetness of their music allured un-<br>thinking mariners to destruction." The coterie are the orchestral Syrens?Brougham the infa-<br>tuated Jack Tar. Nicholson has of late mixed himself up with des bas coleur de rose, and revels<br>in a lecture-room with poses plastiques, dressed in pink silks, and (as he himself somewhat<br>indefinitely describes it) draperies scrupulously arranged. Were ever two legal lords so equi-<br>vocally employed ! It has been said of Brougham, that he has lectured princes and instructed<br>the mechanic. Nicholson's audiences are certainly of a mixed class. Brougham is on terms<br>of intimacy with the sporting nobility: so is Nicholson. Brougham is fond of entertaining<br>distinguished visitors : Nicholson's talents and efforts are exercised to the same end. In<br>their speeches and literature they likewise resemble each other in a material point, viz., their<br>partiality for Latin quotations. Lord Brougham seldom makes a speech without the intro-<br>duction of Greek or Latin : Lord Nicholson never charges a jury without " great goes " of<br>Latin, and we have heard him quote HEBREW. A rich vein of humour characterises the<br>whole of Brougham's proceedings : the same feature is prominent in Nicholson. There is a<br>QUASI humour about his gravity which is irresistibly comic, and without Brougham's advan-<br>tage of pantomimic proboscis. In their favourite drinks there is but small difference, Brougham<br>patronising calidum cum, Nicholson, frigidumsine. Nicholson is never invited to the palace :<br>nor is Brougham. Nicholson smokes in court?a most unusual thing : Brougham does not<br>go so far as that; but we have observed him on board a steamer, quietly smoking along with<br>the funnel.<p>In satire Brougham is a second Juvenal, and Nicholson a second Brougham.<p>To those who are not in daily intercourse with the world, and have not by its friction been<br>sand-papered into scrutiny of its comparative eccentricities, our remarks may not be con-<br>vincing ; to such we say, observe for yourselves. You have heard of two faces under one<br>hat. These are two men under one vizard, "par nobile fratrum."?Liverpool Chronicle,<br>Oct. 17, 1846.<p>Doors open at 8?The Court will sit at Half-past 8 o'clock.<p>Admission?Body of the Hall, 3s.; Sides and Under the Gallery, 2s ;<p>Gallery, 1s.<p>James Brydone, Printer, 17 South Hanover Street,</p>
