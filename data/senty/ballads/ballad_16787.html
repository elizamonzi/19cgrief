	<p>   A DAY WI'&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;THE&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; RABBITS <p>AT WEST PRESTON, KIRKBEAN.<p>A Blackbird, a Craw, a Swan, and a Lamb<br>Ae day wi' the Forrester met on the Sands ;<br>Says the yin to the ither, " the rabbits are thrang ;<br>" Could we no' get a day to gie them a bang ?"<p>So it was agreed to the Forrest to gang,<br>To talk owre the matter and ha' a bit dram ;<br>The Blackie he sang and the Swan he did swear,<br>They'd shoot any two for a fiver or mair.<p>The day it was fixed and duly came roun',<br>But, oh, what a day !?rain and snaw baith came doon ;<br>But this didna stop them, they out with their guns,<br>And in wi' the ferrits to a' likely runs;<p>The Blackie and Swan gaed awa' by the Mills,<br>The Lamb and the Craw gaed wi' Bob to the Hills ;<br>The Forrester wi' Pears gaed down the Burnside,<br>Wi' the Wyllie auld fox to act as chief guide.<p>Out, out came the rabbits ; bang, bang went the guns ;<br>Then, Oh ! the loud laughter, and Oh ! the rare fun ;<br>To see the two Cracks could miss an old Buck?<br>Of course, no' bad shooting, but cursed bad luck.<p>They shot and they shot, till driven off by the rain,<br>Then they bethought them to count out the game ;<br>Each claimed his due share, some tried to claim more ;<br>Then came the swearing, and the Lamb was a " Bore."<p>When each had his say, came a sough frae the Mills,<br>The Blackie shot well, but the Swan had more kills ;<br>But Pears swore by a" things baith dead and alive,<br>That Forrester killed more than ony o' the five.<p>The Wyllie old fox held the cat's-----to the sun,<br>Then Pears swore the more by the Forrester's gun ;<p>He swore by the sun, the moon, and the day,<br>Bold Forrester had only let four away.<p>The Craw he was sick frae the night's-before drinking,<br>His hand wasna steady, his een were blink, blinking ;<br>But he swore it was only because o' his drought?<br>He'd shoot ony one of them for a' they were worth.<p>The Lamb, in his usual nice quiet style,<br>Said never a word till they got off their bile ;<br>When wee Robin Red Breast caused a great row<br>By swearing the Lamb let away only tow.<p>Then the Wyllie old fox thought it time to disperse,<br>And hoped soon to meet them again on the Merse ;<br>So after hand-shaking they a' left the Park,<br>Resolved to get home before it was dark.<p>The Lamb and the Swan both gaed the ae gaet,<br>Arrived duly home before it was late ;<br>The other three swore by the George they were dry,<br>So to quench their bit thirst they thought they would try.<p>And its rumoured about that when they sat down,<br>The talk it grew loud and the drink it flew roun';<br>That when they got up they were no' very steady,<br>But lucky for them it was dark in the city.<p>But this must be false, and untrue every line,<br>For the Blackie drinks only a wee drap o' wine ;<br>The Forrester sticks to auld Scotia's creation,<br>And the Craw he drinks only in due moderation.<p>So I canna believe that the rumour's correct,'<br>For we never would charge them wi' such like neglect;<br>But perhaps it is better the curtain should fall<br>On the fact they got home about half-past twal.</p>
