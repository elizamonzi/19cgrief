	<p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A true Narrative of the Transactions of&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  <p>IS A B E L L A  P E R S T O N,<p>Of Cambuslang, who is accused of Child-Murder, and now a Prisoner in the, Geal of<p>this City.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<p>THE public are ever anxious to hear<br>of the character of any unhappy<br>; wretch, who, by a wicked course of life,<br>becomes amenable to the law; but when<br>Murder happens to be the crime imputed,<br>curiosity becomes still greater; and from<br>the moment the law lays hold of the per-<br>son suspected, Rumour is ever ready to re-<br>late a thousand circumstances that perhaps<br>never happened.<p>Being fully aware that this is but too of-<br>ten the case, 'for the information of the<br>public, we think it highly proper to state<br>the following account of this unhappy<br>woman, who has now become so much the<br>subject of common conversation, which<br>was related to us by a person who resides<br>near the place where she lives, and may be<p> depended on as fact:-<p>ISARELLA  PERSTON, who is how con-<br>fined in the Tolbooth of Glasgow, being<br>accused of Child-Murder, is the daughter<br>of an industrious weaver, near Cambus-<br>lang, where, it is said, she committed the<br>horrid crime. <p>It appears, much to the distress of her<br>disconsolate Parents, that, for a long<br>time past, she has led a very irregular<br>life, despising  all advice, and indulging,<br>even to excess, those passions, which, When<br>not kept in due bounds, inevitably prove<br>the destruction of the weaker sex.<p>It seems she had connected herself with<br>a young man belonging to the above place,<br>with whom she has unlawfully cohabited<br>for many years past, in spite of every ef-<br>fort her poor, father made to make her<br>leave off her wicked practices, and regain<br>the Path of Virtue - a path, alas! to the<br>disgrace of this enlightened age, which is<br>too often forsaken.<p>By this man she has had five children,<br>two of whom died last year of the small-<br>pox; some indeed say she has had seven<br>illegitimate children, but as our informist<br>only knows of five, we are inclined, to<br>think that that is the number. <p>It was a circumstance so common to fee<br>her in a slate of pregnancy that the people<br>in the neighbourhood began to take little<br>notice of it; and indeed she became so ha<br>bituated to this sinful manner of life her-self, <br> as to treat with indifference whatever<br>was said to her reflecting it.<p>However, about two months ago, she<br>Was brought-to-bed, but not being seen as<br> usual with the fruits of her unlawful plea-<br>sure in her arms, the people about the<br>place began to make enquiry about what<br>might have Become of the child, testify-<br>ing, at the same time, their suspicions re-<br>specting its fate,<p>This passed On for some time, till seve-<br>ral religious people in the neighbourhood<br>thought proper to consider the report which<br>now began to prevail, That she had actu-<br>ally murdered the infant, in a more seri-<br>ous manner.<p>They at last concluded, that it was a du-<br>ty incumbent on them to enquire strictly<br>Into the fate of the little innocent, in or-<br>der, that if she had committed so detesta-<br>ble a crime, she might be apprended, and<br>brought to condign punishment.-<p>Having made up their minds in this re-<br>spect, they had her sent for, and after in-<br>terrogating her sharply respecting the in-<br>fant, she seemed disposed, at first, to give<br>no satisfactory answers to the questions<br>asked till at last they theatened touring<br>her before those that would compel her to<br>behave in another manner, she at last said.<br>That, being unable to earn her brea-<br>and take care of the child, she gave it in<br>charge to a beggar-woman, who faithful-<br>ly promised to call occasionally, and shew<br>the child.<p>This flimsy pretence, however, by no<br>means satisfied the people; therefore in-<br>formation was immediately lodged against<br>her, when she was apprehended, and safe-<br>ly conveyed to the goal of this city, where<br>in all pro remain, till her<br>fate is decided by a due course of law</p>
