	<p> BURKING SHOP<br>DESTROYED.<p>A particular Account of the Extraordinary Demolition of an Ana-<br>tomical Theatre, at Aberdeen, on Monday last, the 19th Decem-<br>ber 1831, which was Burnt and erazed to the ground, in conse-<br>quence of the sagacity of a Dog.<p>ON MONDAY, a few little boys, who were playing close<br>by a back court, observed a dog tearing up some substance<br>from the loose earth, gave the alarm, and, in a few minutes, 20 or<br>30 people were on the spot, when two lads finished what the dog<br>begun, and dug up a portion of the fragments of a human body,<br>when the crowd raised a shout of horror, and made for the doors<br>of the theatre. Two lads entered, and finding Mr Moir, the lectur-<br>er, in the place, assaulted him, turned him out and he escaped.<br>Part of the crowd, however, followed him to his own house, and in-<br>to a room, but Mr Moir leaped from a window, and escaped by<br>George's Street. The crowd, which had now increased to perhaps<br>a 100, rushed into the place, where they found three dead bodies<br>lying on boards. Cloaks, instruments, all the paraphernalia of the<br>place, instantly disappeared, part being destroyed, and part carried<br>0ff Information having been sent to the town-house, the officers<br>soon arrived at the place, and ordered the bodies to be taken out,<br>This was done, and when the mangled corpses were brought out to<br>the open air, and laid down on the ground, the loud yells of the<br>crowd, and their cries for revenge, baffile description. " Burn the<br>house....down with the burking shop!" was new the cry ; and<br>there being a fire in the place, the inmates tore down the plaster-<br>lath, and made every attempt to raise a fire, which they had, from<br>the want of materials, very great difficulty in accomplishing. Shav-<br>ings, fir, and tar-barrel staves, were, however, quickly obtained, and<br>great quantities of wood were brought and thrown in after the fire<br>had fairly taken effect. Cries of " Come out, come out, the house<br>is falling,"were now raised; and on going  to the back ground we<br>found that the crowd had commenced undermining the back wall<br>with large planks, one of which they used as a lever, and the other<br>as a battering-ram ; and go quickly did they do their work, that<br>within five minutes after they had commenced to undermine, the<br>whole of the back wall fell down with a tremendious crash. The<br>blaze of the fire was now extraordinary, from the quantity of sup-<br>plementary fuel put on. The crowd, however, did not appear to<br>rest satisfied until the- place was fazed. Accordingly, they carried<br>their planks to the street, and set so work with the front wall. At<br>this time, the Lord Provost and Magistrates, and a great number of<br>special constables arrived ; and his lordship proceeded with great<br>firmness through the crowd, whom he addressed several times, and<br>stated, that if the feelings of the public had been hurt in this case,<br>every enquiry would be made, and every satisfaction afforded .His<br>lordship was loudly cheered. In the meantime, a party of the 79th<br>regiment had been marched out of the barrack, but it was deemed<br>advisable to bring them no farther than Schoohill, from which they<br>entered into Gordon's Hospital, where they were stationed until the<br>end of the drama. About four o'clock a fire engine was brought ;<br>but it seems as if the crowd would not allow it to work?in fact,<br>no water could be had. In about an hour the front wall fell, leav-<br>ing only the two gables and the roof standing, which formed a great<br>burning arch. The scene which now opened upon the view of those<br>near the building was awfully sublime. Attacks were now made<br>upon the gables, and, after, a great deal of exertions, the two walls<br>and the roof fell together, amid the loud and continued cheers of<br>not less than 20,000 individuals. The crowd then began to retire,<br>although large portions of them still kept together ; and one division<br>having observed a student of medicine, as they were moving away,<br>they immediately pursued him, hooting and vociferating obnoxious<br>terms. The gentleman ran, and finding the mob gaining upon him,<br>he took refuge in a house in Schoolhill, which in a moment was<br>surrounded, and threatened to be demolished, unless the object of<br>their vengeance was turned out Crowds poured in from every<br>quarter, but it being understood that the student had escaped by a<br>back window, they began to disperse. Fart of them, however, fell<br>in with another student, whom they chased into the Guestrow; but<br>it appeared that he had doubled some corner and eluded their pur-<br>suit. They made a stand, however, before a house in Guestrow,<br>where bodies had formerly been discovered, and threatened its safe-<br>ty; but eventually dispersed, and by ten o'clock was perfectly quiet<p>Menzies, Printer, Edinburgh.?Price One Penny.</p>
