	<p>   Horrid  Murder<p>An Account of the Execution of Margaret Henderson,<br>an Interesting Young Woman of Eighteen years of<br>age, who was Executed at tke New Drop, London,<br>on Monday the 15th March 1824,for the Cruel and<br>Barbarous Murder of her male Bastard Child, by<br>Cutting its Throat, concealing it in her Bed room,<br>and afterwards Throwing its Mangled Body into the<br>Fire, where it was discovered nearly Burnt to Ashes,<br>by her fellow Servant, and her Body given for Dis-<br>section ; together with a very Affecting Letter<br>written to her Mother the night before her Execu-<br>tion.<p>OF all Murders that of a mother shedding the blood of her own<br>child is the most shocking. It is a matter of horror to re-<br>flect how human nature can be so debased; yet has duty often<br>tortured our feelings, in recording such abominable cases. To en-<br>deavour to amend the heart, and to deter others from crime, is the<br>account of our chronology, the very end of punishments.<p>Margaret Henderson was a native of the city of Durham, de-<br>scended from parents of repute, who having educated her in a very<br>decent manner, she went to London, and entered the service of a<br>genteel family. In a short time after she became acquainted with a<br>young man, and became pregnant, and committed the horrid mur-<br>der for which she suffered death. This unfortunate sufferer was<br>only 18 Years of age, and wrote the following verses under sen-<br>tence of death, as a caution to all young women.<p>Young lovers all, where'er you be,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>Draw near and listen awhile to me,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>You'll pity me when you hear my tele,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  <br> I write these verses in the gaol.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <p><br>In prison I am now confin'd,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  <br>With guilty heart and troubl'd mind,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  <br>For murder of the blackest dye,<br>My infant's blood for vengeance cry.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<p><p>The sixth commandment I have broke,  <br>O Lord, I fear thy vengeful stroke;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>We're told in scripture not to do so,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  <br>Murder and adultery thou shall not do.  <p><p>Margaret Henderson's mv name,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>I'm brought to scandal, grief & shame.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>By putting trust in a false young man,<br>Ne'er thinking be would me trepan. <p><p>We oft kept each others company,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>His discourse at first well pleased me,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  <br>BUt shortly I did plainly see,<br>Twas only a design on me.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<p><p>My sins are great I must confess,  <br>From time to time I did transgress,<br>To this young man I soon became a prey,<br> nd now I rest none night or day.<p> On the 12th of February, an unlucky day,<br> My own flesh and blood, I did slay,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I cut its throat, the blood did flow,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then on the fire I did it throw.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>  Before my God I shortly must appear,<br> Where I shall meet my baby dear,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Guilty at the bar I can only say,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Lord, have mercy en my sol I pray.<p>  One night as in my cell I lay,<br>I thought there was a voice did say,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; These blessed words eas'd my mind,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seek mercy and thou'lt mercy find.<p> O when that dreadful day shall come,<br>When I on earth receive my doom,<br>Good people, do pray for me<br>  That my Redeemer will set me free.<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  When I am brought to the fatal tree,<br>Young women take advice by me,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If by false men you deceiv'ed should be,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  From the crime of murder God keep yon free<p>The Night before the Execution she wrote the following LETTER<p>to her mother.<p>Dear Mother,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Twelve o'clock, Sunday night.<p>I am sorry we could not have the liberty of a little<br>more time by ourselves when you came to take leave of me ; if we<br>had, I should have thought of many more things to say you than I<br>did; but then, I fear it would have caused more grief at our parting.<br>I am greatly concerned at being obliged to leave you, and muck<br>more in such a manner as to leave room for the world to reflect<br>upon you on my account; but none save the ignorant will, but ra-<br>ther pity your misfortune, being fully satisfied of your innocence<br>in every respect relating to the crime for which I am in a few hours<br>to suffer the last awful punishment of the law.<p>After I parted with you, I received the holy sacrament comfortab-<br>ly which the minister was so good as to administer to me, and who<br>has also several times before taken great pains to instruct me, and<br>so has some other one of his accquaintance, by whose assistance,<br>and my on endeavours, I hope God will pardon all my sins for<br>Ghrist's sake, and admit me into his heavenly kingdom.<p>I hope I will willingly submit to my fate, and die in peace. This<br>is all the comfort I can give you in this world, who dying, remains<br>your affectonate daughter,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; M, HENDERSON.<p>Edinburgh, Printed, for James Degherty, Price One Penny.</p>
