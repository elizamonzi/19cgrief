	<p> Seven Men<p>Sentenced to Die.<p>An account of the notorious WILLIAM PROBERT, and<br>Six other unfortunate Men, who are all to be Executed in<br>London on Monday Morning next, for the crimes of Horse-<br>Stealing and Forgery. Probert was the companion of the late-<br>notorious Thurtell and Hunt, the horrid Murderers, the for-<br>mer of whom was also executed, for the bloody murder of their.<br>companion, William Weare, in a lonely part of the country.<p>Tuesday the 14th June, the Recorder of London made a report to the King in<br>Council, of the prisoners remaining under sentence of death in the gaol of Newgate,<br>who were convicted at the two last Old Bailey Sessions, namely?<p>William Probert aged 33, and Wm. Sargeant alias Thos. Baker 30, of horse-Steal.<br>ing, Henry Goff 18; James Corbet 17; Stephen Medwinter 14; Edw. David Dunn<br>17; James Golf 21; Edward Crawley 17; of burglary. Henry Williams 27; Frederick<br>Morgan 17; Elizabeth Doyle 21; Henry Brown.23; and John Bowers 27; of stealing<br>in a dwelling house to the amount of 40s. and upwards. John Thompson 17, of<br>highway rubberv; and Wm. August 23, of cutting and maiming. Henry Morgan 23,<br>of housebreaking; Jacob Myers 15, highway robbery. Wm. Brooks 25; Wm. Ben-<br>yon 41; James Harper 30; James Hill 18, horse stealing. James Broom 17; Wilfred<br>Barnett 19; Joseph Saint 13; Mary Beresford 28, Elizabeth Powell 23; Thos. Her-<br>ring 24; John Wilcox 16; Henry Palmer 23; and Peter Carrel alias Geo. Day 18;<br>stealing in a dwelling house to the amount of 40s. and upwards. Daniel Morgan<br>18; James Brown 15; John Turpin alias Tuck 21; Wm. Royston 15; Joseph Flowers<br>19; John Smith 23; and Wm. Mills 22, burglary.<p>His Majesty was graciously pleased to respite, during his Royal pleasure, all the<br>above named convicts, excepting William Probert, William Sargeant, James  Har-<br>per, John Smith, Edward David Dunn, James Goff, upon whom the law is left to<br>take its course, and they are ordered for Execution on Monday next.<p>Probert was found guilty of stealing a mare, value L.25, on the 10th Feb. last,<br>the property of William Meredith, (a relation of his own) in the county of Glouces-<br>ter, and which he took to London and sold.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  <p>It will be recollected that Probert was the companion and friend of John Thurtell<br>and Henry Hunt, who were all concerned in the savage and bloody murder of one<br>of their bottle  friends, whom they decoyed out of London into a lonely part of the<br>country, and brutally murdered him, which created a great sensation throughout the<br>whole country at  the  time, and for which Thurtell was executed, and Hunt banish-<br>ed for life, in consequence of his .confession where the dead body was concealed; but<br>Probert having been admitted a witness against his companions,he, for a time escap-<br>ed that fate which his crimes so justly deserved, and which now most assuredly a-<br>waits him on Monday morning next.<p>Ever since his dismissal from custody he had been wandering about the country,<br>and even in the remotest village he was spurned as an outcast from society, and<br>hunted down like a wild beast of the forest. He and his wife were both on the point<br>of starvation, and without a friend to assist them, which drove him to commit the<br>crime  which seated his doom.<p>On learning his fate he was greatly surprised, as he always expected that his life<br>would have been spared, and immediately sat down to write letters to his wife and<br>aged mother.<p>Glasgow?Printed by John Muir.</p>
