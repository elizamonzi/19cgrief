	<p> THE POOR Discharged Soldier.<p><p>Gather round me, one an'all. great and small, short and tall,<br>Till you hear the sad down fall of the poor soldier boy.<br>That has fought by land and sea, night and day far away,<br>For thirteenpence a day, says the poor soldier boy.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ]<p>But after all I've done and the battles I have won.<br>In place of march I got the run, which does me sore annoy.<br>With my old red coat all tore. and my bones both bruised & sore,<br>I'm left starving on the shore, says the poor soldier boy,<p>The next thing I've to tell, mark it well.  what befel,<br>My old shirt I had to sell, says the poor soldier boy,<br>For hunger I can't bear, I declare, and I swear,<br>For bread I'd sell my hair, says the poor soldier boy.<p>But before in rags I 'd fly some roguery I must try,<br>I 'll break an arm or blind an eye,  some blunt for to decoy,<br>Then I'll go through the town, with my medal hanging down,<br>Saying, for glory and renown, help the poor soldier boy.<p>When  I was at Waterloo, I tell to you it is true,<br>My old red coat was new, says the poor soldier boy,<br>And likewise at Cabul&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I smashed many in the skull,<br>But his belly it was full says the poor soldier boy.<p>At Vitoria and the Nile, I cut them rank and file,<br>I never thought awhile that they'd make me such a toy,<br>As to turn me away. without one penny in the day.<br>After smashing China, clear the way, says the poor soldier boy.<p>It's when this bill was passed, we were cast, very fast,<br>We're all begging now at last, says the poor soldier boy.<br>We are going about like Jews, without hats, shirts or shoes,<br>For to live upon strange news, says the poor soldier boy.<p>Now we can stand at ease, at any corner that we please,<br>Into every tavern gaze, for to comfort us with joy,<br>Where we'll see bread and meat on each plate, that we could eat,<br>But our blunt was out of date, says the poor soldier boy.<p>Now very long ago, you must know, it was so,<br>Off to India I did go,  says the poor soldier boy,<br>And fought the black men there, I declare, and I swear,<br>Without either dread or fear, says the poor soldier boy.<p>But after the campain I was sent back again,<br>Some were kilt, and more were lame but it mattered not a toy,<br>They'd no penison give to I, live or die, I might fly,<br>To the devil or Buckleroy. says the poor soldier boy.<p>So now to end my theme, I'm to blame for the same,<br>I wish I had been slain, says the poor soldier boy.<br>When  I took a delight to go and fight. out of spite,<br>Away off to the Sikhs, says the poor soldier boy.<p>But all for my vallantry, in that glorious victory.<br>See what they've done to we. and how they did destroy,<br>They sent me for to wait at the mendieiy gate.<br>To get skilly on a plate, says the poor soldier boy.</p>
