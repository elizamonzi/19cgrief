	<h2>Transcription</h2>
	<p> A Genuine copy of a most affecting<br>letter sent by one of these young men,<br>lately executed, to a young woman<br>belonging to Edinburgh, with whom<br>he has carried on correspondence for<br>some years, with his dying advice and<br>request to her, which is published with<br>her own consent.<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Edinburgh 24th January 1824.<p>Dear____?, I address you through the medium of Mr ???,<br>a man who has, by his distinguished kindness and pious ex<br>hortations, rendered himself dear to my soul; and whose un-<br>weared exertions towards the promotion of my eternal well-<br>being, constrain me to supplicate, with unfeigned earnestness,<br>the blessing of that Being who alone can reward him for his<br>labours of love, to deecend and abide upon  him and all with<br>whom he is connected.<p>You may perhaps be surprised at my not writing this last<br>epistle with my own hands: but I can assure you this task I<br>would willingly have performed, had I been capable of settling<br>my mind for that space of time. Let this suffice, therefore,<br>for my tendering you, in this way, the following advice.<p>In commencing this letter, reflection on  the numerous<br>scenes of innocent mirth through which we have passed, and<br>the consideration that this is the last opportunity I shall ever<br>have of addressing one for whom, while life remains, I shall<br>bear the most profound respect, force a sting upon my dis-<br>turbed mind, and almost succeed in driving me to the brink<br>of despair. But there is a balm for every wound. When,<br>I look back upon the actions which have stained with infamy<br>the years that are past, my Soul would assuredly sink within<br>me, did not the blessed volume of divine inspiration point<br>out to the vilest of the race of Adam, a fountain where<br>every stain may be washed away, every transgression obliter-<br>ated. Yes, blessed be God,  I have been brought to the<br>knowledge of that Saviour, by the merits of whose all-atoning<br>sacrifice alone, the chief of sinners may obtain the mercy and<br>forgiveness of an offened Deity. The hardened conduct<br>which I displayed On hearing of Douglas' respite, I now sin-<br>cerely regret; and hope that he will take into sarious con-<br>sideration" his awful situation before the Majesty of heaver,<br>and earnestly set about the great and important work of his<br>soul's salvation. And now., that I am about to leave this<br>vale of sin and sorrowing, the following short exhortation.<br>will not, I hope, be unreasanable.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  .<p>Peruse carefully, the sacred Scriptures, for in them are con-<br>tained the words of eternal life. Cast an glance at your by-<br>past life, and redeem the time as those days have been evil.<br>Flee, I beseech you, to that Rock of Ages, who is a hiding<br>from the storm, and a covert from the tempest. Enlist<br>speedily under the banners of the great Captain of Salvation,<br>in the assurance that through him who hath overcome, you<br>will be made more than conqueror. And that the God of<br>all grsee may conduct you by his counsel, and afterwards re<br>ceive yon to his glory, is the heartfelt wish of your most<br>sincere friend.<p>The above letter was given un to the young woman, and<br>by the care and earnestness with which she peruses it daily,<br>it is hoped that it will be a compass to steer her through this<br>sinful and dreary world, by following the dying advice of<br>one she loved, and who now lies mouldering in the dust.<br>This was copied from the original, by a person whom the<br>young woman shewed it to, and is allowed to be printed with<br>her consent. <p></p>
