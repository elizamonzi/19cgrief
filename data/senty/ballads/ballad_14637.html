	<p> Humours of the Age!<p>Chuse where and what you will, here are some things<br>new to suit and to please Old and Young, Deaf<br>and Dumb, Mad, Lame and Lazy, Young Men who<br>walk in their Sleep, Old Maids who have no Teeth,<br>and Dairy Maids; Cheats and Dandies, containing<br>the Humours of the Age, being Whimsical, Witty<br>and Diverting!<p>I never think of a wife until I am hungry, and then I look for<br>a lewd woman, in hopes she will find me a morsel of bread.<p>I love whisky and strong beer twice in the year, that is summer<br>and winter.<p>I hate Lawyers and Liars, because they breed wrangling and<br>jangling.<p>I would be a soldier, was there all plundering and no fighting.<p>I love a clergyman that practises what he preaches, for other-<br>wise we must mind what he says and not what he does.<p>If ever I marry I will have the ugliest woman I can find, then I<br>shall have her to myself.<p>Shew me a poet, a painter, and a quaker, and I will shew you<br>three liars.<p>Of all men in the world blind men walk most upright, so they<br>are the most charitable, for they never see their neighbours faults.<p>Of all people I pity lewd women, for they hazard both soul and<br>body for a bad living.<p>Sailors are the bravest and the merriest fellows in the world, for<br>they drink and dance when there is but one inch between them and<br>a watery grave.<p>The astrologer is a wise man, he can foretell future events, but<br>not the man that cuckolds him, nor when.<p>Tea and tobacco are pernicious weeds, and grand thieves, they de-<br>serve hanging more than highwaymen, for they pick the pockets of<br>the whole nation.<p>There are five great rarities hard to find, a black swan, a phoenix,<br>a unicorn, the philosopher's stone, and a maid at sixteen.<p>If extortioners cannot enter the kingdom of heaven, where must<br>usurers, tallymen and pawnbrokers go to ?<p>Soldiers and butchers are very near relations; for they both live<br>by killing and slaying.<p>I never see a tailor but he puts me in mind of a cabbage, or a<br>miller, or a weaver, but I think on a thief.<p>Good old women, and good small beer, are hard to be found,<br>yet these are good in their kind.<p>What is the difference between ale-dealers and linen-drapers ?<br>Only this, one cheats you with froth, and the other with cloth.<p>Number me the sands on the sea shore, and the stars in the sky,<br>and I will number you the faults of a lewd woman. Yet a virtuous<br>woman is the pride of nature, and the glory of the universe?but<br>where shall I find her ?<p>To portion daughters, and to build ships, are chargeable things,<br>yet, after all costs and pains, they prove leaky vessels.<p>Had I three sons, if one of them was a dunce, two should prac-<br>tise law and physic, and the other should be a minister.<p>There are five things wonderfully swift ? Fame, which, like a<br>snow-ball, gathers as it goes?a musket shot, that kills before you<br>hear the report?the sight, which reaches the heavens in an instant<br>?thought, that traverses the globe in a moment?lightning, that<br>kills the child in the womb and hurts not the mother, and melts<br>gold in a bag without scorching the canvas.<p>Some say that Britain is the garden of the world, but, as Buona-<br>parte said, " There is many a bitter weed in it." Others say, " It<br>is the paradise for women?a purgatory for servants?and a hell<br>for horses." We have the handsomest women in the world, I must<br>own, and we give them the greatest privileges?the honour of the<br>wall, the third of our effects, and the like of that, yet they seldom<br>repay us with any thing but a large pair of horns; and, like the<br>devil, the more you humour them, the worse they are; give them<br>an inch, and they will take an ell.<p>But there is no general rule without exception, what I speak is<br>the bad humours of men?one story is good till another is told?<br>in the mean time give me leave to speak my thoughts. Those that<br>are good husbands make good wives ; and if they are bad, there<br>are six of one and half a dozen of the other. God help us all.<p>And thus I have finished what I first proposed,<p>And if I have more or less of truth disclosed<p>Than what you like, excuse me for this time,<p>As need makes old wives trot, and poets rhyme;<p>Therefore extend your halfpence, if you please,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<p>And I'll pray for you all my remaining days.<p>EDINBURGH:?Reprinted by Menzies, Lawnmarket.<p></p>
