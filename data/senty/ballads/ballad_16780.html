	<p> The fate of Johunng Johnston.<p>L[e]t us as Christian people<br>For a moment contemplate<br>On that awful crime at Whifflet<br>On young Johnny Johnston's fate,<br>At the age of thirteen, murdered,<br>All in secret, in a room,<br>Which had chilled the hearts of thousands<br>When report spread of his doom.<p>Countless were the sympathisers<br>Of the parents of the boy,<br>Who had been to them from childhood,<br>Their delight, their hope, and joy,<br>And what wonder at their grieving<br>O'er a boy so free from blame,<br>When the good boy gives such promise<br>That the man will be the same.<p>To a house which was adjacent<br>To his home he was decoyed,<br>And while there his joyous young life<br>Had been cruelly destroyed.<br>Then his charred remains  were bundled<br>And tied on to a go-cart<br>Which was wheeled along  to Glasgow<br>By a fiend without a heart.<p>The most daring pen of fiction<br>Would not venture to depict<br>Such audacity and coolness<br>Through&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;populous&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;district,<br>But the temper leaves the culprit<br>Blind&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to  sense&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of shame,<br>Who&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;may&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;walk abroad as coolly<br>As a person&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;free  from  blame.<p>Kindly was that lorry  driver<br>Who&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;knew&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;nothing&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of her drift,<br>Who on going into&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Glasgow<br>Gave&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the  poor  tired woman a lift,<br>And that kindly hearted  fellow<br>Most&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;politely put her down,<br>At the place  that&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;she requested,<br>On the outskirts of the town<p>Here a little boot protruded<br>From the bundle, which was seen<br>By a woman at a window,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>Whose perception had been keen,<br>And that keen perceptive woman<br>In her duty was not slack, <br>For she in the shortest notice<br>Put the right man on her track.<p>What had been the person's motive<br>For committing such a crime ?<br>Is the question one keeps asking<br>And repeating all the time<br>Surely not for the few coppers<br>Which the little fellow had-<br>That he got for selling papers<br>For a little comrade lad.<p>In this land of open Bibles<br>Where the Church-bells ring so loud,<br>Of some people's moral standing<br>We have reason to be proud,<br>Where a little boy is murdered,<br>Whom his parents held so dear,<br>For the paltry sum of ninepence<br>To obtain a drink of beer.<p>Royal was the splendid funeral<br>Which the public to him gave,<br>For the roads were black with people<br>From his home right to his grave,<br>Out they came in tens of thousands,<br>Out from home some miles away,<br>Out as sympathetic mourners,<br>They came on Johnny's funeral day.<p>And with undivided sorrow<br>That last tribute of respect,<br>Had been shown to him by people<br>Who had known the home was wrecked.<br>Of his poor grief-stricken parents<br>Bowed beneath their weighty cross,<br>Left to drain their cup of sadness,<br>And to deeply mourn their loss.<p>W M.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;MARKHAM&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;BROWN,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3 Davidson Street, AIRDRIE.</p>
