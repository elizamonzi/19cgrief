The first effort of the Company in this walk, was to exhibit a grand<br>attack of the wild and ferocious animals upon the tame, which afforded great<br>amusement to the spectators for some time. At length a victim was singled out,<br>and all the wild animals made a dead set at him. But he, however, proved too<br>heavy a match for the whole Menagerie, from a consciousness of his own strength,<br>and being well guarded by the bars of good service, and the invulnerable shield of<br>public opinion. As in the case of the Lion Nero when baited by a host of dogs, the<br>public thought the sport partook too much of " Cruelty to Animals," separated the<br>combatants by sending them to Ward (the Second), when the Electors chained up<br>the grim and Black Britannica Mastiff that led the attack, and put the little<br>conceited Cur, " Jugurtha," that accompanied him, under the Turf, and neither of<br>them have been heard of since.<p>Some of the former Actors, however, were resolved to have another attempt at<br>these recreations, and being strengthened by new recruits, "young nimals" from<br>the Cowgate, and other districts, they resolved upon a representation on a grand<br>scale.?A meeting of 18 of them was privately held, the plot was arranged, and a<br>rehearsal took place. In strict accordance with the propensity of all savage tribes<br>and wild animals to attack their superiors, they resolved in this instance, that the<br>attack should be made upon their Right Honourable Keeper. The plot was based<br>on the historical fact, that the Keeper had dared to dine in human and humane<br>society, and not in the Menagerie, which greatly displeased the savage part of the<br>Collection, particularly the Hippo-potatoe-tamus, (which, by the bye, is rather a<br>carniverous than a herbiverous specimen of the species). This uncouth monster<br>complained that he had not been taken along with the Keeper to eat up the bones<br>and scraps which he left,?and he insisted that, (as was obvious to every Observer,)<br>the savage animals being in the majority, they ought, with one accord, to attack<br>and rend the Keeper. Hippo, also declared, that the Keeper was too good and too<br>learned for their Menagerie,?that he had in a metaphorical speech attempted to<br>detract from their merits, by describing a set of animals who went at large, of the<br>GENUS CLIQUE-a  species, he said, that " forgot nothing, and forgave nothing,"<br>and who, on discovering a vulnerable part, if even in the heel, they, tiger-<br>like, spring upon their victim to destruction." As there was no Tiger in the<br>Royal Exchange Collection, and as it was well known that most of the<br>animals partook more of the nature of the Wolf and the Fox than of the<br>Lion and Tiger, and believing there could be no race more vindictive and re-<br>lentless than themselves, they could not believe that his metaphorical speech<br>applied to any other Collection, and they were therefore well entitled to be wroth<br>with him for daring to describe them out of their proper Den, and came to an unani-<br>mous resolution, that if not destroyed, he should, at least, be instantly bound and<br>gagged. At the rehearsal, and as a preliminary to the Drama, a letter was written<br>to the Keeper, demanding to be informed if he really had dined with gentlemen, and<br>described the Menagerie there. To this letter as they expected, the Keeper made no<br>reply, but treated it with marked contempt, denying their right to question or gag<br>him, and declaring that he was their independent Keeper, by virtue of an Act of<br>Parliament, that he would go where he pleased, and speak when and how he pleased.<br>The Actors having got their parts assigned them for the Tuesday's exhibition, and<br>the Drama having been well advertised, a considerable audience attended the Theatre.<br>Owing, however, to some of the Actors not having got their parts well learned, the<br>company was treated to a very small encounter, led on by a young, though vigorous<br>and talented specimen of the " Genus Legal," who sustained his part without that<br>ferocity the spectators had expected. He seemed, upon the whole, unwilling to the<br>work, and gave decided indications that he may not play at all next week. The<br>second part, was sustained by a lank greyish-looking old Fox of the genus " Sub-<br>Legal," supposed to be originally from Glasgow. The chain of this animal seemed<br>to restrain his efforts a good deal ; and although he would fain have bitten the<br>Keeper by way of diverting the audience from his awkward position, he could not<br>accomplish it, and, upon the whole, his attack was considered a failure. Seeing the<br>unhappy manner in which the Drama was likely to end, a well-conditioned little crea-<br>ture of the "Genus Medic?,"with great tact, turned the tide of applause from the Ac-<br>tors to the Keeper. He said, with much feeling, that he hated all such beastly exhibi-<br>tions, and that the Theatre should be kept for the performance of the Legitimate Civic<br>Drama, for which it was built, and that the handbill for next week's entertainment<br>should be thrown out of the Menagerie. Here the dignified little Keeper drew him-<br>self up in the attitude of defence, and keenly eyeing the most ferocious of the brutes,<br>said he knew well the nature of the animals he had to contend with?that they being<br>at present the majority of the Menagerie, he also knew he had no chance with them<br>__had nothing but a furious combat to expect; but that, as the responsible head of the<br>Theatre, he solemnly protested against the proposed Drama, as tending to lower the<br>Actors in the estimation of the public; and instead of gaining them " the praise and<br>protection of such as do well," would make them a "scoff and a bye-word" throughout<br>the civilized globe. As the audience had come for sport, however, he would treat<br>them to some little fun, grounded upon the plot which the " eighteen" had laid?he<br>would merely refer to some of their names, as sufficient amusement for the remain-<br>der of the day's entertainment ?First, he found a Goose which had lain for more than<br>eleven years on the Banks of the Menagerie, but who, as the feeders well knew, had<br>laid anything but golden eggs?more than once, they were found rotten, and brought<br>but a small dividend of their price,?next he found the clumsey, unwashed, Hippo-<br>potatoe-tamus, with a Wright sort of a Hyena, who licks his toes, and lies obedient<br>at his side,?the two Dunkeys, elder & younger, were there,?the whiskered & senior<br>chained Ourang-outang, although he did not  expect him was there he had  though<br>that all his former caressing might have [&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;] return from this animal,-<br>the silver-working Grampus and the [&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;] in chains) were there,-<br>the Grey Stot, and Stirk, the Sloth, (genus [&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;]ammarian) were there,-the<br>Ougly-Muck, and Friend-S------ks, (new importation, were there,-Sly Wig Gawky<br>and the old Chained Boar from the Canongate, were the,-the latter animal was<br>only expected to grunt when his chain was pulled this being considered the height<br>of his ability At this stage of the performance, the Hippo-potatoe-tamus gave a loud<br>growl, which was speedily checked by the Keeper, who reminded him of his newly<br>assumed character,and that although he had been accustomed all his days to wal-<br>low in  the mire, now that he had got into the company of more cleanly animals he<br>must really try to learn better manners.This closed&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  the performance,and the<br>audience left on the understanding, that the second part of the Drama is to come<br>off next Tuesday, and that the public will be supplied in good time with the names<br>racters of the Actors.</p>
