	<h2>Transcription</h2>
	<p> A full, true and particular account of a cruel, barbarous and inhu- <br>man murder committed on the body of Margaret Rankin daugh-<br>ter of John Rankin Polichorkin in Argyleshire, of which<br>Archibald M'Allum, by whom she was big with child is suspected<br>because he has fled from his father's  house at Ardnoe.<p>MAN's natural reason unassisted by divine<br>grace, is still hurrying him on to the<br>commission of daring acts of cruelty; but<br>While these keep short of shedding human<br>blood, We are apt to look upon them with less<br>detestation, and paliate some part of their guilt<br>in our minds; or even when blood is shed<br>in a person's own defence when attacked by<br>another person, we do not look upon it in so<br>black a light as when one unprovoked attack,<br>in cold blood an innocent, unsuspecting per-<br>son with a manifest intention to take away<br>his life. In the first case, the laws of both<br>God and man has provided certain cafes in<br>which the dilinquent is not to be punished<br>with so great Severity as in the last, where<br>we are premptorily forbid to spare or have<br>pity upon them, but in anywise to put them<br>to death; which if we do not, the scripture<br>expressly saith, that we become partakers of<br>their crime, and thereby bring innocent blood<br>upon the land. <p>It is very hard to account for the reasons<br>which induce men to murder one another in<br>cold blood,--and in such a manner as the<br>following, where we may see a wretch em-<br>brueing his hands in the blood of an innocent<br>young woman, whose only crime to him, was,<br>that the had too, too much regard for the<br>inhumane monster! This wretch, (for I can-<br>not call him a man) Archibald M'Alluw, son<br>of John M'Allum in Ardnoe, in the shire of<br>Argyle, he had pretended love, I say pre-<br>tended (for it was only malice) to Margaret<br>Rankin, daughter of John Rankin in  Poli-<br>chorkin in the county of Argyle, one of his<br>father's neighbours, and, no doubt, had used<br>all these hellish arts praised by villains, too<br>often with success, to seduce her into a crimi-<br>nal correspondence with him, to which she,<br>alas! too easily consented. O! had the known<br>his black heart, and the hellishness of his in-<br>tentions, she never had  consented to such<br>criminality, nor suffered to unmerited a pu-<br>nishiment from him : But to return, she at last<br>proved with child by him, and was far ad-<br>vanced in her pregnancy, and, no doubt im-<br>portuning him to fulfill his promises of marry-<br>ing her, to take away her reproach from a-<br>mong women.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This humble and reasonable<br>requist only hurried him on to commit what<br>he had no doubt, concerted before in  his<br>mind, the horrid intention of murdering her<br>to be quite of her importunity, as he never<br>had any intention of marrying her.<p>This malevolent crime he put in practice<br>on Sunday the l2th of August 1792, choos-<br>ing that day as the most convenient for his<br>infernal purpose, when her father and the<br>rest of the family were at divine worship, who<br>if at home would have protected her from his<br>blood thirsty hands; on that day, as we may<br>easily suppose,  she had known the family's<br>intentions and that the would be alone in the<br>house, and therefore sent or desired him to<br>come to her in order to consult how matters<br>were to be settled, and as she had a heart full<br>of honest sentiments, and the deepest regard<br>for him, never doubted but that his dissem-<br>bling professions were as sincere as her own,<br>on that account little thought of her fast ap-<br>proaching fate.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He attended her at her fa-<br>ther's house according to proposal, but little<br>to her profit, for, when her people returned<br>from church,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to their great surprize, they<br>found her strangled.  With several marks of<br>Violence upon her body.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They could not<br>think of any person who could be guilty of<br>this except the said Archibald M' Allum, and<br>as it was late before they could settle matters,<br>they could not send that night, but, however,<br>they sent next&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;morning,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;found  that<br>Archibald had absconded, and that night they<br>heard he had been seen  running through<br>Glenkinlas in a frighted like manner on that<br>day, which is the nearest road  to the low<br>country in order to escape.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Fool that he is<br>to think to escape from his own guilty con-<br>science, and the wrath of an offended God.<p><p>By this fatal catastrophe, he has not only<br>brought wrath upon himself, but has render-<br>ed two families compleatly miserable, his own<br>family unhappy in having such an unnatural<br>child who has brought disgrace upon them,<br>such a disgrace as will bring their gray hairs<br>with sorrow to the grave; while her family<br>must be unconsolable in having a blooming<br>daughter both debauched and murdered by<br>such a villain.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now let us consider the case<br>fairly, and we will easily fee what havock sin<br>makes in the world, especially such sins as<br>this.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If he had been virtuous and married<br>the woman,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What a contrast! instead of the<br>miserable situation they are now in, the one<br>family a son and the other a daughter living<br>together in harmony and peace, an offspring<br>rising from thence to gladen their aged hearts,<br>and make one gleam of joy shine on their<br>evening  hours,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In, the mean time, I hope<br>this will be a lesson to young women not to<br>trust too far the flattering delusions of young<br>men, for if their love be real, they will ra-<br>ther chuse the solid enjoyment of the married<br>state, than the stolen enjoyment of a criminal<br>correspondence.<p>What is remarkable, this man, so old in<br>villainy, is only about 26 years of age, as<br>may be seen by the advertisements for appre-<br>hending him in the Glasgow news papers.</p>
