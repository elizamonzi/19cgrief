	<p> COPY OF<p>A LETTER<p>FROM MICHAEL M' CABE.<p>Just published, an interesting Letter from Michael<br>M'Cabe, now lying under Sentence of Death,<br>on the Gaud, in the Calton Jail, addressed to<br>Rebecca Hudson, Bell's Wynd, his Sweetheart,<p>which is published here by his own desire.<p><p>EDINBURGH, 4th Feb. 1833.<br>CONDEMNED CELL, CALTON JAIL<br>"To REBECCA HUDSON,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'<p>' Bell's Wynd.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <p>" MY DEAR&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;REBECCA,<p>" No doubt but you would feel<p>truly sorry when you heard of my awful sentence, and I am<br>sure that you will have been watching every opportunity to<br>hear of any reprive having been sent to me by our Gracious<br>Sovereign ; but alas Reba, no such happy and welcome tid-<br>ings have as yet been transmitted to me. Every moment ap-<br>pears 28 an hour to me, fondly cherishing, as I do, the hope<br>that a reprive, or ar lease a respite, will yet be forthcoming.<br>But even when I reflect on our separation for life, death would<br>be still more welcome. In sorrow and bitterness do I repent<br>of my ill spent life, now that I see my days drawing nigh a<br>close. O that I had abided to the instructions of my youth?<br>that I had abstained from idleness and evil company?minded<br>the Sabbath day?that I had attended closely to my business,<br>theu might I at this moment of painful suffering, been as<br>happy as any of the innocent companions of my childish days,<br>I have now only to warn you and other associates in my<br>guilt, to abstain from bad company?to form a new erra in<br>your life,?to Remember the Sabbath day, and Keep it holy,<br>?to dash the venemous glass of ardent spirits from your<br>mouths, as you would do the most naucious drug, and then<br>your suffering on the bed on death, will be very different from<br>mine. These are the causes of a premature end, which the<br>fruits of life spent like ours, in dissipation, villany, and crime.<br>Every attention is paid to me here, the Jailors are very kind<br>aad' I am regularly attended by a clergyman, by whose assi-<br>duity and feeling-heartedness, I am led to turn my wandering<br>thoughts on the means of expiation, at that Tribunal where<br>the judgment of men has no controul. From the liberal ed.<br>ucation which I received from charitable institutions in Ed-<br>inburgh, I am, thank God, enable to read the Bible, which<br>has hitherto been too carelessly thrown aside. In it I feel<br> unbounded comfort, and I would strongly exhort you to read<br>it, for in it you will find more comfort, than any gratification<br>which your wicked companions can suggest. An advice of<br>this kind, coming from a preacher on the streets may have<br>little or no impression, but I trust and hope, that coming<br>from one of your late companions in guilt, it will have an ef-<br>fectual, and everlasting impression, and than I will have done<br>one good turn ; I will then be the cause of the saving of a<br>soul. Dear Rebecca, if you could get some printer to revise<br>this, and publish it, it may be the means of doing good, for<br>who can hear the groans of a eulprit, whose honors are so near<br>and bat will feel affected, and take his sayings seriously to<br>heart. O that it may make a lasting impression upon the<br>hearts of many, and turn them from the broad road of misery<br>destruction, and death. I had a visit from my sister, but<br>both her feelings and mine, were so overpowered, that I sunk<br>into a state of insensibility. May God bless her and all my<br>relations, and may they nor yov, nor any of my late com-<br>panions sorry in my death.?I must now bid you an eternal<br>adieu,<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;MICIAEL M'CABE.</p>
