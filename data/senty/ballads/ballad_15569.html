	<p> LAMENTATION OF GEORGE GILCHRIST.<p>Now&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; under&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;sentence&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; of&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;death&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; in&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Edinburgh.<p>If I had been contented, and carried on my trade,<br>I would, have been much happier, and money would have made,<br>But was hast'ning to he rich, and fell into a snare,<br>Which 1 would tell to every  one, to make them all beware.<p>For money is so strange a thing it leadeth to all ill,.<p>By  it the devil leadeth man a captive at his will,<p>And many a one by  taking it from whence they had no  claim..<p>Has brought himself as I have done into much grief and shame<p>I'm now a wretched prisoner condemned in the Jail,<br>And very few will pity me although thy  hear my tale,<br>But oh ! good people think of this, that you may  also fall<br>For it is not&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;in our own strength that we do walk at  all.<p>A great temptation wrought on me to make me rob the coach,<br>And every day  it stronger grew and on me did encroach,<br>I very shortly form'd a plan by which it might be done,<br>And thought the money in the coach we would have for our own,<p>So knowing that on certain days the bank did money send,  <p>I plans in execution put; and did it to the end. <p>That none might occupy the coach but those that were with me,<br>Or how the money taken was, no.others there might see.<p>I dress'd myself in womens clothes attended by a man,<br>The inside seats we taken had which was the very  plan;<br>We then commenc'd and cut a hole and so took out the cash.<br>But had I known what was to come I would not been so rash.<p>For three of them who saw and knew King's evidence did turn,<br>And when 1 knew such was the case it made me deeply mourn,<br>And though  some were as bad as me that did against me swear,<p>They cannot feel as I have done since I was placed hers.<p>For now my days are number'd here and settled by man,<br>And I'm affraid it will be so though I do all I can,<br>For on the 3d of August next I&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;am&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;condemn'd to die,<br>I own the sentence to be just the crime I don't deny.<p>Now in this dreary cell I lye and do my  case bewail,<p>By keeping of bad company the truth to you I tell.<p>For had I been an upright man I never would been here,<p>Or kept in mind the law of God from theft for to keep clear. <p>But I did covet other's wealth in hopes for to be great,<br>And when I think on all my  ways it makes me mourn my fate,<br>That ever I thought on the plan, or with these men did go,<br>For rattling chains does now me bind,I can't express My  woe.<p>Four thousand pounds I've giv'n up expecting to got clear,<br>And hope His gracious Majesty  will my petition hear,<br>If he in mercy grant the same: as bound I'll ever pray.<br>And  think upon his goodness great unto my latest day.<p>likewise my friends will happy be to think that it is so,<br>Which will remove from all their hearts a load of grief end woe..<br>To think the sentence past on me is not to be enforced,<br>And hear that what I've undergone will likely  be the worst.<p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<p>EXECUTION <p>SECOND EDITION<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<p>Full, True, and  Particular Account of the EXECUTION  &  Gorge <p>Gilclirist at the head of Libberton 's, Wynd, on the morning of the <br>third of August, 1831, for  the robbery of the Prince Regent, Edin-<p>burgh  coach, of five Thousand seven Hundred and  Twelve Pound,<br>Six Shillings , sterling, the property of the  Commercial Bank.,__<p>?his behaviour in the condemned cell,?his parting from his wife<br>and friends?and his behaviour in the Look  up  House during the<br>night before the execution, and on the  scaffold,?the whole by an<p>eyewitness.<p>This morning, between eight and nine o'clock, this unhappy culprit,<br>George Gilchrist, paid the last penalty of the law, by the forfeiture of<p>his life, by the hands of the common executioner, and in presence of a<p>great concourse of spectators, at the head of Libberton's Wynd,?<br>another tarrible example of the awful consequences of giving way to<br>inordinate and unlawful desires.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<p>The public is already aware, but it may be proper briefly to repeat ,<br>that the trial of George Gilchrist, in conjuction with two of  his alleged<br>accomplices, vis., his brother William Gilchrist. and James Brown.<br>took place before the High Court of justiciary, on the 14th of last.<p>month, and that after a patient and laborious investigation, which lasted<br>nearly twenty six hours, the jury unsnimously found George Gilchrist<p>guilty,?unanimously found the libel not proven against William<p>Gilchrist,?and by a pluralily  of voices  only found it not  proven<p>against James Brown.?Brown however has since fully confessed his<p>participation in the robbery, by returning to the Commercial Bank<br>nine hundred pounds of the stolen money.  which had fallen to his <p>share of the plunder,?an act which, Whether it proceeded from a<p>feeling of compunction and repentance, or from a desire to save the<p>life of his less fortunate accomplice George  Gilchrist, certainly in some<p>measure redeems his previous guilt.--George Gilchrist also, in the hope <p>of obtained remission of the capital punishment,has returned upwards<p>of four thousand pounds of the stolen money,-and it is understood<p>that the Commercial Bank has recovered the whole amount  of  me<p>money stolen,except something under the sum of three hundred pounds<p>sterling. Gilchrist was convicted chiefly on the evidence of his.<br>accomplices, viz. James Morrison, an inkeeper in Falkirk Robert<p>simpson,whom Morrison, had inveigled into the conspiracy, and<p>another man named Campbell. The Crown office, however, had by<br>the most laudable activity and perseverance, Succeeded in collecting<br>such an array of other evidence as was sufficient to sbstain that of the<br>accomplices, and to bring to light the whole of the nefarious transac-<br>tion, It accordingly appeared that George Gilchrist was the prime<br>mover in all the circumstances of the robbery. He arrayed himself in<p>female attire and was one of the inside passanger; in the coach.<p>Robert Simpson accompanied him as the other inside passanger; and <p>these two, being provided with proper implements, broke through<br>the frame work of the coach into the front boot; and having then.<br>prized open the tin box containing the treasure, effectually. succeeded<br>in carrying off money, in bank notes and gold, to the large amount of<p>five thousand seven hundred and twelve pounds six shilling sterling;<p>-James Brown was on the outside of the coach as an outside passen-<p>ger, where he not only by means of a.long and heavy chain, kept up<br>so loud and jingling a noise as to prevent the noise mads by his con-<p>effected, and in consequence of which he desired the coachman to stop,<br>and, with the appearance of friendly alacrity towards the coachman,<br>alighted and let out his accomplices.<p>Never was any robbery more skilfully planned or executed ; and the<br>perpetrators could never have been convicted but by the evidence of<br>some of themselves. Indeed we have heard on authority on which <p>we can place reliance, that the robbery was planned originally by the<p>famous John Wilson, and Hemilton, now under sentence of transporta-<p>tion for other crimes, and  that it was carried into execution  by<br>Gilchrist only in consequence of his having been privy to their design<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the condemned cell the conduct of Gilchrist was composed,<p>penitent, and in other respects becoming his awful situation.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He made<p>a full confession of his crime and of the justice of his sentence. His<p>parting from his wife and some other friends was truly heart rending.<p>Last night he was removed from the jail to the lock up house, where<br>he spent the greater part of the night in devotions, assisted by the<br>pious clergymen, who  rendered  to him that last  consolation of their<br>holy office.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <p>About eight o'clock this morning,the Magistrates&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and other legal<p>attendants having arrived, the melancholy procession moved with the<p>culprit to the scaffold, at the head of Libberton's Wynd, where, after<p>a short time spent in prayer and in the singing of a psalm, the wretched<p>man was in the usual manner launched into eternity. after hanging<p>the usual time the body was cut down, and will of course be delivered<p>up to his friends for interment.<p>FURTHER PARTICULARS,<p>The unhappy  man  locked fatter than he appeared  to be at the time<p> of  his trial . During the whole way from the lock up house to the&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<p>scaffold his tottering  steps betrayed the feebleness  both of his  body<p> and mind. he was very pale. On the scaffold, he  turned  round,  <p>looked at the fatal gibbet,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; shuddered violently and&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;drew a sigh,  so<p>long and deep, and lend that it  was andibly beard among the  spe- <p>ctors. But he rallied again, and joined in the devotions with firm<p>voice. Before mounting the drop , however , his firmness again desers-<br>ed  him. He seemed most unwilling to take that final and fatal step,<p>and reeled and staggered for second as if he were drunk. He was<p>conducted on to the drop.and there he would have  fallen , had he<p>not been supported.He again relied and prayed servently. pini-<p>oned as he was he nevertheless assisted the executioner with his own <p>hands in adjusting the rope and the cap. He evidently made some <p>communication to the chaplain. The drop  fell while he was engaged<p>in servant prayer, exactly at half past eight ; and after a few severe<p>but short struggles his sufferings was at an end . He was a good <p>looking man, of middling stature,and aged about 35.<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
