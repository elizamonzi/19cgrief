	<p> EXECUTION.  <p>OOO-------------<p>Full and Particular Account of the .Execution of<br>THOMAS BLACK, who was Executed at the<br>Head of Libberton Wynd, Edinburgh, this mor-<br>ning, Wednesday the 10th December, 1823, for<br>Housebreaking and Theft; and of his Behaviour<br>since his condemnation, and at the Place of .Exe<br>cution. ,<p>THIS unhappy young man was Tried at Edinburgh, before the<br>High Court of Justiciary, on the 4th of November 1823, a.<br>long with another boy, John Reid, who has since been respited,<br>for Breaking into the Houoe at Summerfield, parish of South Leith,<br>occupied by Mr Alexander White,'Merchant, upon the morning of<br>25th July last, and, stealing therefrom-a great quantity of Silver<br>plate. Wearing Apparel, &c., aggravated by being habit and repute<br>a thief. After a full and fair investigation, this unfortunate lad,<br>and his neighbour, were by the unanimous verdict of a respectable<br>Jury, both found Guilty, in terms of the libel; but, on account of<br>their youth, strongly recommended to mercy.<p>During the trial the unfortunate Thomas Black was perfectly<br>composed, and maintained a careless indifference about his awful<br>situation; but, soon after, condemnation, he evinced a most becom-<br>ing sense of him melancholy situation, as well as the greatest con-<br>trition for his dissolute habits of life.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So much so, that a few<br>weeks before his Executiou, he requested to be indulged with a se-<br>parate cell as the society of his companions in misery led to con-<br>versations on their former way of life, which served to tnterupt his<br>more serious reflections, and to diveat his mind from these import-<br>ant considerations which his awful situation was so powerfully<br>calculated to excite.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A respite for his fellow sufferer. as stated a-<br>bove, was got fourteen days before and it can be no impeachment<br>of the generosity of the heart of Black, or of the sincerity of his<br>repentance, to find that this act of mercy to another awakened in<br>him all that love of life which had seemingly been extinguished<br>for ever.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He sunk into a state of the most heartless despondency<br>for some time, and could neither think of the present nor of the fu-<br>ture, withont the most agonizing feelings.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  Indeed, during two<br>days he scarcely tasted any food.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; His mind, however, was latterly<br>restored to its wonted tranquillity, and he expressed himself with<br>calmness and resignation on the subject of his approaching fate, an<br>event to which he had then looked forward as inevitable.<p>Accordingly, on Tuesday afternoon ha was removed to the Lock<br>up-house, where he was waited on by several of his nearest relations<br>and the separation from some of them was most appaling to the<br>most hardened feeliags. The Clergy of the city, as well as the<br>Chaplain of the Jail and other good Christians in town were mos<br>attentive and most etrnest for his religious instruction and ediflca<br>tion,- which he himself repeatedly and sincerely acknowledged.<p>He slept little or none on Tuesday evening, and the Clergymen<br>and Officiating Magistrates waited on him in the Hall of the Lock<br>up-house, a little before Eight o'Clock on Wednesday morning<br>when he joined most servently in devotional supplications put up<br>on that occasion. After which, his arms were pinioned, and the<br>melancholy procession soon moved up in a slow and solemn man-<br>ner, to the head of Libberton Wynd,attended by a strong detach-<br>ment of Police Officers. Ha appeared on the Scaffold, decently<br>dresaed, about half past Eight o'clock, where a psalm was sung, in<br>which he joined, and a most earnest and impressive prayer put up<br>for him to the thorne of mercy, by one of, the clcrgymen present<br>daring which he appeared most devout and attentive to what was<br>so eloquently urged in his behalf. Having taken a solemn fare-<br>well of those around him, he mounted the fatal drop, assisted by<br>the Executioner, where he appeared most servernt in prayer, while<br>the rope was adjusting round the beam. All things being prepar-<br>ed, and the Executioner taking farewell of him, he shortly drop<br>tha signal, and was instantly launthed into the world of spirits<br>a little before nine o'clock.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <p>We sincerety trust, that the premature and shameful end of this<br>young man who was only about 17 years of age, be a warning to<br>all who saw him, or heard of his awful fate.<p>Edinburgh, Printed, for James Dogherty, Price One Penny.</p>
