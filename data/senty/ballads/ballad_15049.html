	<p> COME DOWM AND OPEN THE DOOR,<br>L 0 V E.<p>Copies of this Popular Song can be had the Poet's Box,<br>182 OVERGATE, DUNDEE.<p>I'VE been to a party. I've been to A ball,<br>I've been where there's you can see :<br>I've been where there's swells, and  such pretty girls,<br>And I've had jolly good spree.<br>I've just staggered home, but I've lost my key,<br>My wife she won't open the door,<br>I've knocked and I've bawled, at the window throw<br>stones<br>For over two hours I'm sure<p>SPOKEN. ?Not a bit of use, 1 can't get in. I've been stuck out here<br>in the snow, and the hail, and the sleet, and the rain (hic) for about<br>two hours, more or less, whilest upstairs there's my daer, precious,<br>darling, loving, tender harted, fat-headed wife. (hic) She's got her<br>head on the pillow, and she dosen't care whether mine is under a cart<br>wheel, or where it is (hic) and I've been bowling out at the top of my<br>voice-<p>CHORUS.?<p>Come down and open the door,love<br>Come down and open the door,<br>It's snowing and hailing, I give you my word,<br>I wont stay out late any more.<br>Oh ! come down and open the door, love,<br>You will have some pity I'm sure.<br>I'm drippin wet through, oh what shall I do,<br>If you don't come down and open the door.<p>I've been in a row, and got knocked about, <br>They smashed my hat over my head ;<br>They emptied my pockets of all I had<br>And left me as tho' I were dead.<br>It's surprising to me I'm sure,<br>But somehow or other I have reached my home<br>And now that I'm here I can see very clear,<br>My wife she won't open the door.<p>SPOKEN. ?My wife's a wretch, (hic) oh, she is. Most singular isn't<br>it? You see I've been out to a bit of a tripe supper with Johnson<br>(hic) of course you all know Johnson. Most peculiar, when I went<br>out this evening, or rather last evening, I was walking along as nice<br>and quite and as comfortable as anybody possible could walk (hic),<br>when all at once one of those beastly Kirbstones jumped up and hit<br>me right in the eye. (hic) Take affidavit I never spok to him, some-<br>thing fell down, (hic) I think it was me, two policemen picked me up,<br>very kind of them. "Why," he says, "there's one of us." "Only<br>one of you, ha, ha, ha ! then I'm blowed if I can't see two," (hic)<br>and could too. Why don't you go home and get indoors ?" he says<br>(hic). "Well," says I "I've lost my key, so I'll ask my wife once<br>again very kindly to"?<p>I'll try once again to wake my wife up,<br>No doubt she's in a sound snore,<br>I'll throw a big brick, and the window I'll brake,<br>Which must wake her up I am sure.<br>But there it's no us, if the truth it was known,<br>She's peeping at me through the blind,<br>I'm dripping we through, inside and out too,<br>So come down and open the door.<p>SPOKEN.?Here's a nice position for a respectable married man at<br>three o'clock in the morning, (hic) got to sleep out all night on the<br>doorstep or somewhere. Oh, there she is I do belive. Yes, my dear,<br>it is me. what ? four o'clock ! all the clocks are wrong, I knew the<br>time exactly twenty minutes past, twelvt, just left Johnson, dear.<br>Who's drunk? (hic) I'm as sober as a judge (hic) (aside.) Now for<br>a  little soft soap (hic) "I've bought you that now  bonnet, dear, also<br>the plum coloured dress you admired so much (hic.) It's all right,<br>they'll  be home in the morning with the milk, (hic) or  by first parcel's<br>post. Will you come down darling an I shift the bolts of hall door,<br>back a little so that I can get my foot (aside) I'd put up with the<br>rest, (hic) so once more, allow me to ask you very humbley to"?</p>
