	<p> THE  LAST<p>SPEECH<p>Consession, and dying  declaration of  MORT COLLINS, Soldier<br>in the 27th Regiment of foot, who was execute at Glasgow, on <br>Wednesday the 7th of November 1792, and his Body  given to<br>the doctors, for the murder of John Panton, keeper of Bridwell.<p>MORT COLLINS aged 22 years, was born<br>in the County of Clare in Ireland, of honest<br>and industrious parents, who kept me at school<br>until I arrived at the age of fourteen years,<br>When I was bound an apprentice to the glazing<br>and painting business. After two years I broke<br>my Indenture, but agreed with another matter,<br>with whom I served as a journeyman for three<br>years, during the  latter part of which I began<br>to neglect my business and frequent bad com-<br>pany ; my companions taking advantage of the<br>silliness of my temper, easily led me into any<br>mischief they pleased. Once they enticed me,<br>when drunk, to beat a man in a most Unmerci-<br>ful manner, for this I was clapt in prisons and<br>afterwards tried before a Sheriff Court but<br>acquitied,the Sheriff gave me a long exhorta-<br>ion to reclaim me from my wicked conduct;<br>and ordered me to examine carefully my bad<br>inclinations and acquaint my parish pastor of<br>them, and follow the instructions and advices<br>he should dictate to me : this I never did, but<br>lived in perfect neglect of my holy religion;<br>and hence all my misfortunes.<p>At last by dedicating my whole time to drink<br>and women, I gave up my business altogether<br>and inlisted in the 37th regiment of foot, from<br>that time I continued the same evil practices till<br>they brought me to this end. But I declare to<br>God, that all my bad actions were the effects of<br>drink, and that I was so perfectly intoxicated<br>when the deed for which I am condemned was<br>perpetrated, that next morning I recollected<br>nothing of what had passed that night. I there-<br>for pray to God, that all young people may<br>take warning from me, beware of bad company,<br>liquor and women were my ruin. I invite the<br>the whole creation to praise the Lord for his<br>tender mercies to me in bringing me to a true<br>sense of my misery after such a wicked life, and<br>leaching me to hope for pardon of all my offences<br>through the merits of Jesus Christ.<p>I return my grateful thanks to Mr. M'Kay<br>for the indulgence he allowed my friends in<br>in visiting me, and John  M'Dougal, the inner<br>keeper of the Jail, I cannot express his kindness<br>to me, being always ready to render me every<br>service in his power. I likewise return my most<br>sincere thanks to a Lady in the neighbourhood<br>who supplyed me with the necessaries of life in<br>a liberal manner, may the Lord reward them.<br>(Signed) MORT COLLINS.<br>JOHN M'DOUGAL., Inner-keeper, Witness.<p>O my God and Creator, the time of my de-<br>parture is at hand, and death presseth fore up-<br>on me. It summons me to appear before thy<br>dreadful tribunal; it frights me, when it brings<br>to my remembrance all my former sins, and re-<br>presents unto me the heinousness of my crimes.<br>O great God, when I seriously think what I am<br>and consider what thou art, I am astonished,<br>and the fight of thy Divine Majesty frieght me<br>for I am but dust and ashes, and my being is<br>less than nothing ; but thou art infinite in thy<br>Being and Glory ; the heaven is thy throne,<br>and the earth is thy footstool. I am clothed<br>with darkness, but thou dwellest in a light that<br>no man can approach into. How dare I that<br>am but convinced of sin, draw near unto thee,<br>who art the Holy of Holies, and Holiness itself<br>How can I that am but dry straw and stubble,<br>Hand before an everlasting burning ? O God of<p>God, if I did but see thee sitting upon the<br>throne of Glory, the Judge of thousand thou-<br>lands of immortal spirits waiting upon thee and<br>ten thousand milions worshipping thee ; if I did<br>see thee armed with thounder-bolts, encompa-<br>ssed with flames of fire, like to those of mount<br>Sinai ;I should not only be afraid, but I should<br>fall into despair, instead of drawing hear unto<br>thee, I should fly from thee as Adam and end-<br>eavour to hide myself from eyes, that can not<br>suffer the fight of evil ; I should cry oat as<br>Moses  I am afraid, that I tremble all over.<br>Or as the prophet Isaih, Woes is me, for I am<br>undone, because I am a man of unclean lips.<br>and I dwell in the midst of a people of unclean<br>lips, Ita. O&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  <p>If we had lived in the days when our Savour<br>was on earth  there is none of us but would<br>looked upon it as a singular happiness and hon-<br>our, to have been admitted with Peter, James,<br>and John, when he went up to mount Tabor,<br>to be eye witness of his transfiguration., A<br>far greater honour and happiness, Death is-<br>endeavouring to procure you ; it will usher you<br>up to mount Sion, it will transport me above all -<br>the heavens, where you shall behold more exce-<br>llent wonders than ever the apostles beheld up-<br>on mount Tabor; for you shall not only behold<br>that glorious Savour whiter than the snow, and<br>higher than the sun, but you yourself shall also<br>be transfigured with him, and clothed with<br>exceeding great glory. The holy aposties saw<br>but two prophets; but you shall see all the Pro-<br>phets, Patriarchs, Apostles, Consessors, Mar-<br>tyrs, the Holy and Blessed Virgin Mary, and<br>generally all the Saints that Reign and Triumph<br>in heaven. The Apostles had a sight of this<br>glory of our Saviour, as an slash of lightning it<br>continued with them but a moment, for soon<br>after they came down from the holy mountain,<br>and were again in the same temptations as before<br>and besieged by the same calamities.<p>For that purpose it is not necessary that we<br>should go put of the world, but that the world<br>should be banished, and driven out of us, and<br>that we should renounce all the vanities and un-<br>ruly affections, so that we may be able to speak<br>with the Apostle, the world is crticisied to me,<br>and I am crucified to the world.<p>O Holy of Holies when shall thy church be<br>so sanctified and cleansed,that no spot or wrinkle<br>or any such thing shall appear in it? When<br>shall I be decked with fine Linen, cloathed with<br>the Sun, and crowned with the Stars? When<br>shall my heart be as a Golden Vial, from<br>whence sweet perfume may ascend? When shall<br>I behold thy face continually? When shall I<br>love thee without interruption, and serve thee<br>without any bar or hinderance? When wilt<br>thou put into my hands a celestial harp, and<br>into my mouth the songs of the Blessed? And<br>when shall I worship thee in the company of all<br>the holy spirits without intermssion, and for<br>ever? When shall I sing forth thy praises in<br>heaven, O Lord, when shall I appear with the<br>holiness of thy saints, in the white robes of thy<br>Martyrs, and be as fiery as the Cherubims that<br>fly about thy glorious Throne 1 O my God<br>Let this holy Zeal which thou hast kindled in<br>my soul be like a fiery Chariot, and an holy<br>frame to carry me up to the Heavens of thy<br>glory where I am to shine in thy presence for<br>ever. Amen.<p>The above Speech was wrote by the Pannell's own hand, on the brink of eternity, what  <br>follows his signing was wrote by another hand, and given to J. GALBRAITH.to publish<p>His bahaviour at the place of execution with some other papers will be published.</p>
