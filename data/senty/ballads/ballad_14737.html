	<h2>Transcription</h2>
	<p> Account of that Cruel and Horrid Rape which was perpetrated<br>by a Man on a Woman on the Paisley Road, on SATUR-<br>DAY, and who was apprehended by a passenger on the<br>Road, and is at present lying in Paisley Jail. Also, an account<br>of another Cruel Rape, which was committed on a Girl, only<br>thirteen years of age, by a Writers Clerk, in Cnmberland<br>Street, Edinburgh, on Monday last, and for which he is also<br>apprehended, and is now lying in Jail.<p>On Saturday evening, a most audacious and horrid affair took<br>place on the Paisley Road. As a woman was proceeding on<br>her way to Paisley, and when a few miles on the Road, she was<br>overtook by a man, who accompanied her but a short space, till<br>a favourable opportunity should occur that he might accomplish<br>his brutal design. On arriving at a part of the road, where<br>there was an open field, he forced the unprotected woman into<br>it, and in the most wanton and savage manner, commenced his<br>brutal attack upon the chastity of the woman, who struggled<br>hard with the unprincipled ruffian. Her tears and entreaties<br>had no effect upon this brutal and cowardly monster; he was<br>callous to every tender feeling, which should distinguish a man<br>from a brute. At length her cries were heard by a man who<br>was travelling the road, who hastened to the spot from whence<br>the voice proceeded, and found the woman in a most pitiful<br>situation, nearly worn out with the struggle she had made, and<br>she now lies in a very alarming state. The villain attempted<br>to make his escape, but was secured by the activity and cour-<br>age of the man who came to her rescue, and, with some assist-<br>ance, had him safely lodged in Paisley Jail, where an investiga-<br>tion  is going on respecting this horrid and shameful affair.?<br>paisley, May 10th, 1830. <p>Another diabolical and cruel assault and rape was committed<br>on Monday evening, in a lodging-house in East Cumberland<br>Street, on a girl of 13 years of age, who was a servant in the<br>house. She accuses one of the lodgers, a writer's clerk, who<br>has, in consequence, been taken into custody, but strenuously<br>denied all knowledge of the crime. He has been examined by<br>the sheriff, and, we belive,  committed to jail, till liberated in<br>due course of law. The poor girl, we understand,  is very ill.<br>Edinburgh Mercury.<p>Serious crime is now increasing to an alarming extent, there be-<br>ing still two cases in Edinburgh, which are to be tried at Edin-<br>burgh in a short time; the one, the case of Stewart, the Police-<br>man and the other, the two carters, who committed murder,<br>rape, on the Edinburgh Road, near Gilmerton<br>and who behaved to the woman in such a shocking manner,<br>that  modesty would blush and tremble at its recital.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; W.
