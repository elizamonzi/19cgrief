	<p> A FULL AND PARTICULAR<p>ACCOUNT<p>OF A<p>Female  Miser!<p>Who Died at Stirling on the 26th of<br>May last, 1820 ; to which is added,<br>an Account of the numerous curious<br>Articles found in her House after<br>her Death.<p>ISOBEL FRIZZEL, or FRASER, died at Stirling on the 26th day<br>of May last.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She was about 75 years of age at the time of<br>her death, and had no relations, but dwelt alone in a house of three<br>apartments, into which no person was allowed to enter.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She enjoy-<br>ed good health, but denied herself the common necessaries of life,<br>except a little to satisfy her hunger, which was of the cheapest and<br>coarsest kind, but never applied for charity.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She  employed her<br>time in doing menial work for householders, and in spinning, but<br>went frequently about the  streets collecting  cinders.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She would<br>not even take away the ashes from the hearth, without extracting<br>every cinder to the size of a pin head, leaving nothing but the white<br>ash, which nearly suffocated her at the throwing it out on the dung-<br>hill, as there was no substance in it to  make it fall to the ground.<br>She carefully picked up every pin  she fell in with, till she nearly<br>filled one hundred pincushions, of which she appears to have had<br>an immense number.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She was fond of articles of dress, and bought<br>many, though she rarely put them on her back.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Old copper, brass,<br>iron, crystal, ropes, &c. and every commodity which could com<br>mand a market, she eagerly gathered  together, and  sold.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At the<br>time of her death, and after taking a particular view of the different<br>apartment of the house she occupied  in Stirling, the following is a<br>pretty correct statement of the principal  effects of her wardrobe,<br>though they are a numerous list of inferior trash :?<p>About 800 muslin and linen women's caps?120 gowns and<br>petucoats, of various descriptions, 14 of them silk?30 pair of<br>brass candlesticks?17 yetlen pots, and 5 copper tea-ketcles?250<br>wooden dishes, of various descriptions?2 house eight-day clocks<br>and cases?60 pewter dishes, with a variety of block-tin ones?80<br>pairs of shoes, many of them very old-fashioned?10 sets of fire-<br>irons, with a great many odd ones?150 shawls, of various quali-<br>ties?1 pair of coach lamps, and 7 lanterns?6 cart load of cinders<br>and firewood?700 articles of crockery and crystal ware?100 pin-<br>cushions, full of pins, of all sizes and colours?15 gold and silver<br>trinkets? 3 pair of silver tea-tongs?3 chests of drawers, in one of<br>which were found £7 and odds in money?8 silver tea-spoons,<br>cannister ditto, silver table and desert ditto?a washing boyn, full<br>of marbles?a boyn full of perries and tops?a boyn full of penny<br>dolls?a great variety of sheets and blankets?a number of linen<br>shirts and shifts,<p>With a number of horn spoons, rusty knives and forks, a variety<br>of potatoe beetles, a number of buttons, which had been cut off<br>old coats that came in her way, old copper, brass, and crystal, and a<br>variety of spades, hay-forks, rakes, grapes, two communion cups,<br>and a great variety of other articles, too numerous for our limits to<br>insert.<p>PRICE ONE PENNY.</p>
