	<p> A Full and Particular Account of that Funny and<br>Laughable WEDDING that took  place in Cross-<br>causeway, Edinburgh, on Tuesday Evening, the<br>15th March 1825, between a young Dashing High-<br>land Lad, and a well known Old Lady of that place.<p>THE following ludicrous circumstance excited an extraordinary<br> sensation in the Crosscauseway and neighbourhood, on Tues-<br>day evening, the 15th  March instant.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It appears that a young,<br>blooming, good looking lad, of the name of M' L?, a watchman,<br>of very captivating exterior, had, for a considerable period previous,<br>paid his addresses to a well known old Lady, a purifier of tripe, re-<br>siding in that place, (better known by another appellation, H??<br>M??,) who at length yielded to his ardent and pressing suit, and<br>Tuesday was mutually fixed on for the celebration of their nuptials.<p>The fair enamorate, in order, as it would seem, to ingratiate her-<br>self the more deeply into the good graces and favour of her future<br>Lord, impressed Twenty-five Sovereigns into his hands, in order,<br>she said, to make him appear very genteel on the occasion, and par-<br>ticularly to provide him with a new watch; a necessary appendage,<br>of course, to a gentleman. She also undertook to furnish a most<br>splendid marriage banquet, which was accordingly ordered, and to<br>which a great number of the friends, relations and acquaintances of<br>both parties were formally invited.<p>Accordingly, at the appointed hour, the company assembled, in<br>their gayest apparel, among whom were a great many Knights of<br>the baton, in fine trim. The modest blooming bride appeared<br>among the astonished natives, dressed in eastern splendour and<br>magnificence, the very silk gown worn by her on this happy occa-<br>ston, like the Laird of Dumbiedykes' mother's gowns, would stand<br>its lane on the floor, it was so rich, and the other parts of her costly<br>dress corresponded with the gown. She continued to grace the<br>happy assemblage with her presence, for a considerable time after<br>the hour appointed, smiling sweetly to some, and courtseying mo-<br>destly to others, in great good humour ; but of course, anxiously ex-<br>pecting the arrival of her happy lover, to crown her ardent wishes at<br>the hymeneal altar.<p>The clergyman having arrived about this time, to which the now<br>most anxious and impatient bride was introduced, but there was<br>still no word of Mr M'L?. The minister sat down beside the<br>bride, who encouraged her to hope, that her beloved partner would<br>soon make his appearance, and ease all her anxious doubts and fears,<br> which now became evident to the whole company. With some<br>pleasant chat, and the assistance of an occasional cordial glass now<br>and then, the reverend gentleman managed to prolong the pleasing<br>hopes of the arrival of the long expected bridegroom for several<br>hours after the time previously appointed ; but it was now become<br>pretty evident that Mr M'L------did not intend to make his appear-<br>ance at all; for he fairly absconded, as appeared from the following<br>laconic epistle, which was just handed to the despairing fair one.<p>Dear loveing beauty I do find, <br>My self to wedlock not inclin'd, <br>It is a thing so common.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>But for your sake a vow I'll make,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>To marry with no woman.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>It appeared  that Mr M'L------had  adopted the notion, that he<br>Your gold I'll spend,<br>With my true friend,<br>And drink your health so free,<br>So don't perplex, or yourself vex,<br>Farewell ! remember me !J.M'L.<p> would exhibit his finery to much more advantage upon the Highland<br>hills, than on the streets of auld Reekie.<p>The chagrin of the disappointed bride was now awful in the ex-<br>treme, but she could not still help but to encourage the pleasing hope,<br>that the bewitched enchanting man would not deceive her yet.  It<br>turned out otherwise, however; and the old lady fell into an awful<br>hysterical fit, from which a glass of good brandy was scarcely able<br>to recover her.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At last, finding herself really abandoned, and that<br>she could not better herself, she allowed herself to be put into good<br>spirits again, by repeated applications of strong water.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At her sug-<br> gestion, the party partook of their elegant and sumptuous supper,<br>consisting of every delicacy of the season, and the good old Lady<br>comforted herself for the loss of her false admirer, by repeated and<br> potent doses of Uisgebetha, mollified with hot water and sugar.<br>After supper, the catgut-scraper struck up a merry lilt, and they con-<br>tinued to trip it on the  light  fantastic toe till five o'clock in the<br>morning, when the bride went home, and had to go to bed again<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;alone,  which she reluctantly did, but still hoping that Mr M'L<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -----would yet relent, and speedly return to the fond and&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;longing<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;embraces of his dearly beloved M?&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<p>Printed for A. TURNBULL... Price One Penny.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  </p>
