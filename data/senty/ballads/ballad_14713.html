	<p> EXECUTION.<p>An account of the Execution of ALEXANDER  MILNE, who was<br>Hanged at Aberdeen on Friday the 27th August, for the<br>crimes of Stouthrief and Housebreaking. With the Speech<br>which he made to the Magistrates in prison, and the address<br>which he delivered to the numerous Spectators at the place<br>of Execution.<p>ABERDEEN, FRIDAY, AUG. 27, 1824.<p>THIS day ALEXANDER MARTIN, alias ALEXANDER MILNE, Was<br>Executed here, pursuant to sentence passed upon him by the High Court of<br>Justiciary, at Edinburgh on the 14th of July last. His crime was that of stouthrief<br>or masterly theft, as termed in law, i. e. overpowering or  depriving by force a man<br>of his property.<p>This atrocious act was committed by him in the parish of Kemnay, in Aberdeen-<br>shire, upon an old man and his daughter, into whose house he had forcibly entered<br>under circumstances of aggravation. He manifested a great degree of firmness and<br>resignation to his fate, fully acknowledging the justice of his sentence.<p>At 15 minutes before three the unfortunate criminal entered the Court House,<br>genteelly dressed in mourning, and accompanied by the Rev. Mr. Thom, Dr. Kidd,<br>and the Rev. Mr. Penman. He then returned thanks to the Lord Provost and Ma-<br>gistrates for the humane attention he had experienced during his confinement, as<br>hid to the above clergymen, the Rev. Mr. Lyon, and others, by whom he had been<br>visited, for their pious labours in promoting his spiritual interest. He also request- <br>ed his thanks to be publicly mentioned to Mr. George Tureff, Mr. Alex Brown,<br>jailor, John Gray, under turnkey, and Mr. John Fyfe, messenger, &c. a part of the<br>42d paraphrase was then sung, when Dr. Kidd having delivered a suitable prayer,<br>the unfortunate man Addressed the Lord Provost on the unhappy causes which had<br>brought him to such ignominy; among which he emphatically stated the evils result,<br>ing from his confinement in Bridewell, which he represented as productive of effects<br>on the minds of the miserable culprits there confined, widely different from those<br>intended, and which had in his case added to his guilt, and consequently to the<br>weight of his punishment.<p>About ten minutes past three he appeared on the scaffold; part of the 23d psalm<br>was sung, when the Rev. Mr. Thom delivered a servent prayer in his behalf, after<br>which the unhappy criminal, in a diftinct and audibie voice, without faltering or<br>hesitation, addressed the populace at great length, enlarging particularly on the to-<br>pics which had greatly engaged his attention during his confinement, namely, the<br>evils attending Sabbath breaking and bad company, and the ruinous tendency of<br>these derelictions of duty to youth in particular: above all, exhorting parents to en-<br>force the sacred obligations of religion on their children, so as especially to avoid<br>these fatal errrors from which he had to date all his misfortunes.<p>Having ascended the drop, he, after a short time employed in earnest prayer, gave<br>the signal about twenty minutes before four o'clock, when he was launched into an<br>eternal world; but suffered to appcrance very much for a short time, his body being<br>greatly convulsed.<p>After hanging the usual time, his body was cut down and delivered to his friends,<br>who had it soon after conveyed away in a temporary hearse for interment. He was<br>an athletic young man, seemingly 32 years of age.<p>A large body of special constables attended to preserve order, if necessary; but<br>the crowd, which was not very numerous, quietly dispersed, deeply impressed with<br>the awful scene they had witnessed.<p>John Muir, printer, Glasgow.</p>
