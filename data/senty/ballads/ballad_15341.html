	<p> Respite for a Month.<p>Copy Letter, relative to the Case of these three unfor-<br>tunate young Boys, CHARLES McLAREN, THOMAS<br>GRIERSON, and JAMES McEWEN, who were lately Sen-<br>tenced to be Executed at Edinburgh, on Wednes-<br>day the 12th February, 1823, for Housebreaking<br>and Theft ; but who have been Respited for one<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Month longer. <p>THE following very sensible and considerate Letter, relative to<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  the case of these unhappy young  boys, lately condemned to<br>be executed in  this City, for Housebreaking and Theft, is copied<br>from the Edinburgh Weekly Journal  of Wednesday the  22d of<br>January last ; and, we certainly concur in opinion with the writer,<br> "in viewing the  probable execution of this sentence with feelings<br>of deep regret, and of considering  the punishment of these boys<br>as arising in a great measure, if not wholly, from  the untoward<br>circumstances in which it has been their unhappy lot to be placed ;"<br>yet, the crimes for which they were convicted has  become of late<br>so very prevalent in  this place, and almost all, too, perpetrated by<br>youths&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; of&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;about&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;their age that an example, perhaps, has<br>become absolutely necessary.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We learn, however, that the Carlisle<br>Mail, which arrived in Edinburgh about mid-day  on  Monday the<br>10 th instant, brought a Respite to these unfortunate youths for one<br>month longer.<p>To the Editor of the Edinburgh Weekly Journal.<p>Sir....I observe from the newspapers, that a few days ago. several<br>boys, from thirteen to seventeen years of age, have been condemn-<br>ed to death in this city, for the crime of housebreaking and theft<br>and that in passing  sentence, the presiding Judge intimated to<br>two of them, that they were to expect no alleviation of the sentence.<br>Indeed, from the  crime having become very prevalent in this part<br>of the country, and from the circumstance of the public prosecu-<br>tor's having declined  to restrict the  libel to  an arbitrary punish-<br>ment, it is generally believed that it is intended to carry the dread-<br>ful sentence into execution,<p>I am far from being singular in viewing the probable execution<br>of this sentence  with feelings of deep regret,  and of considering<br>the punishment of these unhappy boys  as arising in a great mea-<br>sure, if not wholly, from the untoward circumstances in which it<br>has been their unhappy lot to be placed. Need I recapitulate the<br>history of such beings ? Born probably of vicious and depraved<br>parents, neglected in their education, placed among the most<br>worthless as companions, encouraged to pilfer by cunning and<br>unprincipled resetters, and not arrived at the period of life, when<br>the reasoning powers can enable them to counteract the errors of<br>their education,... they are brought to the gallows as mere victims<br>of misfortune, whose sate, can excite only pity and commisseration.<br>Is it therefore just, or consistent with the rules of enlightened<br>jurisprudence, to inflict upon such young and misguided creatures,<br>that punishment which is the doom of the murderer and assassin?<br>Severe as our laws have often been held in punishing with death<br>crimes short of murder, they contract a feature of barbarity when<br>enforced against persons of such tender years.<p>  I think it  unnecessary to enlarge on this matter.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My sole mo-<br>tive is to draw the  public attention to the case, and  in this way<br>  perhaps, to induce an application to be made for a commutation<br>of  the sentence, before it is too late.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am, &c.<p>AMICUS JUVENTUTIS.<p>Jan.,31, 1823.<p>We have heard,  with  great satisfaction, that these unfortunate<br>boys have behaved in the most becoming manner since their con-<br>demnation, and has given good grounds for believing that  they are<br>indeed striving for an interest in the atoning blood of a crucified<br>Saviour.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We sincerely pray, that they may obtain pardon for all<br>their manifold transgressions, that they may be supported through<br>life, and at death, by a firm reliance on the sufferings and merit of<br>the Redeemer of lost mankind, and ultimately&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;be  admitted  into<br>the kingdom of glory ; and though the best of earthly  Kings has,<br>very humanely, given orders for their lives to be prolonged for an-<br>other month in this world, we hope that they, as well as their wick-<br>ed companions, and others, will always remember, that they have<br>to render an account to the King of Kings, for their deeds and con-<br>duct while in this life.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Edinburgh....Printed for James McLean.</p>
