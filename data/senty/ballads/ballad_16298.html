	<p> The last<p><p>S P E E C H<p>Confession and dying Declaration of WILLIAM  TAYLOR, who<br>was executed at Stirling on Friday the 28th day of May 1790;<br>for the the crime of housebreaking.<p>I WILLIAM  TAYLOR,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;aged  about  23<br>years was born in Perth,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of honest and<br>creditable Parents who gave me an education<br>suitable to their circumstances, and gave good<br>and wholesome instructions. training me up in<br>the ways of virtue and religion, in short, had<br>I followed their counsels and advices, I would<br>not have come to this untimely and shameful<br>death.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  I  was  brought  up  to the Nailor<br>trade,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and served my apprentiship honestly<br>and faithfully, as my indentor testifies; after<br>my  said apprentiship was ended I thought<br>that a burden taken off me, and that I was<br>at liberty to do any thing when I was rid of<br>my Masters superintendency,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I therefore as-<br>sociated with the most disolute of the Trade<br>and such of them as were of a sober character,<br>I looked upon as mean spirited dunces and be-<br>low my notice,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;my parents and friends re-<br>monstrated with&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;me upon this mode of con-<br>duct in very strong and forcible terms, which<br>restrained me for some time from any outbreak-<br>ings, but when my parents were both dead I<br>thought that all restraint whatever was taken<br>away, never considering that I was still in the<br>presence of Almighty God whose omnicient<br>presence beholds all our most secret actions,<br>and is privy to our inmost thoughts;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;nor did<br>I ever hardly take time to reflect upon my<br>wicked life until  such time that I was com-<br>mitted to this prison for the heinous crime for<br>which I am to suffer an ignominous death.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I<br>need scarcely inform the reader that I could<br>not stay long in my native town of Perth by<br>reason of the many illicit practices I was for-<br>ced to carry on in order to support myself,<br>wherenpon I was forced to go several other<br>towns  to seek for work, at  length I grew<br>weary of working altogether and began to tra-<br>vel the country with a few goods, but finding<br>the product of that way of living too little to<br>support my former extravagancies, I began to<br>think of commencing highwayman, a business<br>which I thought would yield me plenty ; ac-<br>cordingly I began to lay my schemes, & being<br>in the house of Alexander Paton in St. Ninians<br>pairish selling some goods. I observed narow-<br>ly where he had his money in keeping, with<br>at intention of breaking his house and stealing<br>the money and whatever  other wearables&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I<br>was able; all which I put in practice that very<br>night when I thought they were quiet and a-<br>sleep, I had got money to the amount of 75l.<br>pounds sterling with several other things of<br>value with which I made off as fast as I could<p>and thought all was safe, however I was deceiv-<br>ed, for I was pursued, apprehended and cast<br>into prison, and am never to come from hence<br>until I come to expiate my crimes by suffering<br>the hardest sentence of the law; the just re-<br>ward of my crimes, they are more in number<br>than I can express, suffice to inform the cour-<br>teous Reader. there is not one commandment<br>in the Law of God which I have not broken;<br>only figure to your imagination a wretch re-<br>ceiving numberless blessings from my Crea-<br>tor and every moment experiencing his bounty<br>and goodness; and in stead of being grateful<br>to him for his kindness, endeavouring with all<br>my power to provoke him to wrath by still<br>heaping one execrable crime upon another,<br>breaking his sabbaths by rioting and daunk-<br>enness, blaspheming his holy name, and horid<br>to think, calling upon his name for damnation<br>to my soul, but I am unable to recite  the num-<br>ber of my sins or to paint them in their pro-<br>per collours, they are more in number than<br>the sand upon the sea shore and I am short-<br>ly to appear before Almighty God to answer<br>for these my numberless transgressions. O ! Al-<br>mighty and most gracious God seal the pardon<br>of them unto me with thine own blood before<br>I go hence and be no more that they may not<br>rise up in judgement against me, if I might<br>pesume to give advice, I would advise all<br>young persons to apply themselves with care<br>and attention to the Holy Sriptures, and at-<br>tending upon Gods ordinaces, and above all<br>to pray earnestly to God to give them grace<br>to guide them from evil, and add their honest<br>and best endeavours to live godly, righteons<br>and sober lives, it is of his mercy and goodness<br>that I was not cut of in the midst of my sins,<br>but have gotten some space to repeat, with<br>the wholsome advice and instructions of sever-<br>al good christians and worthy ministers, may<br>the Lord reward them for the care they have<br>taken for my soul. I have received great be-<br>nefit from them I crave forgivnness from all<br>whomever I offended, I freely forgive judges<br>and jury and all other persons acknowledging<br>the justness of my sentence and I hope the<br>Lord will forgive me , I die an unworthy<br>member of the church of Scotland, may the<br>Lord Jesus receive my spirit from the Gib-<br>bet.<p>WILLIAM TAYLOR.<p>Stirling&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tolbooth,<br>May 28th 1790.</p>
