General Agents and Undertakers of Lottery Prizes and<br>other Sales, late from Cork, and last from the Orkneys, challenge every other dealer in point of blank<br>verse, and rhyming metre, to rival them in ready made Epitaphs, Epigrams, Love Sonnets, Hymen-<br>eal Songs, Birth Day Odes, &c. all extemporary, on any subject, or in any verse, with any number<br>of feet, and to any or no tune but their own, composed for the occasion, at the very lowest prices,<br>aecording to the Employer's Income Tax. They also do business in prose, at next to nothing, for<br>Clergymen, Lawyers, and Quack Doctors, (by the piece or page's length,) and defy the meditated<br>misfortune of Bankruptcy, or fair Swindling; so much in fashion in this prospering country, to effect<br>their Funds, which are all insured at their own Office, at an extraordinary premium.<p>N.B. Persons on board wages, who are duly qualified by law, and by being already once unsuccess-<br>ful in a scheme of Bankruptcy, are on permanent duty, to be expediated as Sub-Agents, on foot, or<br>swift post-horses, as the exigency may require, of parties about to die, to be married, divorced, or to<br>have issue, who are licenced by us, to compose, or put together, suitable verses, from our manufac-<br>tory, for all such occasions, and to any length, for ready money only, or good Bills at a short date.<p>Price to Gentlemen, 2d. Tradesmen and Servants, 1d.?Edinburgh: Printed for the Author.</p>
