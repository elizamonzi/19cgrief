	<p> HUZZAH FOR AYTOUN !<p>A New Song.<p>TUNE?The Arethusa.<p>Come all Reformers brave and free,<br>All honest men come join with me,<br>And pitch your voice on the highest key,<br>To sins?Huzza for Aytoun !<br>He's a Reformer tried and true,<br>As ere stood forth to public view;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And before all eyes<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And without disguise,<br>The naked truth he plainly tells?<br>And allows the people to judge for themselves?<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Huzzah for honest Aytoun!<p>He tells us plainly he's not  rich,<br>Yet for places, pensions, and all sich,<br>Sooner than take he'd work in a ditch?<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Huzzah again for Aytoun!<br>And if there's a Whig that would do the some,<br>I for one would be glad to hear his name;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For look at the tricks<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of the Whig Year six,<br>And you'll see that as the curse of the public Purse,<br>Though the Tories are bad the Whigs are worse?<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  How different they from Aytoun !<p>And truly we need not go back so far<br>Plainly to see what these Whigs are,<br>For look at him of the English bar<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  That's set up against Aytoun !<br>Aytoun himself would hardly grudge&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>To pay an honest working Judge,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But a Job ? so base<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is such a disgrace,<br>That I wonder the Man can show his face<br>In the public streets of his native place,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  Much less contend with Aytoun !<p><br>Here's bottom, too, who for Leith would sit,<br>Heavy in person as in wit?<br>I greatly fear he must submit<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To be exposed by Aytoun :<br>And Bottom, when he's thus laid bare,<br>Will doubtless make his voters stare,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When they learn with surprise<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The cause of his size;<br>How through his whole life he's been fed from the Pipe +<br>Till now, at last, he fully is ripe<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  For the fearless hand of Aytoun !<p>The Whigs may hatch a nest of lies<br>Should danger to a friend arise,<br>And bid us not believe our eyes?<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  Not so with honest Aytoun !<br>For he, though be should stand alone,<br>Will never, like a Coward, disown<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The gloomy array<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of that sad day<br>When to the King's Park we went our way,<br>With banners unfurl'd, which, come what may,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Will never be denied by Aytoun.<p>Gibson and Co. in close divan,<br>May organise some new Whig plan,<br>All to pull down the People's Man,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  Yet the People will have Aytoun !<br>Each new " Whig clause" will prove in vain<br>While Aytoun in our heart shall reign ;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For he shall be sent<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To the new Parliament,<br>And vote for Reform to any extent,<br>So that many shall learn, to their cost, what is meant<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  When we cry, 'Huzzah for Aytoun m!'<p>* It  is well known, that the year 1806, during which the Whigs were in<br>power, was distinguished by a greater quantity of vile political JOBS<br>than any other period of equal lengh in British History.<p>? It can be necessary to state here the History of the late infamious Ex-<br>chequer Job, in favour or the Honourable James Abercromby. It is gen-<br>erally known in this city, and duly appreciated.<p>? It is perhaps not generally known, that John Archibald Murray, Esq.<br>commonly called B??, a Whig Reformer, and a sworn rnrmy of<br>sinecures, has held, for almost half a century, the valuable sinecure of<br>CLERK TO THE PIPe, an office conferred on him by that staunch Reformer,<br>the late Lord Melville.</p>
