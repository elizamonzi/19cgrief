	<p> SUSPECTED<p>MURDERS.<p><p>A Full, True, and Particular Account of the discovery of no less than<br>Four Dead Bodies, on Saturday last, in different parts of Edinburgh,<br>under violent suspicion of one or more of them having been mur<br>dered,-namely, the body of Alexander Kennedy, fifty.one years of<br>age, found in Hunter's Close, Grassmarket, with the full particu<br>lars of his death, the  apprehension of a man on suspicion, and a<br>precognition going on.?the finding of the body of a young  woman<br>in Princes Street, packed up in a box-the  finding of the&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; body of<br>an infant near the Canal Basin, with a stone bound to it by&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  awel<br>?and the finding of the body of another infant in the Canongate<br>Church Yard.<p>About one o'clock on Sunday morning, one of the watchmen in the<br>Grassmarket, found, in Hunter's Close, Grassmarket, the body of a<br>man, not  yet cold, but quite dead.<p>The body was immediately conveyed to the Police Office, and&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;sub<br>jected to medical inspection; but it was found that the vita! spark<br>had for ever fled.<p>The body was at once recognized to be that of Alexander Kennedy,<br>a sort of itinerant barber, well known to almost the whole population&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  <br>of the City,?he having been many years a drummer in the Edin-<br>burgh Gentlemen Volunteers. He was afterwards a Serjeant in, the<br>Army, but for many years past he has again resided in this City, in the<br>enjoyment of a pension.<p>The deceased was fifty one years of age, and lodged in a house in<br>Aird's close, Grass'market, which is the next close east from that in<br>which the deceased was found lying dead-<p>There were found in the pockets of the deceased, nothing but-an<br>old razor and a little tobacco.<p>From the most careful information we have been able to collect,, it<br>appears that the  deceased had been drinking during a great part of<br>Saturday in the premises of a Spirit Dealer, near to the spot in which<br>his dead body was afterwards discovered-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He was seen in that situa-<br>tion during periods of the day by some of his fellow lodgers and other<br>persons and it is alleged that at night he was seen lying his back<br>drunk and asleep, on the floor of the Spirit dealer's premises-<p>While  the  unfortunate man&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;was in this  helpless, and (from the<br>quantity of strong drink be had already swallowed), dangerous condi<br>tion, it seems that a man had been at once so brutal and so imprudent,<br>as to pour into his&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;mouth a further quantity of spirits,? mixed, it is<br>said, with another fluid of a disgusting nature  and which decency for.<br>bids to be named.<p>Whether the unfortunate man died very soon after this, and while<br>he was Still lying on the floor of the premises in Which, he had been<br>drinking,?and whether, after being asccrtained. be dead, he was<br>then carried out of the spirit shop, and laid down in the situation in<br>which he was found,?or whether he was still alive, or was supposed<br>to be still alive, when he was carried out, --or whether he had been<br>subjected to any further ill usage than that of pouring the whisky,<br>&.C-, into his mouth,?are, points that are not yet perfectly deter-<br>mined.<p>The authorities, however, immediately instituted the most prompt .<br>and careful investigation into the circumstances of the case.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At so<br>late an hour as ten o'clock "last night, the Sheriff and  Captain Stuart<br>were on the spot, inquiring into the facts of the case ; and a precogni- ?<br>lion will be. taken before the Sheriff this day-<p>There being circumstances of suspicion about this painful and rather<br>mysterious affair, an individual was ordered to be taken into custody,<br>last night, and to abide the consequences of the legal investigation<br>which is now; giving on.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<p>By those who saw the body of the deceased, when it was laid out,<br>we are informed that it appeared to be that of a person who had<br>previously been" in perfect health, -being, though' not tall, strongly<br>formed, and fat There was a flush on the countenance, as if the blood<br>had been impelled in to the head by suffocation. The features, however,<br>were remarkably composed and placid.<p>The body of an infant, under still stronger circumstances of suspi.<br>oion than those attending the death of poor Kennedy, was found on<br>Saturday in Grove-street, or Wellington-street, near the Canal Basin.<br>There was nothing upon this body except a towel wrapped round its<br>middle ;?and (very suspiciously) a stone was found between the<br>towel and the body, pressing on the abdomen.?The remains of the<br>helpless infant were conveyed to the Police Office, -where they still<br>remain.<p>On Saturday, also, a coffin containing the body of a dead infant was<br>found in the Canongate Church Yard, about two o'clock. It is sup-<br>posed to have been thrown into the Church Yard, over the wall.<p>And, on Saturday forenoon, upon the arrival of one of the Glasgow<br>coaches, the Policeman on duty ascertained that a box brought into<br>the city contained a dead body. He also recognized,, in one of the<br>persons loitering about, a well known Glasgow resurrectionist. The<br>resurrectionist he immediately apprehended ; and he employed a por-<br>ter to carry the box and its contents to the Police O.hce. The body<br>was found to be that of a stout young woman with red hair.. Decom-<br>position of the body has proceeded so far, that its smell is very ob<br>noxious. It still remains at the Poli e Office, with the bodies of Ken-<br>nedy, and the infant found near the Canal Basin. The resurrectionist<br>Having denied all knowledge of the matter, was of course set at liberty.<p><p>Forbes and Owen Printer,118 High street.</p>
