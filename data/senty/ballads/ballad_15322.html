	<p> The whole Particulars of the Trial of Mr James<br>Stuart, before the High Court of Justiciary on<br>Monday the 10th June 1822, for being concerned<br>in the Fatal Duel on the 26th March last, when<br>Sir Alexander Boswell was mortally&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;wounded, and<br>died the following day.<p>This day came on the trial of Mr James Stuart. indicted for shooting<br>Sir A. Boswell in a duel on the 26th of March 1822. Mr Stewart ap-<br>peared at the bar, attended by the Earl of Moray, Mr Erskine of Card-<br>ross, Lord Loughborough and a few more-friends. He plad not guilty.<p>Mr Cockburn made a most clear and able speech on the part of Mr<br>Stewart, in which he stated that upon a Saturday Mr Stewart was walk-<br>ing in the Parliament house, when he was addressed by person who<br>introduced himself as the private agent of Borthwick.  He told Mr<br>Stewart that Borthwick was willing to give up the paragraphs against<br>Mr Stewart in order to screen himself. Mr Stewart went to Glasgow,<br>he did not know that Borthwick had no right to give up these papers.<br>If Mr Stuart had not accepted of that offer of ascertaining the author,<br>he would be again attacked as the mean fellow, &c. Mr Stuart had no<br>communication with Borthwick, he did not pay the debt for which he<br>was incarcerated. Mr Stuart discovered on gaining possession of  the<br>papers, that Sir Alexander Boswell, a person whose talents he admired,<br>and who was distantly related to him; was the author of these libellons<br>paragraphs, Mr stuart made two propositions to Sir Alexander, one to  <br>deny that he was the author of the song; he  admitted of being the au-<br>thor, The other was that Sir Alexander should' say he was sorry for it,<br>that it was a squib, and would be friends. Sir Alexander's answer was,<br>I cannot submit to be catechised. A meeting took  place, and both<br>parteis fired at the same time. Mr Stuart gave notice to the crown office<br>that whenever he was wanted he would deliver himself up.<p>A number of witness were examined, but the principal evidence was that the<br>Earl of Rosslyn, who had acted as second to Mr Stuart, and  Hon. John Douglas,<br>second to sir Alex. Boswell.<p>Earl of Roslin.?I was acquainted  with the late Sir A. Boswell, I was employed<br>in a message between them on the 25th of March last.  I saw  Sir Alexander on that<br>day, in consequence  of a note which I had written to him, requesting permission to<br>see him; and I stated to him that I came at the desire of Mr Stuart . I also stated<br>to him that Mr Stuart had been in possession of several paper, some of which ap-<br>peared to be in Sir A. Boswell's hand ,writing  and having been sent by the post,<br>bore the post-mark of Mauchline and of Glasgow ; That there papers were address-<br>ed to the editor of the Sentinel ; some of which were original, and printed in that<br>newspaper : That one of them, particularly A  song, contained matter most injurous<br>to Mr Stuart's character, charging him with cowardice : That the similarity of<br>of hand-writing, together with the circumstance of the post mark, formed so strong<br>a presumption that these papers had been sent by Sir A. Boswell, that Mr Stuart<br>thought himself entitled to ask Sir Alexander whether he was the author of them :<br>I stated, at the same time, that if Sir Alexander could say that he was not the author<br>of those papers, such denial on his part would be conclusire against any evidence<br>The explanetion was particularly asked for the song. In two passages it contained<br>a direct imputation of cowardice. I examined these papers,....They were now pre-<br>sented to his Lordship, and he recognized them. I saw Mr Stuart, and proceeded<br>immediately to Mr Douglas, and stated that I was grieved to find that no alterna--<br>tive was left to Mr Stuart. Mr Brougham staled to me (at half past 8, at Dysart)<br>that Sir A. Boswell and Mr Stuart, had been bound over in the course of the night.<br>by the Sheriff of Edinburgh, to keep the pence within that county and city; and<br>that in consequence of that proceeding. it had been settled during the night, that<br>Sir Alexander and Mr Stuart should meet at Auchtertoul that morning, and desir-<br>ing me to meet Mr Stuart, which I did. I met Mr Douglas in the inside of the<br>coach, we had some conversation. We fixed upon a piece of ground, in a field by<br>the road side. Mr Stuart and Sir Alexander arrived in carriage, and got out at<br>the place appointed, (I believe 12 o'clock was the time.).......Mr Douglas received<br>from me the measured powder for each, and the ball, and rammed them down.<br>There were but two pistols, of which Mr Douglas took one, and I took the other,<br>The ground was measured first, immediately after loading the pistols, at 12 very<br>long paces. The distance was intimated to the two parties by Mr Douglas, and by<br>me  and it was agreed that  they should fire sogether by our word. They both fired,<br>and Sir Alexander fell. Every possible assistance was afforded to Sir Alexander<br>by the medical attendants, and no time was lost in removing Sir Alexander to Bal<br>muto.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<p>The examination of the Hon. John Douglas was nearly the same as the above.<p>Mr Jeffrey stated that the evidence for the defender was closed : and the Lord<br>Advocate in a short but distinct speech stated, that he had considered it to be his<br>bounden duty to bring this case to trial. Mr Jeffrey made a very long argumentative<br>speech ; he spoke for nearly three hours. The Lord Justice Clerk commenced his<br>Charge to the Jury at three o'clock?A more distinct, candid, and important charge,<br>we venture to assirm, has seldom been heard within the walls of a Criminal Court.<p>The Jury chose Sir John Hope, Bart, as their chancellor , and after consulting for<br>a few minutes in the Jury box, the chancellor delivered an unanimous verdict of<br>Not Guilty- The verdict was received with loud cheers from without the doors,<br>and with marked approbation from those within. <p>The trial lasted  eighteen hours, and was not finished till near five the this morning.</p>
