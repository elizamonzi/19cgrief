	<p> EXECUTION.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<p>Account of the Behaviour since his condemnation, and on the<br>Scaffold, of JOHN M'CREEVIE, who was Executed at<br>Glasgow, on Wednesday the 2d of June, 1824, for House-<br>breaking and Theft at Springvale, with a solemn warning<br>to his companions, and those who, like him, are running a<br>course, which leads to an awful death.<p>Glasgow, 2d June, l824.?This day,John M'Creevie, who was respited 14 days,<br>underwent the awful sentence of the law, for the crime of House breaking and<br>Theft, a few months ago, in the house of Mr Shephard, Springvale;  the prisoner<br>entered the house in the middle of  the night while the family were at rest, and<br>aggravated the case,  by threatening them with personal violence if they offered to<br>resist and protect their own property, which he actually put in force, by striking<br>Mr Shepherd with an iron bar, which greatly injured his arm, to the terror of his <br>family, and of all who wish to sit peaceably under their own vine and fig tree ; he<br>likewise carried off a quantity of articles, and for all of which he was found Guilty.<p>Since the time of sentence he has, behaved himself in a very becoming  and com-<br>posed manner; reading frequently ; hearing  instuctions attentively; weighing his<br>past days and crimes seriously, and looking forward to his future prospects with a <br>hope, that after his sufferings are over here, he will through the merits of his<br>Saviour, be a candidate for enjoying true felicity hereafter.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When the respite of<br>14 days was announced to him, (in order to investigate some reports which had been<br>spread concerning his case, and which proved without foundation), no doubt hope<br>Cast a glimmering ray  into his sorrowful  heart, and animated him with the thought<br>that he would escape the ignominy of a public execution ; but how delusive are<br>the most sanguine hopes which even the best of men entertain ; they are blasted<br>in a moment, and are succeeded by the most horrid views the imagination can<br>conceive.What were the feelings of this unfortunate man, on receiving the secon'd<br>summons to prepare for death, baffles description ; a man at the highest pinnacle<br>of hope, thrown down to the lowest depth of despair ; we would consider It enough<br>to alter the mind of many a rational being in regard to his worldly affairs, and what<br>must have been its effect upon the man who this day suffered, we leave humanity<br>to judge.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The contest was severe, but he supported himself for the few rem aining<br>days, with uncommon fortitude and perfect resignation.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Several Ministers of the<br>city attended him during his confinement,and aided him in his devotional exercises,<br>and,gave him every comfort which lay in their power; to them, and to the super-<br>intendents of the prison, he expressed his warmest gratitude, for the kind treament<br>he had received from them.<p>About two o'clock he entered the Hall, where the Magistrates,.and Ministers<br>were in attendance; they then proceeded.to the last solemnities of praying for him,<br>reading portions of scripture for his comfort at that trying hour, and singing praises <br>to Him, who alone could unsting Death of his terrors, and lead him in safety thro'<br>the dark valley and shadow of death. He then proceeded to the fatal drop, in a<br>very composed manner, and decently attired, and after spending. a few minutes in<br>servent prayer on the confines of eternity, he gave the signal, and after a few con-<br>yulsive throws, his connexion with this world ceased.<p>He was about 30 years of age, and has left a wife and two children.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He was<br>born in the north of the city, where he wrought at various, employments ; some<br>time as a weaver ; at another, at the Monkland Basin, and in the boats which ply<br>with coals and lime on the Monkland Canal; 'he was also a short time in the army.<p>The case here narrated, ought to be viewed by the idle and profligate with due <br>attention; they should keep continually in mind that the next example may be<br>some of themselves, if they continue their present course of iniquity and crime.?<br>We must here observe, that a most numerous class of young and old are now often<br>deprived of gaining an honest livelihood by selling various commodities upon the<br>streets ; the young cannot get trades ; the aged are unfit Tor employment ; and<br>the blind cannot see, nor the lame walk; upon their industry, several thousands<br>depend for support, when we include their children.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Deprived of the means of<br>gaining subsistence, what are we to expect, but that they and their children must<br>Steal ,to prevent starvation ; and were it fairly considered, we doubt not, but every<br>person would be allowed to gain an honest livelihood; were this the case, it would<br>prevent a number of crimes.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  W. Carse, Printer.</p>
