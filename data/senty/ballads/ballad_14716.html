Also, the names of<br>several respectable Manufacturers who were to have been<br>assassinated, for which he was to receive £100.<p>On Friday night, the Report of the Committee of the House of Commons on the<br>Combination Laws, was laid before the House, from which the following Confes-sion<br>of the culprit Kean is extracted; it is worthy of remark it is dated the day<br>before he was whipped. '<p>Mr. Wm.

The Committee met at one time in the house of Peter<br>M'Arthur, King, Street, Glasgow ; and since M'Arthur left King; Street, they meet<br>in W.
