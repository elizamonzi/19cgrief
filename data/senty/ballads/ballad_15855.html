	<p> Christs Kirk on the Green,<p>Composed (as is supposed)  by King James V.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Newly Corrected,<br>according to the Original Copy.<p>WAS never in Scotland heard nor seen<br>such Dancing not Deray,<br>Neither on foulkland on the Green,<br>nor feebies at the  play ;  <br>As was of Wooers as I ween<br>at Christs kirk  on a day:<br>For there came  kittie washen  clean ;<br>with her now Gown of  Gray,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Full gay that day.<p>To Dance  these damosels them dight ,<br>these Lassos light of laits ,<br>Their Gloves were of the Raffal right ,<br>their shoes were of the straits ,<br>Their Kartles were of  Lincoln light ,<br>well drest  with  many plaits , <br>They were so nice when Man them neigh'd ,<br>they squiel'd  like any Gaits.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Full loud that day<p>Of all these Maidens mild as meed,<br>was none so gimp at oillie ;<br>As  any Rose her rude was red,<br>her Lure was like the Lillie,<br>But yellow, yellow was her Head,<br>and she of  Love so silly,<br>Though  all  her  Kin had sworn her dead,<br>she would  have  none  but Willie&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alone that day. <p>She scorned at Jack ,and scripp'd him ,<br>and murgenn'd him with mocks;<br>He would have lov'd her, she would not let<br>for all his yellow locks;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(him,<br>He cherisht her, sHE bad go chat  him,<br>she courted him not two cloaks, <br>So shamefully his short Jack set him,<br>his Legs were like two Rocks,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of Rungs that day.<p>Tom Lutter was their  Minstral&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;meet,<br>good Lord, how he could lance, <br>He play'd so shril, and sang so sweet, <br>while Tousie took a Tranoe :<br>Old Lightscots here be could forelet<br>and counter fitted France :<br>He held him like a man disceret,<br>and up the Morice dance .&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He took that day.<p>Then Stephen came stapping in with stends,<br>no Rink might him arrest,<br>Splayfoot did  bob with many bends,<br>for Masie he made Request.<br>He lap while he lay on his lends,<br>and rising was so preast,<br>While he did boast at both the ends,<br>for honour of the Feast,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And danc'd that day<p>Then Robin Roy began to Reval,<br>and Tousie to him drugged :<br>Let be quoth Jack, and call'd him Jevel,<br>and by the  Jail him Rugged :<br>Then Kensie Clicked to a Kevel,<br>God wots as they two lugged,<br>They parted there upon a Neval,<br>Men say their hair was tugged<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Between them two.<p>With that a Friend of his ery'd Fy,<br>and forth an Arrow draw,<br>He forged it so sorcefully,<br>the Bow in flenders  flew,<br>Such was the Grace of GOD, trow I,<br>for had the Tree been true,<br>Mensaid, who knew his Archery,<br>that he had slain a  new,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Belyale that day.<p>A Yap young man that stood him niest,<br>soon bent his Bow in ire,<br>And Etled the Brain in at the Breast,<br>the Belt flew o're the Bire,<br>And cry'd Fy, he had slain a priest ,<br>a mlls beyond the mire:<br>Both Bow  and  bag  from  him  he  keist<br>and fled as fast as Fire<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From flint that day.<p>An Basly kins-mancalled Hary,<br>that was an Archer Keen,<br>Tyed up a Tackle without tarry;<br>I trow the Man was tane:<br>I wote not whether his hand did vary,<br>or his Foe was his Friend,<br>But he escaped by the Mights of Mary,<br>as one that nothing mean'd, <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But good that day.<p>Then  Lawrie  like  a  Lyon  lap ,<br>I and soen a flain could sedder,<br>He height to pierce him at the pape,<br>thereon to wed a Wedder,<br>He hit him on the wimb a wap, <br>It bust like any bladder,<br>He 'seaped so, such was his hap,<br>his dowblet was of leather.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Full fine that day.<p>The buss so boisterously a baist him;<br>that he to the Earth Cusht down,<br>The other man for dead he left him,<br>and fled out of the Town;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>The Wives came forth,and up they rest him<br>and found life in the Lown,<br>Then with there routs there they rais'd him,<br>and Cur'd him out of sound,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Free band that day.<p>The Miller was a Manly Make ,<br>to meet with him it was no moves.<br>There durst not ten some there him take,<br>so cowed he their power:<br>The bushment whole about him brake,<br>and bickared him with bows<br>Then traiterously behind his back;<br>they hoch'd him on the howes;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Behind that day<p>Then Hutchen with a Hazel Rice,<br>to red gan through them rummil;<br>He muddl'd them like any M ce<br>he was no batty bummil:<br>Though he was wight he was uot wise,<br>with such Jutters to jummil,<br>For from his thumb there flew a slice <br>while he cry'd barlasummil,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I'm slain this day.<p>When that he saw his blood was red,<br>to flee might no man let him:<br>He trom'd it bad been for old seed,<br>he thought and bad have at him.<br>He made his feet defend his head,<br>the far fairer it set him,<br>While he was past out of their plead,<br>They must be swift that gat him,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Through speed that day,<p>Two that were headsmen of the Herd,<br>they rusht on other like Rams,<br>The other four that were ungear'd,<br>beat on with barrow Tram;<br>And where their Gobs were ungear'd'<br>they got  apon the Gams;<br>While that all bloody was their heards,<br>as they had worried Lambs,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Most like that day.<p><br>They girn'd and glowred all at anes,<br>each Gossip other grieved,<br>Some striked stings some gathered stanes<br>some fled, and some relieved,<br>The Minstrels used  quiet means,<br>that day he wisely prieved,<br>For  he came bame with  mob mis'd, banes,<br>where fighters were mischieved,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Full ill that day.<p>With Forks and Flails they lent them flaps,<br>and flew together like Frigs,<br>with bougers of Barns they pierce'd blew cap,<br>and of their Bairns made Brigs,<br>The Rarerose rudly with their Eaps,<br>then Rungs were laid on Rigs :<br>The Wives came fourth with cryes and claps,<br>See where my Liking ligs,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Full low that day.<p>The black soutter of Braith was bowden,<br>his wife hang at his waist,<br>His body was in black all browden,<br>he girn'd like any Ghaist ,<br>Her glittering Hair was so bowden ,<br>her Love fast from him laist,.<br>That for his sake she was Unyawden,<br>while he a mile was chaste,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And mair that day.<p>When they had bair'd like baited Balls,<br>the Bone Fires barot  like bails,<br>Then they grew as meek as mules,<br>that wearled with Mails,<br>For those foresoughten tyred Fools<br>fell down like slaughtered Frails,<br>Fresh Men came in and hail'd the Dools,<br>and dang them down in dails,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bedeen that day.<p>The wives then gave a hideous yeil,<br>when all these Yonkiers yoked,<br>As fiarce as flags of Fire flaughts sell,<br>fricks to the field they flocked.<br>The Carles with clubs did others Quel<br>on breast  while blood out boaked;<br>So rudely Ring the Common Bell,<br>that  all the steeple
