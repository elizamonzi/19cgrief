	<p> EXECUTION.<p>An account of the Execution of these two<br>unfortunate men James Anderson and<br>David Glenn at Ayr, on Friday the<br>12th Dec. Their bodies were brought<br>into the College this morning for dis-<br>section.<p>Ayr, 12th December, 1823. This day were executed ac-<br>cording to their sentence, James Anderson and David Glen,<br>who were tried and found Guilty, before the High Court of<br>Justiciary, at Edinburgh, on the 5th Nov. last, for the mur-<br>der of John M'Clure, a respectable elder, as he was returning<br>from Ochiltree Sacrament on the 6th day of July 1823.<p>The behaviour of these unfortunate men since their con-<br>demnation has been very becoming their awful situation;<br>they paid great attention to the instructions rendered them<br>by the clergymen and pions persons who visited them. They<br>often spoke with regret of the loss which the family of the<br>deceased has sustained by the commission of the iuhuman<br>deed. They were visited some days previous to the Execu-<br>tion by some friends, their parting with whom was most<br>affecting.<p>Shortly after their condemnation, they sent up a petition<br>to his Majesty, for a mitigation of their punishment; but<br>they received an answer from the secretary of state, saying,<p>that upon considering the nature of their case, he could not<br>lay their petition before his majesty. They received the an-<br>swer with fortitude, and becoming resignation; and seemed<br>to forget that love of life which they some days  back anxious-<br>ly wished for. They applied with redoubled solicitude to<br>learn and understand fully the parts of scripture, most appli-<br>cable to their case, which had been selected and pointed out<br>by some pious well-wishers. We understand that they both<br>gave some wholesome and serious advices, through the me-<br>dium of an acquaintance, to the two young women who were<br>present at the murder, and tried along with them, beseeching<br>them to make their awful fate a warning for their future con-<br>duct,?it fete which they (the prisoners) were happy the two<br>females had so providentialy escaped from.<p>The magistrates assembled in the Hall about two o'clock,<br>and the prisoners being brought down, they joined very fer-<br>vent in the devotional exercises that was put up in their be-<br>half. They then proceeded to the scaffold, and one of the<br>clergymen put up a most impressive prayer for them, a psalm<br>was then sung, and the unhappy men stepped with firmness<br>to the drop. They hoped that the surrounding multitude<br>many of them once their intimate acquaintances, would be-<br>ware of drunkenness, as drunkenness was really the root of all<br>evil, and expected that their shameful end would be a warn-<br>ing to both old and young, The executioner having adjust-<br>ed the ropes, they were observed to pray inwardly for a few<br>minutes, and then dropt the signal,?in a few minutes they<br>were not of this world.<p>It is hoped that the solemnity of this awful scene, will<br>make a lasting impression on the minds of the numerous as-<br>semblage that witnessed it, and refrain from drinking, as it<br>was this alone that occasioned these two young men io com-<br>mit the horrid crime for which they have this day justly suff-<br>ered.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
