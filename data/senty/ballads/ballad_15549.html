	<h2>Transcription</h2>
	<p> A particular account of the Execution of JOHN CRAIG and JAMES<br>BROWN, who were executed at Paisley, on Thursday the 29th of<p>OCtober, 1829 for the crime of Stoutrief.<p>YESTERDAY, JOHN CRAIG, glazier, and JAMES BROWN,<br>labourer, were executed in front of the Court Houses in<br>Paisley, for the crime of stouthrief. It may be remembered that<br>men were convicted at our last Circuit Court of breaking into the<br>house of William Robertson, bleacher at West Foxbar, in the<br>Vbbey parish of Paisley, on the morning of the 14th June last;<br>and after having overcome the resistance of Mr Robertson and his<br>sister, by various acts of violence and threats of murder, they<br>robbed the house of different articles of valuable property ; and<br>previous to leaving the premises, bound the proprietors with ropes<br>to prevent them from giving any alarm. An accomplice of the<br>name of Robert Stewart, a weaver, was outlawed for not appearing.<br>From the period of their condemnation, the deportment of Craig<br>and Brown was befitting the awfulness of their situation. Feeling<br>they had no hope whatever in this world, they apparently gave<br>themselves wholly up to the things of the next, and listened to the<br>gifferent religious instructors who visited them with the most an-<br>xious and earnest desire to profit by their advice and instruction.<p>During their imprisonment in the Jail of Paisley, the families of<br>the prisoners had frequent interviews with them, the last of which<br>took place on Wednesday ; and when we mention that Craig had<br>a wife and three children, and Brown a wife and seven children to<br>Dart with for the last time in this world, it will rcadily be con-<br>ceived that the scene which took place was of the most overwhelm-<br>ing and heart-rending description. During the night preceding the<br>exeution, and indeed during the whole period of their conflne-<br>ment, the unfortunate men were most assiduously attended by their<br>religious instructors, who did every thing in their power to impress<br>their minds with the necessity of deep, sincere, and humble repen-<br>tance....and if a person might judge of their spiritual improvement<br>from the expressions of thankfulness and gratitude for these hu-<br>mane individuals, there was every reason to hope that they had not<br>laboured in vain.<p>On the morning of the execution, the men slept for about two<br>hours each ; and during night they were frequently engaged in<br>prayer for themselves their wives and families ; Brown was at one-<br>time greatly affected, but gradually recovered that composure which<br>he, as well as his companion, had all along maintained. By a<br>quarter to 12 o'clock they had been pinioned, at which period, J.<br>C. Dunlop. Esq. Sheriff-depute of Renfrewshire, Alex. Campbell,<br>Esq, Sheriff-depute accompanied by the Provost and Magistrates of<br>Paisley, bearing their rods of office, entered the day-room of the<br>prison, when Craig and Brown followed, and were seated at the<br>lire. The Rev Mr Telfer and the Rev. Mr Geddes then offered up<br>fervent prayers in their behalf, and that of their destitute families.<p>After this had been done, and the blessing pronounced, Craig<br>and Brown proceeded to the scaffold, (the former leaning on the<br>arm of the Rev. Mr Symington, the latter on that of the Rev.<br>Mr Goddes) which they ascended with all that firmness and<br>composure which their previous behaviour indicated.<p>When the executioner had adjusted the ropes, and the caps<br>were drawn over the faces of the unhappy men, Mr Symington<br>again pronounced a most emphatic prayer in their behalf, after<br>which Craig and. Brown shook hands with each other, and with<br>those gentlemen who were near them, when, every thing being<br>ready, the signal was placed in the hands of Brown, who, after-be-<br>ing engaged in prayer for two minutes, enquired of Craig twice if<br>he was ready, and being answered in the affirmative, the signal was<br>given at half-past twelve, and the drop instantly fell. The suffer-<br>ings of Brown appeared to be brief, but the body of Craig was<br>much convulsed for some minutes.<p>Previous to coming so Johnstone, (where he had only a twelve-<br>month, working as a labonrer, which he continued to do till about<br>a fortnight prevlous to the perpetration of the crime for which he<br>sufferd) Brown kept an inn in Newtonards, Ireland, in which line<br>he was unfortunate. Craig had resided in Johnstone for a period<br>of nine  year.<p>Since the days of witchcraft, there  have been only three melan-<br>choly exhibitions of this nature in Paisley; and it is not a little re-<br>markable that the precise period  of thirty-two years should have<br>elapsed betwixt each of them, as appears from the following list:....<br>A Provan, weaver, (a  most  notorious villoin,) for murdering his<br>wife, was executed on the 7th November, 1765, at the Gallow-<br>green,on the Glasgow Fast-day, and his right hand struck off;<br>Thomas Potts, Weaver, on the 17th August, 1797, for housebreak<p>ing and robbery at Gryffe Castle, Craig and Brown in Oct 1829.</p>
