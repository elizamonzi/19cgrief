	<p> A Horse Chesnut and a<br>Chesnut Horse.<p>PRICE ONE PENNY.<p>Copies of this popular recitation can always be had in Poet's Box<br>All kinds of Music supplied to order on moderate terms.<p><p>An Eton stripling, training for the law,<br>A dunce at syntax-but a dab at taw,<br>One happy Chrismas laid upon the shelf,<br>His cap, and gown, and store of learned pelf,<br>With all the deathless bards of Greece and Rome,<br>To spend a fortnight at his uncle's home.<br>Arriv'd, and pass'd the usual How-d'ye-do's,<br>Inquiries of old friends, and college news.<br>"Well, Tom, the road-What saw you worth discerning?<br>And how goes study, boy?-What are you learning?"<br>"Oh! logic, sir; but not the common rules<br>Of Locke and Bacon-antiquated fools!<br>'Tis wit and wranglers logic! Thus d'ye see<br>I'd prove at once, as plain as A, B, C,<br>That an eel-pie's a pigeon!-To deny it,<br>Would be to swear black's white."-"Come, let's try it."<br>"An eel-pie is a pie fish."-" Agreed."<br>"A fish pie may be a jack-pie." " Well, proceed."<br>"A jack-pie must be a john-pie-thus it's done,<br>For every john-pie must be a pi-geon!"<br>"Bravo!" Sir Peter cried, "logic for ever!<br>That beats my grandmother, she was clever,<br>But hold, my boy! it surely is too hard,<br>That wit and learning should have no reward;<br>To-morrow, for a stroll, the park we'll cross,<br>And there I'll give thee, boy, a chesnut horse,"<br>"A horse!" quoth Tom-" blood, pedigree, and paces!<br>Oh! what a dash I'll cut at Epsom races!"-<br>To bed he went, and wept for downright sorrow,<br>To think the night must pass before the morrow,<br>Dreamt of his boots and spurs, and leather breeches,<br>His hunting whips, and leaping rails and ditches:<br>Left his warm rest an hour before the lark,<br>Dragg'd his old uncle fasting through the park.<br>Bridle in hand, each vale he scours of course,<br>To find out something like a chesnut horse;<br>But no such animal the meadow cropt;<br>At length, beneath a tree, Sir Peter stopt,<br>Who reach'd and shook a bough, when down there fell,<br>A fine horse chesnut in its prickly shell.<br>"There, Tom take that!"-"Well, sir, and what beside?"<br>"Why, since you're booted, saddle it, and ride!"<br>"Ride what!-A chesnut?"-" Ay, come, get across,<br>I tell you, Tom, that chesnut is a horse!<br>And all the horse you'll get, for I can show,<br>As clear as sunshine, that 'tis really so.<br>Not by the musty, fusty, worn-out rules<br>Of Locke or Bacon-addle-headed fools!<br>All maxims but the wrangler's I disown,<br>And stick to one sound argument-your own,<br>Since you have proved to me, I don't deny,<br>That a pie-john's the same as a john-pie;<br>What follows, then, but, as a thing of course,<br>That a horse chestnut is a chestnut horse."<p>The POET is universally admitted to be the Cheapest<br>LETTERPRESS PRINTER in the City.
