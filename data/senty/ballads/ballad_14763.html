	<p> TOM AND JERRY.<p>A DIALOGUE BETWEEN A WHIG AND A TORY.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <p>As Jerry Whig went out one day&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Says Jerry, Tom, I'm glad we've met,<br>He met his friend Tom Tory;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To have some conversation;<br>Now Jerry was a Scotsman bred,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What must be done for Britain's sons,<br>And Tom was England's glory.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I want your observation.<p>Tom.?My friend, Jerry, you ask me what must be done for Britain's sons ? what<br>more can be done for them than what we have done ? in 1829 we granted them Eman-<br>cipation ; they then petitioned for Reform, we granted them that also ; now, my friend,<br>I  wish to know what more they want. Jerry ?I wonder you should speak obout<br>Emancipation, all the good it has done is, that it it has got some great men into high-<br>er situations in life thon those which they had been before. but it is an old sayiny,<br>Tom, 'a man that has a goose will get a goose 'but on the other hand, see what it<br>has done especially for the poor Irish 40s freeholders; it has driven numbers of them<br>out of their bit places, and sent them to wander to other nations in search of employ-<br>ment ; now, Tom, you see, a man that cannot pay £10, of rent, he is debarred from<br>his rights; so when he is exempted from having a vote for the representative for his<br>country, he ought to be exempted from Taxes : but as for Reform, we have got very<br>little more than the name.<p>So now, friend Tom, you plainly see&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our duty now we must fulfil<br>There's something more still wanting:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unto the British nation.<br>It's time to set the prisoners free,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Make them give up the Corn Bill,<br>For Freedom they are panting.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  And Tithes' abomination.<p><br>Tom.?My friend, Jerry, it would not answer for either you or I to middle with<br>the Corn Bill, as we have great landed properties, for self-interest goes far : how<br>would the farmers pay us our rents if we were to do away with the Corn Laws ? but<br>let the poor suffer as they will, we must mind No. 1.<p>The poor no longer we must scoff,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Against Church Patronage give your voice,<br>Belonging to this nation,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This time, I now do charge you,<br>Thisthing call'd Tithes must soon come off&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And let the people have their choice,<br>To lighten their Taxation.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of choosing their own Clergy.<p>Tom.?My friend, Jerry, I really am surprised to think that a man endued with<br>such knowledge as you are, would speak against the tithe system ; you know very<br>well that the tithe system is of an old standing : for when Abraham was returning<br>from the slaughter of the kings, he gave the tenth of the spoil to Melchizedek: the<br>tribe of Levi was allowed no inheritance in the land of Canaan, but the tithes. Jerry.<br>?We are bound to support Church and State, I think that is all very true, Tom, but<br>they had no glebe lands in those days, nor so many hundreds a-year off Government:<br>they could not drive through the nation in their coach-and four, and their livery ser-<br>vants, neither could they pay a man £40 or £50 a year, to officiate in their place, they<br>had to stick to the altar daily, and live by the altar Tom?But, Jerry, you speak<br>about taxes, you know that we are to render to Cæsar the things that are Cæsar's.<br>Jerry?Aye but, Tom, we have got too many Cæsars now-a-days to oppress the poor:<br>but, Tom, it was an easy thing in those days to pay tribute, when they had nothing.<br>to do but go to the sea, and catch a fish with a piece of money in its mouth?an easy<br>way indeed to pay tribute : but Tom, thero's no such fishes to be caught now-a-days<br>?if there were, the poor would get but little share of them.<p>In February, the 4th day,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;O'Connell and a number more,<br>We all must go to London,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Are joined in a communion,<br>To fall to work, without delay,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  To have justice done to Ireland,<br>I think we'll see some fun done.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or a repeal of the Union.<p><br>Tom.?My friend, Jerry, I know Mr O'Connell is a long-headed man, and a man<br>of great talents, he certainly must be a very wise man, for he has wrought himself and<br>his friends into Parliament by his policy, but there are very few men get into Parlia-<br>ment but what have self-interest at heart : now, my friend, Jerry, I will ask you a<br>questien, If you had signed your portion over to a friend before witnesses, how would<br>you get it back? It would be impossible unless your friend was willing to give it up<br>again?O'Connell may say what he pleases, but at this very time he will meet with<br>great opposition: how many Reformers, at the last election. who promised to do won-<br>ders for the people, but when they got into Parliament, they were like the chief but-<br>ler with Joseph, they soon forgot them they acted far worse than the Tories. Jerry.<br>?I confess you have spoken the candid truth, yet we must do something for the poor.<p>Now, Jerry, man, let us agree,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The poor right manfully have stood,<br>To you I will strike under,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To have their country righted,<br>We'll set the British captives free,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We're all come of one flesh and blood,<br>And pluck their chains asunder.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then why should they be slighted.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>Menzies, Printer, 30, Bank Street, Edinburgh.</p>
