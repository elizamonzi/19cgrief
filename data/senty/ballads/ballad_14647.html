	<p> Fearful Accident!<p>Four Lives Lost.<p>A Full and Particular Account of a most dreadful<br>circumstance which happened on Tuesday the 18th<br>February instant, in consequence of the escape,<br>from Wombwell's Menagerie, of the celebrated<br>Lion, Wallace, and a large Tigress, by which me-<br>lancholy accident, Four Human Beings were de-<br>stroyed !!!<p>A melancholy accident occurred at Wombwell's Menagerie, in con-<br>sequence of the lion, Wallace, and a large tigress escaping from the<br>caravan at Worksworth, on Tuesday night last, on the way to New-<br>haven fair. It appears that the drivers were putting the vans into<br>the yard of the White Lion Inn, when a carriage, laden with timber,<br>came in contact with the one in which the celebrated lion Wallace,<br>who contended with and defeated the dogs at Warwick, and a very<br>large tigress, were kept, and staved in the whole side of the vehicle.<br>Every pains possible were taken to prevent the beasts obtaining their<br>liberty, by repairing the van as well as circumstances would permit,<br>and by closing the gates of the yard ; but in the course of the night,<br>the beasts, being by nature restless, by some means removed one of<br>the broken pannels, and succeeded in making their escape by the<br>back yard into the fields, where the tigress attacked a number of<br>sheep, and killed three. The lion, finding himself at liberty, was by<br>no means idle, but falling in with some cows belonging to Mr Wil-<br>son, killed one, and severely wounded two others. The bleating of<br>sheep, the lowing of the cows, and the roaring of the lion, aroused<br>the keepers and several of the inhabitants, when instant pursuit was<br>made by the whole body in order to kill, or, if possible, to retake<br>them. They first discovered the lion about three or four fields dis-<br>tant, seeding on the cow which had fallen a victim to his unresisti-<br>ble fury. They immediately fronted him as well as their fears<br>would admit, and several shots were fired, though contrary to the<br>orders of the keeper, by which the lion was severely wounded.<br>The infuriated animal suddenly rushed upon a man who was at<br>some distance from him, and before assistance could be rendered,<br>he unfortunately killed him. He then dashed into a cow-shed,<br>where, by the well-known voice of the keepers, and their able ma-<br>nagement, he was secured, and lodged in a place of safety without<br>further mischief. The party then went in pursuit of the tigress,<br>which had taken another direction, and had fallen in with some<br>persons going to work at the brickfields.<p>The animal attacked a woman with a child in her arms, and a<br>boy of about 11 years of age, all of whom were killed before assis-<br>tance arrived. On the party coming up they were horror-struck at<br>the spectacle. Every exertion was made to secure the animal, but<br>it was not before she was so dangerously wounded as not to be ex-<br>pected to recover, that that object could be effected. On the fol-<br>lowing day an inquest was held, when, after a patient investigation,<br>a verdict of Accidental Death was returned, deodand £10 on the<br>beasts. Too much praise cannot be given to Mr Wombwell on the<br>promptness he displayed on hearing the melancholy accident. He<br>expressed the utmost concern, ordered the funerals of the sufferers<br>to take place at his expense, and promised to make good all damages<br>arising from the melancholy event.?Northampton Herald.<p>The following paragraph, which is of a different character from<br>the above, we copy from this day's Observer, as being rather a<br>ludicrous circumstance:?<p>STRANGE BED-FELLOW.?On the morning of Saturday week, an<br>old woman, residing in a house on the Castle Hill, was unspeaka-<br>bly surprised, on awakening from her night's rest, to find a strange<br>animal lying at her back,with one of its paws laid over her shoulder.<br>Screaming with affright, she left her bed, and seizing a towel, she<br>beat it with all her might, when, with one bound, it sprung to the<br>farthest corner of the room, and at length took refuge in another<br>bed which stood in the same apartment. When the poor woman<br>had a little recovered from her alarm, and had dissipated the idea<br>that it was a visitor from the nether regions, she remembered that<br>a collection of wild beasts were at present exhibiting on the<br>Mound, and began to suspect that her visitor belonged to the num-<br>ber. She immediately went and called upon Mr Wombwell, when<br>it was discovered that one of the kangaroos had made its escape<br>during the night, and going up to the Castle Hill, had found this<br>poor woman's door open, and, upon examination, finding that it might be as com-<br>pletely accommodated beside her as in its own den in the menageric, betook itself<br>to rest, which, however, was broken in upon in the morning in the manner we have<br>mentioned. The kangaroo was returned to Mr Wombwell, who handsomely re-<br>munerated the woman for its night's lodgings.  [MENZIES, Printer.<p><p></p>
