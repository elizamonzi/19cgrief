	<p> THE HADDINGTON  MURDERS!<p>The Life, History, and Transactions of Robert Emonds, with his Confession of the manner in<br>which he committed the Murders; also the Life and History of his wife, and Mrs Franks and<br>her daughter; together with the full particulars of Emond's Behaviour and Conversation in<br>the Jail up to this day,, Monday 15th February.<p>IN laying before our readers the<br>following particulars respect-<br>ing Emond, we assure them that<br>they contain the substance of e-<br>very thing- that has transpired re-<br>garding that individual and his<br>unfortunate victims. To a gentle-<br>man in the jail, the North Briton<br>Newspaper,and a native of Selkirk<br>we are endebted for our informa-<br>tion.<p>We shall therefore commence<br>with the history of Emond, as re-<br>lated to us by a school-fellow of<br>his own. Emond was born in Sel-<br>kirk, his father was a labourer,<br>and both his parents were account-<p>ed people of quiet and bonest dis-<p>positions. While at school Emond<br> showed various examples of his<br>cunning and ferocity, and would<p>punished for faults which his low<p>self to them. He was universally<br>hated and feared by his play fel-<br>lows, and so fiendish his disposi-<br>tion, that he was generally known<br>by the nick-name of the Fiend.<br>From the general hatred borne<br>to him in the village, through his<br>own hypocritical and disobliging<br>manner, he left it in the early part<br>of his life, and entered into his<br>majesty's service. After being<br>discharged, he returned to his<br>mother's, his father having died:<p>his demeanour was uncommon<p>good, attended divine worship re-<br>signs of inebriety. Having paid<br>attention to his education, and<br>could write a very good hand /ill/with<br> a knowledge of Arithmetic, and<br>at the same time very sensible in<p>his conversation on a varicty of<p>topics, he was advised to open a <br>school in the village, which, he did<p>for some time; but as this is an <p>employment not congenial to per- <p>sons of a ferocious and impatient<p>temperament, his cruelty soon<br>left his benches unocoupied. This<br>plan failing, he purchased a quan<br>tity of worsted, and other soft<br>goods, with which he travelled<p> During  his  peregrenations  as  a<p>packman, he met with his present<p>wife who was know for many <p>years all over the border by the<br>name of Highland Mary: she<br>was brought up on the Duke of<br>Gordon's estates, and came to<br>North Berwick as a Highland<br>shearer, and by industry and fru-<br>gality, by travelling with a pack,<p>she was  known often to have a<p>stock of Lace, silk mercery, and<p>other fashionable haberdashery<br>goods, worth from three to tour<br>hundred pounds. Her partiality<br>for Emonds astonished those who<p>were acquainted with them, and<p>his great sobriety and steadiness,<br>and being in possession of a pack<br>also Pretty valuable ; he was nev-<br>er seen to join in that social and<br>jocular bursts of good humour so<br>characteristic of scotch pedlars,<br>and which makes them receive so<br>hearty a welcome to the farmer's<br>blazing ingle. It is only three<br>yeare since Emond and his wife<br>took up house, first in Suderland<br>and then in North Berwick, and<br>it is said, with what truth we<br>know not, that their children were<br>born before their marriage was<br>publicly acknowledged. They<br>were far from being happy toge-<br>ther, as they had continud bick-<br>erings, and his usage of her was<br>very harsh.; in fact, her spiri was<br>so much broke down by him that<br>from  the neat, clean, and tildy<br>appearance she was always <br>markable for, she become sloven-<p>ly and quite careless of herself<br>she found her profits disappearing<p>without knowing where, although<br>she was in possession of a very<br>good business, until she saw E-<p>mond abstracting cash daily from<p>the drawer and hiding  it in a<br>coal cellar, where he had kept a<p>hoard for some time.<p>His  wife&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;her sister Mrs<br>Franks  had&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a  considerable sum<p>of money deposited in a bank in<p>thier joint names. this sum,above<p>two hundred pounds. Emond was<p>wishing to get hold of to enter in.<p>to a speculation which he said<p>would make his fortune. the<p>obstinate refusal of Mrs Franks,<br>and the repeated advice she gave<br>to her sister Dot to consent to it<br>was the reason he bore Mrs F.<br>such deadly enmity; and it was<p>for antipathy against the haber-<br>dasher in the south, who supplied<br>Emond with goods, and whose<br>advice was asked by the sisters,<br>Under the influence of this feeling<br>he meditated revenge on the par-<br>ties and on the sunday before he<br>committed the horrid deeds, he<br>had a serious quarrel with his wife<p>on the subject, and so savage was<p>his determination that he actually<br>forced her to the side of a deep<p>draw well and was in the act of<p>throwing her bodily into it, when<br>she was happily rescued by a<br>woman who had heard her stiffled<br>cries The following is his own<p>account of the manner in which he<p>accomplished the murders:<p>During&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;evening stricken<br>with  remorse for his usage of his<p>wife, he determind to be reveng-<p>ed on the person he believed to be<br>the cause of his domestic disquieti-<br>tude, and accordingly left his<p>ing she door inside, to make  his<br>family believe that he was in bed,<br>and set out for Abbey with a pre-<br>determined purpose to murder Mrs<br>Franks. When he reached the<br>cottage he knocked at the garden<br>door, at the same time announcing<p>himeself, and Mrs Franks knowing<p>his voice, after a short time ad-<br>mitted him. 'T hen Emond con-<br>trived to lead her into convers-<br>ation, and having thus thrown<br>her off her guard, he struck her a<br>violent blow with a bludgeon,<br>which however, had not the effect<br>of stunning or depriving her of her<br>senses; for, strong with terror<br>and the love of life, she ran out<br>of the house and fled towards<br>the garden-door, pursued by<p>Emond. He overtook her near<p>the pigstye, seized hold of her,<br>cut her throat with his penknife<p>and then threw her into the pig- <br>stye. He next bethought him<br>self that Magdalene Franks was<br>still alive and might bear wit.<br>ness against him ; so having dis-<br>patched her mother, be instantly<br>returned to the house, and beat in<br>the brains of the daughter with<br>some heavy instrument which he<br>calls a bludgeon, but which, from<br>the nature of the wounds indicted<br>must have had sharp angles. He<p>had no sooner done so. however,<p>then he was struck with remorse,<p>and in order to conceal from his<br>view the shattered head of his in-<p>nocent victim he covered it up<p>hastily with the  carpet. And hav-<br>ing thus murdered Magdalene<br>Franks, he took a table knife dab-<br>bed it in blood, stuck on it some,<br>gray bairs, torn from the bead of<br>Mrs Franks, in order to creat a<br> belief that the  murders had  been<br>perpetrated by this instrument,<br>and. then threw it carelessly from<br>him.<p>Emond is about 36 years of age,<br>of a thin make and middle sized;<br>the following is a correct portrait.<p>Mrs Franks enjoyed a pension<br>from the present Lord Elcbo's<br>grandfather, the earl of Wemyss,<br>whom her husband had long serv-<br>ed in the capacity of butler; to<br>this person his lordshiplately made<br>an addition. She was of a kind<br>and obliging disposition.<br>Magdalene was about fifteen years<br>of age, and remarkably pretty, at-<br>tentive to her lessons, and shewed<br>considerable aptness for the ac-<br>quisition of knowledge; she was<br>uncommonly dutiful to her mother<br>and to her acquaintances kind and<br>obliging; she was also very tiddy<br>and neat in her dress, and it was<br>affecting to observe her parasol,<br>frills, reticule, and sundry other<br>article, of wearing apparel lying<br>in the same state of careful order<br>in which she had left them, neatly<br>folded and covered, with handker-<br>chiefs, probably not many hours<br>before her young head was literally<br>shattered by the deadly blows of a<br>ferocious murderer- Indeed, from<p>all we have learned of her. Mag-<br>dulere Franks appears to have<br>can a single child of nature the<br>more interesting that he was just<p>ursting&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;into&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;womanhood:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She<p>was the favourite of every body ;<br>her beauty. her innocence, her<br>eleverness, her good humour and<br>narivele engaged the good will of<br>all whowere aceqneinted with her.<br>the old woman who streaked the<br>two bodies remarked that "Mag-<p>dalene Frank was the pride or<p>the village for her modest demean-<p>our. and friendly way in which she<br>reated all who had the pleasure of<br>ceing her. Mrs Franks has a<p>younger daughter surviving. and<p>lives with her aunt, Mrs Emonds,<p>who still retains the same premis-<p>es in North Berwick but she has<p>resumed her maiden name and got<br>Magdalene Munro" printed on<br>the sign-board above her shop door.<p>Emond appeared quite compos-<br>ed during his trial, and after he<br>left the Court he remained silent<br>ill he had entered the Lock-np-<br>house, when he begged the turn-<br>key lor a draught of water, which<br>was given him ; alter which he ask<br>ed for bread, which be also got<br>and ate greedily. He then demand<br>ed  his day's aliment, to purchase<br>pens, ink, and paper, and after<br>seme talk with Christie the turnkey<br>received sixpence in lieu of it He<br>exclaimed much against the evi-<p>dence of Tait saying he never<p>made such a declaration as that<p>fellow swore to, to any person on<p>earth, or until that moment when<p>he acknowledged his guilt and<br>snidhe felt, much relieved in con-<br>ed to my fate' He ascribed bis<p>the southside who he believed was<br>the cause of the mischief between<br>him and his wife; but he had<br>determined to publish the whole<br>history of the ease, as well as how<p>the munder were done, and the<p>great provocation he got Nothing<br>he said grieved him so much as the<br>thought of his poor mother, who<br>lives in Selkirk, and is now up-<p>wards of foursconre, as he was sure<p>his unhappy fate would bring her<p>to the grave. He had also a brother<p>he said for whom he was also a brother<p>While eating his brand be ob-<br>served, " You may perhaps think<p>I am a hardened man, but you are<p>mistaken, Iam not ; and although<br>there can be no pardon in my case<br>from man, there is pardon from<br>the Almighty, and to that I trust.<br>About 5 o'clock tuesday morning.<br>Emond was brought to the Calton<br>Jail from the Lock-up-hoUse in a<p>hackney coach : on alighting and<br>entering the ontler gate, and ap-<br>pearing to be in a very cheerful<br>and communicative mood, with A<br>great deal of levity in his manner<br>and bearing, be was accosted by<br>an individual present as follows  -<br>Emond, I think you onght to drop<br>that levity now'. He replied, Mr<p>-----I ,am happier now than I have<p>been since I was in  jail'&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr-----<p>then said,  I hope you are eased of<br>a burden by having made confes-<br>son, of the facts. To which he<br>answered, I never-denied them,<br>but  have to acknowledge the jus-<br>tice of God in all things.' Mr-----<p>then said, ' Emond are you guilty<br>of the murders or not ?' He repli-<br>ed in the affirmative;  I am the<p>man who committed the murder<p>for which I am justly condemned.<br>He several times repeated the<br>words. God is just in all I his ways,<br>with reference to his own case;<br>this took place on his way from the<br>gate to his cell, After the trial<p>was over a bed was made down<p>for him: on his entering the cell<p>and looking at the bed, he said,' I<br>suppose you have been prepared<br>for me during the day.' He was<br>answered 'Not so; the preparations<p>have only been made since the<p>trial was concluded.' He then<br>submitted very quietly to bo<br>ironed. During this appaling con-<br>versation his firmness and self-<br>possession continued unshaken,<br>and he slept soundly for several<br>hours thereafter.<p>Emond frankly confesses that<br>he intended to commit suicide if<br>his trial went against him, but on<br>reading one of Doddridge's works<br>given him by a humane individual,<p>convinced him that such an act <p>would only add one crime more to<p>the catalogue of his enormities.<br>His nights are passed in broken<br>slumbers, from which he generally<br>awakes in hurried starts, betraying<br>an awful state of mind which he<br>feels himself quite unable to de-<br>scribe. In the daytime he exhibits<p>the same restlessness and uneasi-<p>ness, and is haunted by the phan-<br>toms of his bleeding victim, until<br>his mind,overwhelmed by midnight<br>visions and day dreams of guilt<br>and punishment becomes excited<br>to a state bordering on frenzy,<br>under the influence of which he<br>talks wildly and incoherently; but<br>these paroxysms are seldom of very<p>long continuance, as he generally<p>finds relief in tears, and when he<p>his&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;mind  is somewhat  cased,  he<p>resumes his natural manner. He<p>done not seem much concerned<p>when the murder of Mrs Franks<br>is mentioned, but whenever the<br>name of Magdalene Franks is men.<br>tioned, or the idea shoots across<br>his mind, he is immediately seized<br>with the most dreadful fits of dis<br>pair, and exclaims, 'The innocent<br>blood calls for vengeance The<br>miserable wretch has not yet ex.<br>plained in what way he left the<br>premises When speaking of the<br>pen knife, he said ' Little did the<br>superintendent of police for Had-<br>ilington ken what the whittle did<br>which be carries in his pocket. To<br>those pious men who visit him he<br>converses freely- and seems anxious<br>to apply himself in the only way<br>that will entitle him to hope for<br>the pardon of his sins.<p>Glass, Printer 9,S Niddry street, Edinburgh.</p>
