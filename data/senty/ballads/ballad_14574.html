	<p> PENITENCE !<p><p>An excellent Form of a PRAYER, said to have been<br>aften used by the unfortunate JAMES Gow, Shoe-<br>maker, who was Executed yesterday, Friday the<br>2d of December 1831, for the Murder of his, Wife,<br>and whose Body was delivered to Dr. Munro for<br>dissection, since his condemnation.<p>James Gow, shoemaker, who was executed yester, with his fel-<br>low sufferer, Thomas Beveridge, blacksmith, both for the same<br>crime, namely, that of killing their wives, was very penitent, and<br>acknowledged the justness of his sentence, not only at his trial, but<br>on the scaffold, before the officiating magistrates. The following<br>prayer being often repeated, and his last words on this earth were,<br>" Lord have mercy on our souls ; Lord, receive our souls."<p>O LORD, Almighty God of our Fathers, Abraham, Isaac, and<br>Jacob, and of their righteous seed, who hast made heaven<br>and earth, with all the ornament thereof; who hast bound the sea<br>by the word of the commandment; who hast shut up the deep, and<br>sealed it by thy terrible and glorious name; whom all men fear<br>and tremble before thy power; for the majesty of thy glory cannot<br>be borne, and thine angry threatening towards sinners is importa-<br>ble ; but thy merciful promise is unmeasurable and nnsearch.<br>able; for thou art the most high Lord, of great compassion, long,<br>suffering, very merciful, and repented of the evils of men. Thou<br>O  Lord, according to thy great goodness, has promised repentance,<br>and for giveness  to them  that have sinned against thee; and of<br>thine infinite mercies hast appointed repentance unto sinners, that<br>they may be saved.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thou therefore, O Lord, that art the God of<br>the just, hast not appointed repentance to the just, as to Abraham,<br>and Isaac, and Jacob, which have not sinned against thee; but thou<br>hast appointed repentance  unto  me that am a sinner ; for I have<br>sinned above the number of the sands of the sea.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My transgres-<br>sions, O Lord, are multiplied; my transgressions  are multiplied,<br>and I am not worthy to behold and see the height of heaven for the<br>multitude of mine iniqueties.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I am bowed down with  many iron<br>bands, that I cannot life up mine head, neither have any release ; for<p>I  have provoked thy wrath, and done evil before thee; I did not thy<br>will, neither kept I thy commandments : I have set up abominations,<br>and have multiplied offences.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now therefore I bow the knee of<br>mine heart, beseeching thee of grace.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I have sinned, O Lord, I<br>have sinned, and I acknowledge mine iniquities : wherefore, I hum-<br>bly beseech thee, forgive me, O Lord, forgive me, and destroy me<br>not with mine iniquties.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Be not angry with me forever, by reserv-<br>ing evil for me; neither condemn me into the lower parts of the<br>earth.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For thou art the God, even the God of them that repent:<br>and in me thou wilt shew all thy goodness, for thou wilt save me<br>that am unworthy, according to thy great mercy.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Therefore I will<br>praise thee for ever all the days of my live: for all the powers of<br>the heavens do praise thee, and thine is the glory for ever and ever.<br>AMEN.<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; PRICE ONE PENNY.<p> </p>
