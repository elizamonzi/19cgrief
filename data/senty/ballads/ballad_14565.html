	<p> Melancholy Accident,<p>WITH<p>Farther Particulars<p>RELATIVE TO THE&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  <p>Gilmerton Murder, &c.<p><p>A true and farther particular Account of the whole tran-<br>sactions of these Monsters of Iniquity, the (supposed)<br>Violaters and Murderers of that unfortunate woman<br>Margaret Paterson.<p>The following melancholy and fatal accident is  copied from this<br>day's (Tuesday's Observer.)....<p>Distressing Accedent. ?Yesterday morning two slaters, employed<br>in repairing the roof of the Sugar-house, Canongate, were precipi-<br>tated to the ground, from the fastening of the ladder on which they<br>were standing giving way ; when one of them was killed on the<br>spot, and the other died in the course of the afternoon.<p>Thomson is aged from 20 to 22 years, and unmarried ; Dobie,<br>who is about 28 years of age, is married, and has two children.<p>Strange to relate this country, which used to boast itself so<br>much of the fancied moral superiorty of its people over those<br>of the sister kingdoms, has been disgraced by the commission of a<br>series of crimes so novel in their character, and arguing such a degree<br>of hardened depravity or calculating villany upon the part of the<br>perpetrators, as to astonish the whole world. We have had Burke<br>and Hare coolly pursuing deliberate murder as a trade, we have had<br>Stewart or Broadfoot, and his female associate, carrying on a system<br>of robbery by administering a fatal drug to those whom they had<br>marked out as their intended victims; and it is but the other day<br>that the remorseless Emond expiated on the gallows the innocent<br>blood which he had so inhumanly shed to gratify his causeless<br>revenge.<p>But we have how to state to the natives of Scotland, (this moral<br>country) that a crime has been committed which throws into the<br>shade Bulk, (Stewart) Broadfoot, and Emond, and which, we believe,<br>never happened in any spot in Modern Christendom. The unfor-<br>fortunate woman, Margaret Paterson, met Dobie and Thomson, at<br>Grayfield, and asked them for a ride, as she thought they belonged<br>to Dalkeith. They told her they were going round to Gilmerton,<br>and proposed conveying her to that place, provided she would give<br>them some whisky. The unfortunate woman agreed to this pro-<br>posal, and the parries in consequence adjourned to a public-house<br>near the toll-bar, where the carters called and paid for two gills, and<br>Margaret Paterson for an equal quantity, which was all drank.<br>They then set out for Gilmerton, by the Craigs road, which runs<br>between Sunnyside and the property immediately adjoining, from<br>the Dalkeith road on the east, till it reaches the Gilmerton or New-<br>battle road, on the west, a little to the northward of the village of<br>Greenend. The carters did not stop at Greenend, but pursued<br>their course towards Gilmerton; bent apparently, on the perpetra-<br>tion of the crime, which there is but too much reason to believe<br>they soon afterwards committed, within a short distance of that<br>place.<p>We cannot ascertain what time Dobie returned with or without<br>his cart. It is evident, however, that Dingwall, a quarrier, found<br>Thomson's cart at his door unattended, arid saw a woman's shawl<br>and other articles in it. Dingwall afterwards met Thomson, and<br>said to him, 'You have had a woman in the cart,' to which he re-<br>plied, " Oh, yes, she is coming behind.' We understand that on<br>the Tuesday after this foul and unnatural murder was committed,<br>Dobie made the treatment of Margaret Paterson a subject of mirth<br>in a smithy at Greenend. We know the very words the ruffian<br>made use of on this occasion, but as we cannot pollute the ears of<br>our citizens in describing it in English, we refrain from translating<br> it into any other language.<p>Edinburg - Printed for Felix O'Neil.</p>
