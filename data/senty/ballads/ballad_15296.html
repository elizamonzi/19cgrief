	<p> EXECUTION !<p>A Full and Particular ACCOUNT of SAMUEL<br>MAXWELL, who was Executed at the Head of<br>Libberton Wynd, Lawnmarket, Edinburgh, on Wed-<br>nesday Morning, the 17th January, 1821, for<br>Stouthrief and Robbery, committed in the House of<br>Mr Arneil, near Glasgow, last year.<p>SAMUEL MAXWELL, or, as some called him, M'CORMICK,<br>which is said to have been his real name, was tried, with three<br>other, viz. ROBERT MUIR, JAMES DONELLY, and ALEX-<br>ANDER HAMILTON, before the High Court of Justiciary, on<br>the 12th of December last, for breaking into the house of Mr Ar-<br>neil, residing in the vicinity of Glasgow, and carrying off a great<br>deal of property. The libel was found not proven against Robert<br>Muir and James Donnelly ; who, after an admonition from the Lord<br>Justice Clerk, were dismissed from the bar. Hamilton, in conse-<br>quence of the unanimous recommendation of the Jury, though<br>condemned with Maxwell, has since been respited during his Ma-<br>jesty's pleasure; so that, of the four tried for the same crime, Max-<br>well alone has suffered the extreme punishment of the law.<p>Maxwell was a good looking young man, apparently about 24<br>year of age, of an intelligent and prepossessing appearance; and,<br>previous to the awful sentence of the law being passed upon him,<br>he stood up, and, in a respectful, though animating manner, ad-<br>dressed  the Court in the following terms, to the surprise and asto-<br>nishment of many present:?" I now, standing before you, my<br>Judges, as I, in all probability, must appear before my heavenly<br>Judge, unwilling that the innocent should suffer with the guilty,<br>and in order to caution your Lordships against the like in future,<br>beg to request yonr Lordships' attention to what I have now to say,<br>?I am guilty.?I confess the crime ; but there is not one word of<br>truth in the evidence by which I am convicted. All the witnesses,<br>except the Arneils and William Lochhead, have perjured themselves;<br>and, for any thing that is known to the Court to the contrary, I am<br>innocent. The robbery was committed by me and four others;<br>neither of the prisoners besides myself was concerned in it, and<br>neither of us were in the M'Wiiliams's, and Dolin knew nothing<br>about the matter."?He added, that ' he hoped Hamilton would<br>not suffer, as he was perfectly innocent."<p>After the delivery of this confession, the Lord Justice Clerk, af-<br>ter exhorting them, in the most solemn and impressive manner, to<br>devote the short period of life allowed them by the law, to spiritual<br>instruction, and promising them the assistance of the ministers of<br>any persuasion they preferred, passed the awful sentence of the<br>Court, which was, that they should be Executed at the ordinary<br>place of Execution, on Wednesday  the 17th of January, 1821, be-<br>tween the hours of eight and ten in the morning.<p>This uufortunate young man appeared .perfectly resigned to his<br>fate, and has behaved himself with great propriety since his con-<br>demnation.?The Clergymen of the City have been very attentive<br>to him, and he was also visited by several private individuals, to<br>whom, we were informed, he appeared very penitent, and very grate-<br>ful for the kindness and attention shewn him. Accordingly, this<br>morning, Wednesday, l'7th January, 1821, in pursuance of his sen-<br>tence, he was conducted from. the Lock-up-house, by the Clergy-<br>men, the officiating Magistrates, preceded by their Officers, and se-<br>veral other individuals, escorted by a large detachment of Police<br>Officers, up to the head of Libberton Wynd, Lawnmarket, where<br>the gibbet was erected, a little past eight o'clock. Immediately on<br>appearing on the Scaffold, one of the Clergymen prayed very fer-<br>vently for twelve or fifteen minutes, when Maxwell turned round,<br>shook hands with some about him, and bowed to the Magistrates<br>and others. He was then assisted to mount the fatal drop, when<br>he prayed most earnestly for several minutes, while the executioner<br>was fixing and adjusting the rope, who then spoke to him, and in<br>two or three minutes, he dropt the signal, and was instantly<br>launched into eternity, a little before nine o'clock. amidst a great<br>crowd of spectators.<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Edinburgh?Printed for R. Watson.?PRICE ONE PENNY.</p>
