	<p> EXECUTION.<p>A Full and Particular Account of the Execution of<br>WILLIAM THOMSON, Labourer, who was Executed<br>this day, Thursday, 1st March 1827, at Dalkeith,<br>for Highway Robbery; together with his Beha-<br>vour since his condemnation, and at the place of<br>Execution, as also his Last Words on the Scaffold.<p>THIS unfortunate young man was condemned before the High<br>Court of Justiciary, on Monday the 22d January last, along<br>with his brother, James Thomson, and John Fram, (but who were<br>recommended to mercy by the Jury, and have since been respited<br>during his Majesty's pleasure,) for attacking and assaulting George<br>Dickson, farmer in Cousland, on the evening of the 30th November<br> last, near the foot of Langside IBrae, in the parish of Dalkeith, to<br>the great effusion of his blood, and robbing him of a silver hunting<br>watch, and other articles. They were unanimously found Guilty,<br>and heard the awful sentence of death pronounced unmoved Wil-<br>liam Thomson pertly ejaculating to the Lord Justice Clerk, " Thank<br>you, my Lord."<p>These men were very hardened at the time of their trial, but as<br>William Thomson never entertained any hopes of pardon, conse-<br>quently he was soon induced to make up his mind to his awful<br>situation. Mr Porteous, the chaplain of the Jail, has been most assi-<br>duous in his attentions to this unhappy man, as well as several<br>other ministers of this city. He felt bitterly, for a short time, when<br>his brother and Fram got the respite, but soon recovered his usual<br>composure. He latterly became very penitent, and rergretted exceed-<br>ingly the life he formerly led. He was often heard to cry, " Oh !<br>if I had my life to begin again, it would not be spent as formerly/'<br>On Wednesday he took a last farewell of his wife, and several other<br>friends, which was a most heart-rending scene, we have heard, to<br>those who witnessed it. He likewise took leave of James Thomson,<br>his brother, and of John Fram, in an aff/?/ctionate manner.<p>Accordingly, this day, Thursday the 1st March 1827, in pur-<br>suance of his Sentence, William Thomson was put into a hackney<br>coach at the Calton Jail, attended by the Sheriff and his Officers, in<br>several other carriages, and drove off for Dalkeith, after 12 o'clock.<br>After resting there for a few hours, during which a psalm was sung,<br>and a fervent prayer offered up to the throne of grace on his behalf,<br>his arms were pinioned, and was led out to the scaffold, which was<br>erected on the main street of Dalkeith, where another psalm was<br>sung, and another prayer put up for him. He then turned to the<br>multitude, and spoke a few words in an audible distinct manner,<br>bewailing his own awful fate, and beseeching them to take warning<br>from his disgraceful and shameful end. All this while the Execu-<br>tioner was adjusting the apparatus of death. The pannel then shook<br>hands with his friends, and with all the official gentlemen around<br>him, returning them his sincere thanke for their attention, and for<br>their kind indulgence since his confinement. He then mounted<br>the fatal drop, and while the Executioner was untying his handker-<br>chief, fixing the rope, and drawing the cap over his head, he was<br>observed to be engaged in most fervent prayer. All things being<br>adjusted, and the unfortunate man left on the fatal drop, with in-<br>structions how to act, in a very few minutes he dropped the signal,<br>and was launched into eternity, admidst a vast multitude of specta-<br>tors, there being no execution in Dalkeith, within the memory of<br>any living man.<p>After hanging for half an hour, the body was cut down, and de-<br>livered to his friends for interment, a few minutes before 4 o'clock.<p>Printed for WILLIAM HENRY.<p><br></p>
