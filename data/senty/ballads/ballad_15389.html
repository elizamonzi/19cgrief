	<p> Dreadful Riot in London.<p>A Full, True, and Particular Account of that Great Public Meet-<br>ing which took place in Coldbath-fields, London, on Monday last,<br>for the purpose of forming a NATIONAL CONVENTION,<br>giving an account of the Speeches delivered on the occasion,--<br>Together with an account of the desperate attack made on the<br>meeting by a body of 3000 Policemen, under the direction of<br>Lord Melbourne, and Colonel Rowan and Mr Mayne, -with the<br>names of the killed and wounded, and the number taken prisoners.<p>From the Caledonian Mercury,  May 16th,  1833.<p>During the last week bills have been issued, stating that a meet-<br>ing would be held in Coldbathfield this day, in order to adopt the<br>preliminary measures necessary for the calling together of a NA-<br>TIONAL CONVENTION.  In consequence of that bill, on Fri-<br>day a proclamation was issued by the Secretary of State for the<br>Home Department, declaring that such a meeting would be illegal<br>and dangerous to the public peace, and warning all persons to keep<br>away, as the authorities had received orders to maintain the peace<br>at all hazards.<p>Accordingly, this morning the Police began to asrive [arrive] in Gray's<br>Inn Lane before twelve o'clock, in great numbers ; and were dis-<br>posed of in stable-yards in the in neighbourhood of the intended place<br>of meeting.<p>Before one o'clock, Lord Melbourne and the two Commissioners<br>of Police, Colonel Rowan and Mr Mayne, with about a dozen Ma-<br>gistrates, had assembled at the White Hart, Gray's Inn Lane.<p>By about one O'clock, there were from 600 to 700 persons as-<br>sembled in the fields, which number had increased to upwards of<br>1000 at two o'clock, the hour named for the Chairman to open the<br>meeting In the meantime thote assembled were amused by two<br>prosessed infidels, who promulgated their doctrines.<p>We understood the Committee were sitting in the Union public-<br>house, but they did no t make their appearance till three o'clock,<br>when a young man (Mr Lee or Leigh) and three or four others,<br>mounted a van that was pladed in front of the palings at the top of<br>Calthorpe Street; but as the carman was afraid of his van, and<br>could not be persuaded to stop, they were under the necessity of<br>dismounting from their elevation when Mr Lee, got upon the pal-<br>ing, and proposed that Mr Mee should act as Chairman, which<br>proposition was seconded and carried.<p>Mr Mee then also got upon the paling, and, after thanking the<br>meeting for the honour they had conferred on him, said he was glad<br>to see before him so many noble men. It was not the coronet or a<br>flashing equipage that made a noble man, though in the eyes of the<br>world they made noble ; but he gave that name to those he saw a-<br>round him, because they were the producing power?the real wealth<br>of the country-(Cheers.) He was thankful to the Whig Ministry,<br>who had given an importance to the meeting which it otherwise would<br>have wanted?(cheers and hisses)?but the question now for them to<br>consider was. whether, as they had met under sucn disadvantages,<br>they should go on-(Go on, go on)?or whether they should adjourn<br>till a more convenient opportunity-(No, no, go on, go on) He was<br>but working man with a family, therefore if they were not prepared<br>to give to his family one-tenth of their earning they should not cry<br>" Go on."---------The speaker was here interrupted by the cry of<br>" Police !" who bad arrived at the end of Calthorpe Street, and form-<br>ed right across it, whet, they advanced in double-quick-time upon<br>the meeting. Another party came up by a side street, and also<br>attacked those assembled.<p>The Chairman made some few further remarks, and called out<br>to the meeting to " stand firm ;" but with these words in his mouth,<br>be jumped down from his position, and escaped by the back of the<br>Hlouse of Correction. The police came on, and used their staffs<br>pretty freely, their object evidently being to catch the Chairman,<br>and those connected with him in the meeting.<p>The meeting was dispersed in two or three minutes, running in<br>all directions. Many heads were broken, and we are sorry, for the<br>character of Englishmen, to say, that one policeman, named Ro-<br>bert Cully, letter C. 95, was stabbed through the heart, and died<br>in less than ten minutes after. Other two men of the same division<br>were stabbed-one through the arm, and the other in the side, but<br>they are expected to do well.<p>The police then formed in the neighbouring, streets, and sent out<br>parties in pursuit of those who were implicated in the day's pro-<br>ceedings. Before five o'clock they had got upwards of thirty pris-<br>oners, among whom were Mr Lee, and several of the Committee<br>?they also succeeded in capturing all the flags of the Unions that<br>were present, with various devices, some surmounted with the red<br>cap of liberty. We left at six o'clock, when all was quiet ; part of<br>the police had then retired, and the search was still continued af-<br>ter Mr Mee.<p>Edinburgh, Printed for Francis M'Cartney.</p>
