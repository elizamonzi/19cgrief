	<p> THE LAST<p>SPEECH and CONFESSION<p>OF<p>Margaret Crooks, who was Executed<br>at the Grass-Market of Edinburgh,<br>the twenty fourth of December 1718.<br>for the Murthering her own Child.<p>MARGARET CROOKS, Born in the Parish of North-Berwick in East<br>Loutbian, Aged Twenty Five Years, or thereby ; Being but of Poor<br>Parents, whose Father Deceased when she was but a Child, and the<br>sober Circumstances of her Mother was the Occasion of her being not Educat-<br>ed nor learned to Read ; But Engaged her self in Country Service such as<br>she was Capable off, where she fell Acquainted with a Young Man, whom<br>she says Courted her under Pretence of Marriage, and appointed the<br>Martimas following for the Accomplishing the same ; But during which<br>Time she fell with Child,she says that she told( the Father of it ) and he<br>at that Time Discouraged her with offering to go off the Country. Which<br>was the .Cause of her Concealing her being with Child. And Three<br>Months before her Delivery left her Service, and went home to her Mo-<br>thers House, who is an Aged old Woman, Living in the Parish of Ditle-<br>toun in East-Louthian. At which Place she was Delivered of a Child<br>without help, her Mother being not at Home at that Time.<p> And she likewise  Declares and Affirms that the Child was Dead Born;<br>And she striving still to Conceal the same; And in a Day or two there-.<br>after carried the Dead Child to 'tis Father, who she Declares earnestly<br>Requested her to Burrie the same. Which she owns she did Burrie in<br>an Old Feel Dick, three Miles from her Mothers House. And then re-<br>turning to her Mothers House, found it in Confusion by an Accidental<br>Fire which had happened the House during her Absence.<p>And thereafter being Challenged by the Minister of the Parish, she<br>did Confess that she had brought, forth a Child but that it was Dead<br>Born, and that she had Burried the same. Where upon the Minister who<br>had been at great Pains with her, ordered some of his Parishoners to go_<br>with her to the place where she had Burried it. And when they had<br>found it the Child was not in the least Putrified, and the same Time she<br>took the Pains of a Woman in Labour, notwithstanding it was Eleven<br>Days before that Time, that she was Delivered of her Child.<p>She also Regreated her taking the Sacrament, during the time of her<br>being with Child. <p>She was very Penitent upon the Scaffold, and own'd the justice of<br>her Sentance; The Ministers taking very much Pains upon her, Praying<br>with her and for her, she desired the Prayers of all good Christians for her<br>and desired the Spectators to take Example by her. <p>EDINBURGH, Printed at the Foot of the Horse Wynd.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1718.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <p></p>
