	<p> THE LAST<p>S P E E C H<p>DYING WORDS<p>Of Janet Hutchie, who was Execute in the Grass-market<br>of Edinburgh, upon the 30th of August 1721, for the<br>Murder of her own Child.<p>JUSTLY now may I to my sad Experience append my Seal with  the  Holy Man, job<br>14.  1. Man that is Born of a Woman, is of few Days, and full of Troubles, Psalm 51.5.<br>I was conceived in Sin, and brought forth in Iniquity, and from&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;that&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mass&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of Original<br>Guilt has arrived to such anHeignt and Pitch of actualTransgressions, that I am hard-<br>ly to be reckoned among the Society of Christians, but am sentenced and adjudged justly to<br>be cut off  from the Body thereof, as an Infectious Member,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;least  it  should  endanger the<br>whole Body, and justly with the Holy Psalmist to my Bitter Experience, ory out, Iniquities,<br>Iniquities have prevailed, but O purge away my Sin, Psalm 65. 3. And as a Bullock unaccustom-<br>ed to the Yoke, ran on in a Course of Sin, not thinking that GOD would lay them before<br>my Face, for Reprove me therefore ; till at last that Holy Judge of Heaven and Earth, be-<br>fore whom all Things are naked and bare, has in his Holy Providence found me out at last<br>in this my Brutal Wickedness, and am now in a little to lay down my Life for the Unnatu-<br>ral Crime of taking away the Life of the Innocent Fruit of my own Body, and&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;now stands<br>a Monument to Men and Angels upon a Gibbet, ready Erect for that Effect, to receive the<br>Fatal Blow as a Visible Judgment of the Divine Displeasure and Indignation of the Almighty<br>GOD, against such a Monstruous and Horrid Crime as I have  been Guilty of.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh that<br>now I may be made a singular Monument of the unsearchable Riches and Free Mercy, and<br>Grace of GOD, through JESUS CHRIST his only Son my LORD; not having my own<br>Righteousness, which is nothing, but that of his imputed to me, which yet  can make me<br>clean before that great Tribunal, for as black as the Devil, Hell and my own Corruptions<br>have made me.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <p>It would be expected I should give some Account of my self, and satisfie the World, as to<br>several Aspersions that passed upon me , and as I am a dying Woman, I shall declare to the<br>World the naked Tru h, and it only, so far as my Memory can serve me, and do Justice to<br>Peter Vdlldnce whom I horridly wronged by leasing making on him.<p>I was Born in the Weems, my Parents coming over to Preston grange while I was a Child,<br>where they lived till they died, which was several Years agoe, and were not wanting to me<br>in my Education, conform to ( rather beyond) their Station and Abilities.<p>I am now going in 30 Years of Age, and declares; I never knew a Man in the World<br>but John Williamson to whom the Child was, alace a married Man, his Wife being my own<br>Commerad while she was unmarried. I intirely free him of the Act of Murder it self,as was al-<br>ledged; But acknowledges, it was by his Advice and Direction,and he desired me earnestly to<br>do it; and when it was done to put it in some Hole or another, that it might be hid from<br>the Eyes of the World. But Oh! who can hide from the Eye of an All-seeing GOD, to<br> whom all Things are naked and bare.<p>I likewise further own, I never knew the said Williamson but once in an Morning, when<br>my Brother and Family were at the Coal-pit, but he has frequently attempted it, but never<br>got his Design perpetuate but that Time, by which I was got with Child by him, and when<br>I found my self with Child, I told him, and he gave me several Things to Cause me Mis-<br>carry, but I never took them. I did not Reveal my being with Child to any but to him<br>and one Isobel Guthry, who in a little after died in Child-bed.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<p>I truly own my Guilt in destoying the Child, but not directly, for it was alive when I<br>was delivered, but for want of Help and my Unnaturality in the Birth it soon died, which<br>if it had not, I was resolved to have strangled it, which makes me equally Guilty in the<br>Sight of GOD, as if I had actually done it, and thereafter tyed it in a Codwair, and keep-<br>ed it three Days in my Chest, into which Codwair I put an big Stone, and threw it in a<br>Mill-dam, where it lay 18 Days before it was found, and knows nothing of its having a<br>Cord about its Neck, as the Witnesses declared, unlels it had been the Knitting of the said<br>Codwair, and what Stories Janet  Ritchie and  Isobel Vint said of my having a Child before is<p>intirely</p>
