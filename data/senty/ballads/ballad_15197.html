	<p> Extraordinary Occurrence,<br>and Supposed Murder, &c.<p><p>An Account of a most Extraordinary cir-<br>cumstance that took place on Friday<br>night, the 31st October 1828, in a<br>House in the West Port, Edinburgh,<br>where an old Woman of the name of<br>Campbell is supposed to have been<br>Murdered, and her Body Sold to a<br>Medical Doctor.<p>WE have various accounts of the above me-<br>lancholy occurrence, which, of course, we<br>cannot vouch for. There is no doubt, however, of<br>the circumstance, of the body of an old woman<br>being seen on the floor of the house of Burt or<br>Burke, in the West Port, and of the same body<br>being taken from a Lecture Room to the Police<br>Office yesterday morning, under very suspicious<br>' circumstances of having been murdered. We copy<br>the following paragraph from this day's Evening<br>Courant on the subject, which is the only account<br>yet published of this affair :?<p>" An old woman of the name of Campbell, from<br>Ireland, came  to Edinburgh  some  days  ago, in<br>search of a son, whom she found, and who after-<br>wards went out of town, in  search of work.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She<br>took  up her lodgings  on Friday, in  the house of<br>a man named Burt or Burke, in the West Port.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It<br>appears that there was  a merry making in Burke's<br>that night; at least the noise of music and dancing<br>was heard,  and it is believed the glass circulated<br>pretty freely among the party.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Old woman, it<br>is said, with  reluctance joined in the mirth, and<br>also partook of the  liquor, and was  to  sleep on<br>straw alongside of Burke's bed.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; During the night<br>shrieks  were heard ; but the neighbours paid no<br>attention, as such sounds were not unusual in the<br>house.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the morning, however, a female,  on<br>going into Burke's, observed the old woman lying<br>as if dead, some of the straw being above her.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She<br>did not say any thing, or raise any alarm ; but, in<br>the evening, circumstances transpired which led to<br>a belief that all was not right, for, by this time the<br>body had been removed out of the house, and, it<br>was suspected, had been sold to a public lecturer.<br>Information was conveyed to the police, and the<br>whole party taken into custody.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After a search,<br>the body was found yesterday morning in the lec-<br>ture room of a respectable practitioner, who, the<br>instant he was informed of the circumstance, not<br>only gave it up, but afforded every information in<br>his power.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The body is now in the police-office,<br>and will be examined by medical gentlemen in the<br>course of the day.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There are some very strong<br>and  singular circumstances  connected  with  the<br>case, which have given rise to the suspicions."<p>Edinburgh, 3d November, 1828,<br>PRICE ONE PENNY.</p>
