	<h2>Transcription</h2>
	<p> Execution!<p>Dennis Doolan and Patrick Redding were ex-<br>ecuted yesterday morning at Crosshill, about three<br>miles north of Glasgow, in pursuance of the sen-<br>tence of the Justiciary Circuit Court held there<br>upon the 22d ultimo, for the murder of John<br>Green, ganger upon the Edinburgh and Glasgow<br>Railway. The murder, which they have expiated<br>with their lives, was committed on the 10th of De-<br>cember, 1840.<p>Every precaution was taken by the authorities to<br>awe down any attempt which might be made to<br>break the peace, either on the line of road, or at the<br>place of execution, and accordingly, in addition to<br>the infantry guard, which escorted the gallows, and<br>remained over night, two pieces of artillery were also<br>sent out, and planted in commanding situations near<br>the spot.<p>At eight o'clock on Friday morning, the proces-<br>sion moved from Glasgow prison in the following<br>order :?<p>Cavalry,Infantry,and Police<p><p>Cavalry.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>City Marshal&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>Culprits.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>Cavalry.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>The Executioner.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  <br>Sheriff.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>Lord Provost.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  <br>Magistrates.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>Cavalry.<p>Cavalry,Infantry and Police&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  <p>The culprits were placed, loosely pinioned, in a<br>large open carriage, accompanied by their religious<br>instructors, Bishop Murdoch and one of his clergy.<br>Thoir seats were considerably elevated, so that they<br>could be seen by almost every one of the dense mul-<br>titude who accompanied them to the place of execu-<br>tion. In this manner the procession moved up the<br>Saltmarket, the High Street, and out the Kirkintil<br>loch road, to Bishopbridge, where, as we have stated,<br>a gusrd of infantry, with Mr Sheriff Bell, were al-<br>ready present. The number of the military escort<br>was estimated at about 600 or 700 infantry, and<br>about 200 cavalry. Two troops, we underitand, of<br>the 4th dragoon guards, from Piershill barracks<br>were ordered west for the occasion.<p>Arrived at the spot, the culprits descended from<br>the vehicle, and again accompanied by their con-<br>fessors, ascended the platform with a firm step. Af-<br>ter some time spent in religious devotion, the exe-<br>cutioner proceeded to do his duty. In adjusting<br>the rope, it was observed that this officer gave Red-<br>ding, who was a slender and small man, about 18<br>inches more of a drop than he did to Doolan, who<br>was a stout and heavy person.<p>After the clergyman had left the culprits, and all<br>Was ready, Doolan turned round to his companion<br>in crime to bid him farewell, and in doing so it was<br>observed that the knot on the noose of the rope<br>slipped from under his left ear to the back of his<br>neck, and the consequence was, that he struggled<br>severely for several seconds after the drop fell;<br>Redding seemed to die instantly.<p>After hanging the usual time, the bodies were<br>cut down, and being put in cossins, were placed on<br>the vehicle which had a short time previously car-<br>ried them out in life, and escorted in the same man-<br>ner back to Glasgow, where they were interred in<br>the evening within the precincts of the prison.<p>None of the Railway labourers were at their<br>work but few of them were to be seen, either at<br>the execution or on the line of procession, and we<br>are informed that many of them had resolved to<br>stop away, to show their contempt of the insult<br>which they conceived had been offered to them in<br>bringing the execution to Crosshill.<p>Menzies, Printer.</p>
