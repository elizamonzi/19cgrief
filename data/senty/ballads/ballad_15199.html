	<p> Execution.<p>A Full and Particular Account of the<br>Execution of JOHN HILL and WILLIAM<br>PORTER, who were executed at Glas-<br>gow, yesterday, Wednesday the 12th<br>May 1830, for Assaulting and Rob-<br>ing William Marshall, an old man of<br>76 years of age, on the 19th Decem-<br>last; with their Behaviour since con-<br>demnation and at the place of Exe-<br>cution.<p>W E D N E S D A Y morning, May 12, 1830,<br>JOHN MILL and WILLIAM PORTER,<br>who were convicted at last Glasgow Assizes of as-<br>saulting and robbing William Marshall, a man 76<br>years of age, in an avenue to the north of the city,<br>known by the name of 'Stewart's Road,' on the<br>evening of Saturday the 10th of December last,<br>paid the forfeit of their lives, at the usual place of<br>execution. Ever since their condemnation, the<br>prisoners conducted themselves with the greatest<br>propriety, and in a manner which gave those cha-<br>ritable and pious persons who visited them the<br>highest satisfaction.<p>In consequence of their youth?neither of them<br>being above nineteen years of age-a number of<br>humane individuals made considerable exertions<br>in order to obtain a commutation of the sentence ;<br>but the agents to the parties received for answer<br>that the prayer of the petition could not be com-<br>plied with, the crime being one of great aggrava-<br>tion.<p>On Tuesday evening, the parents and friends of<br>the two unhappy youths were admitted to take<br>their last farewell; and the scene that took place<br>between Porter, his mother and sisters, is describ-<br>ed to have been affecting in the highest degree.....<p>Both prisoners slept soundly for two hours on<br>Tuesday night. They were waited on at 7 o'clock<br>on Wednesday morning by the magistrates and<br>clergyman, who spent some time in prayer, and<br>shortly after the executioner appeared, who pi-<br>nioned both their arms.<p>After the usual religious ceremonies had been<br>gone through, they left the Hall, and with a com-<br>paratively light step mounted the Scaffold, where<br>Dr Smyth offered up an energetic prayer ; after<br>which Porter warmly embraced his companion,<br>and during the time the executioner was engaged<br>in adjusting the ropes, he prayed loudly. Hill<br>was heard speaking, but in a low tone.<p>Every thing being ready, Porter was furnished<br>with the handkerchief, when, in an instant, he<br>gave the fatal signal, and the drop fell. They<br>both struggled violently for three minutes, when<br>life was extinct. After hanging the usual time,<br>the bodies were cut down, and delivered over to<br>their relations. The crowd was considered larger<br>than on many previous occasions of a similar de-<br>scription; but happily every thing went off<br>quietly.<p>Edinburgh.....Printed for Felix O'Neill</p>
