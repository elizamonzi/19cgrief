	<p> Resignation<p>OF<p>M I N I S T E R Y.<p>A Full, True, and particular Account of the Surprising and Much<br>Reted News just received by this Evening's London Mail,<br>of the Resignation of EARL GREY and the Present Ministery,<br>in conseqxence of their losing their motions for the Reduction of<br>the Malt and Window Tax Duties,-?With the resolution of the<br>House of Commons and the Inhabitants of London to Petition<br>his Majesty for their continuance in Office.<p>From the Caledonian Mercury, April 29th,  1833.<p>Ministers having on Friday been most unexpectedly left in a<br>minority on the subject of the Malt Tax, is confidently reported<br>that they intend to resign.<p>A corespondent, whose letter is dated Saturday, half-past five o'-<br>clock, writes, that " EARL GREY" is with the KING at THIS<br>MOMENT." There will be great difficulty, however, in accepting<br>their RESIGNATION, and the prevailing opinion seems to be,<br>that the HOUSE of COMMONS will vote an address to his MA-<br>JESTY praying him to RETAIN EARL GREY and his COL-<br>LEAGUES in Office. The division on the MALT TAX was to<br>say the least of it, most inconsiderate and rash ; indeed it was<br>uuite a surprise to every one ; and many who voted against the<br>MINISTERS are now, we understand, sosely vexel at their<br>folly. The result of the division was so completely unexpected<br>that our correspondent, like many others, had left the House, ne-<br>Ver dreaming of such a denouement, more especially as Govern-<br>ment had given no notice of attendance.The City, however, it is<br>believed, will take up the matter immediately, and petition the<br>King not to accept of the resignation of Lord Grey and his Col-<br>leagues ; in short, Ministers may threaten to go out, but they will<br>not be allowed?for who can possibly COME IN at present in their<br>stead?and all will soon go on smoothly. Some decided demon -<br>stration on their part has, however, become absolutely necessary.<br>For the reduction of half the MALT duty, amounting to upwards <br>of<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;TWO MILLIONS.<p>and the standing notice of motion for a TOTAL REDUCTION of<br>the HOUSE and WINDOW TAX, which is also likely in the<br>prosent temper of the House to be carried, would render it im-<br>possible for any Ministry to carry on the Government of the<br>Country.</p>
