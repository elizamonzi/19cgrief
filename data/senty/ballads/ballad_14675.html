	<p> Execution.<p>An account of the Execution of two Servant Girls, Bridget Butterly<br>and Bridget Ennis, who suffered at Kilmainham Jail, on Friday the<br>4th May, 1821, and their bodies given to Surgeon's Hall, for dis-<br>section, for the murder of Miss Thompson, a young lady, in whose<br>house they once lived; to which is added, the whole confession they<br>made of the Murder on the morning of their Execution;<p>On Friday last, Bridget Butterly and Brid-<br>get Ennis we're executed at Kilmainham for<br>the murder of a young lady of the name of<br>Miss Thomson. An immense number of peo-<br>ple assembled on the occasion, who murmured<br>loudly against the inhuman victims had<br>committed this horrid Bloody deed: When<br>the awful preparations were completed, the<br>drop fell, and Butterly died instantaneously ?<br>Ennis appeared to suffer much, her body heav -<br>ed violently after her limbs had ceased to move.<br>After hanging the usual time the bodies were<br>taken down and sent to Surgeon's Hall to be<br>dissected. A corps of Horse Police, on guard,<br>amongst whom a poor inoffensive dog unfor-<br>tunately took refuge, at this awful hour, ex<br>cited their sport, and whom they cut in pieces,<br>with their swords, each making a smash at it, as<br>it ran moaning from the wounds it had receiv-<br>ed ; pleasant diversion indeed for the hands<br>of the preservers of peace to be engaged in !<br>Another scene occurred, owing to the Sheriff<br>ordering the Police to drive the people back.<br>The orders were promptly obeyed, and the<br>cries of old and young were heard in every<br>direction; fortunately no lives were lost.<p>About 8 o'clock of the morning of the exe-<br>cution, the prisoners made a public confession.<br>Butterly related that, when waiting in Chapel<br>Street for a young man to whom she was hired<br>as a servant, Captain Peck came and asked<br>her to take a glass of wine with him. She<br>went to a house to evade him, and when go-<br>ing into the Street next morning, she was, to<br>her great surprise, accosted by the Captain,<br>who had been watching her. By means of<br>money, and promises of protection, she was<br>prevailed upon to go and live in Capt. Peck's<br>house, where she had a miscarriage while she<br>slept in his bed. She left the house in conse-<br>quence of Captain Peck being informed of her<br>speaking disrespectfully of Miss Thompson<br>and another person. Ennis suggested that they<br>should go to England, and the robbery of the<br>house of Capt. Peck would procure the means.<p>She then detailed the following circumstances<br>of the murder and robbery : ?' Biddy,' said I,<br>laughing, ' what will become of us if we do<br>any thing with the young lady?' Ennis re-<br>plied, ' I would sooner kill a dozen than be<br>taken.'?I then exclaimed, ' Oh, what will<br>become of my poor father and mother if I<br>shall do it?' Ennis replied, ' how shall they<br>find  us out, when we are gone to England ?'<br>Miss - Thompson let me in, Kindly received me,<br>and shook me  by the hand . Ennis desired me<br>to put the handkerchief about Mrss Thompson's neck or face. I immediately fastened it <br>about her neck, and dragged her down the<br>staircase leading to the kitchen?the young<br>lady called  upon Ennis, and implored her to<br>help her. Ennis cried out ' Biddy, don't injure the young lady ' I replied, I have no in-<br>tention to hurt Miss Thompson?Ennis left<br>the house with a trunk?I had dragged Miss<br>Thompson two or  three steps down before<br>Ennis had left the house; but had not given<br>her a blow or any other injury at that time?<br>I pushed her down the stairs, until I got her <br>into  the kitchen?I then seized a poker and<br>began to beat her, and gave her  two blows on<br>the head  with it?Miss Thompson screamed,<br>and so did I?the  blood gushed out in tor-<br>rents?Miss Thompson then lay quiet- I rais-<br>ed her up in  my  arms, (cannot account for this <br>impulse) by  which my clothes became be-<br>smeared with blood."<p>Such is an account of this horrible transac-<br>tion, and which strikes the mind with horror ;<br>these two young females, in an evil hour, and<br>with the temptation of gain, murdered the un-<br>fortunate young lady, who, a few minutes be-<br>fore, bad shown them the greatest kindness,<br>and who never dreaded the errand upon which<br>they entered the  house, should operate as a<br>warning  to all young women, especially ser-<br>vants, to beware of jealousy, and to be clear<br>of ill-will to the persons whom they sus-<br>pect of being their foes.<p>W. Carse, Printer.</p>
