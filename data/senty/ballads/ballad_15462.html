	<p> AN&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ACCOUNT OF<p>THE&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;DEATH-BED  CONFESSIONS<p>OF<p>JEAN SIMPSON,<p>A respectable Midwife, who died in Falkirk, under<br>severe suffering from the loss of the use of her<br>limbs, but more especially the pangs of a guilty<br>conscience, with the fearful confession that she<br>made of having strangled no less than 20 little<br>innocents before they opened their infant eyes<br>in this world. The inhuman wretch, in her<br>last moments, told them of a chest, which on<br>being opened after her death, was found to con-<br>tain the skeletons of a great number of new<br>born babes.<p>The quiet and peaceable town of Falkirk was<br>thrown into the greatest state of excitement by a<br>rumour having been spread that a respectable mid.<br>wife, of the name of Jean Simpson, had made some<br>fearful disclosures on her death-bed. Jean was<br>an old favourite with the good women of the town,<br>and held in much esteem not only for her profes-<br>sional skill, but her strictly religious character,<br>which few doubted. Some indeed there were who<br>called in question her sanctimonious habits, and<br>even dared to pronounce her a hypocrite, and not<br>altogether what she should be as a midwife, for, as<br>they said, she was held in too great respect by the<br>young lassies who had come under her care. Things<br>passed on very well with Jean not with standing the<br>division of public opinion, until she caught a severe<br>cold, which confined her to bed for a considerable<br>time, but being recovered a little she ventured out<br>too soon, and even went a distance of some miles<br>to visit a favourite customer, who would permit no<br>other than Jean to attend her. This patient was<br>an unmarried female confined with her second child,<br>and Jean having been her confident with the first,<br>no other could be trusted on this trying occasion<br>but Jean Simpson, and, therefore, she had to attend<br>even at the risk of her life. The night was cold<br>and wet when the midwife went to visit her patient,<br>and consequently she relapsed. All the skill of the<br>Faculty proved unavailing, for her limbs began to<br>cease performing their wonted functions, and in a<br>short time she could not move a muscle of her<br>body, except the unruly member of her mouth,<br>which was a comfort to her in the last trying mo-<br>ment of dissolution, by easing her of the following<br>burden of crime. For a long time she carried on<br>her profession with strict propriety, but happening<br>to be engaged by a young woman where secrecy<br>was necesary to hide the guilt of the patient, it was<br>resolved that the infant should be disposed of in<br>the easiest manner. The deed was soon done, which<br>led the way to a fearful catalogue. Shortly before<br>expiring she told her to look into a chest which she<br>kept carefully concealed below her bed, for the pur-<br>pose of disposing of those little remains which were<br>destined never to be seen by any eye but that of<br>the dying penitent. She having expired in the<br>greatest agony on Tuesday morning, the 27th July<br>1841, the process of laying out the body was being<br>performed by two neighbours, but they soon disco-<br>vered that they had more than one corpse to dress ;<br>no less than the bodies of three infants were dis-<br>covered, and, horrible to relate, the chest was found<br>to be literally stuffed with the bones of new-born<br>babes, the fruits of a long course of child-murder.<p>Saunders, Printer.</p>
