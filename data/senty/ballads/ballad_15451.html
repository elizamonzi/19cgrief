	<h2>Transcription</h2>
	<p> Female  Prostitute.<p>A Melancholy account of a Female Prostitute, who died in a de-<br>plorable condition on the South Bridge Edinburgh, on the 18th<br>of this present month, April, 1824; also, an account of her life<br>and transactions for the last  21 years: this unfortunatevictim<br>of dissipation was born of respectable parents in Edinburgh, and<br>received an education sitted to adorn the sex.<br>WICKED COMPANIONS...<p>Before you receive this, my final state will be determined by the<br>Judge of all the earth, In a few drys at most, perhaps in a few<br>hours, the inevitable sentence will be passed, that shall raise me<br>to the heights of happiness or sink me to the depths of misery.<br>While you read these lines, I shall he either groaning under the<br>agonies of absolute despair, or triumphing in fullness of joy.<p>It is imposible for me to express the present disposition of my<br>soul?the vast uncertainty I am struggling with ! No words can<br>paint the force and vivacity of my apprehensions. Every doubt<br>wears the face of horror, and  would perfectly overwhelm me, but<br>for some faint beams of hope which dart across the tiemendous<br>gloom! what tongue can utter the anguish of a. soul suspended<br>between the extremes of infinite joy and eternal misery? I am<br>throwing my last stake for eternity, and tremble and sudder for<br>the important event.<p>Good God! how have I employed myself! what enchantment hath<br>held mo? in. what delirium & iniquity has my life been past? what<br>have I been doing, while the sun in its race, and the stars in.<br>their course, have lent their beams, perhaps, only to light me to<br>perdition!<p>I never awaked until now, I have just commenced the dignity of<br>a rational being. Till this instant I had a wrong apprehension of<br>every thing in nature I have pursued shadows & entertained my-<br>self with dreams. I have been treasuring up dust and sporting<br>myself with the wind. 1 look back, on my past life, and but for<br>some memorials of infamy and guilt it is all a blank a perfect<br>vacancy  I might have grazed with the beasts of the field, or sung<br>with the winged inhabitants in the woods to much better purpose<br>than any for which I have lived, and on. but for some saint hope;<br>a thousand limes more ; blessed had I been to have slept with the<br>lods of the valley, and never heard the Almighty fiat, nor waked<br>into life at his Command. I never had a just apprehension of the<br>solemuity of the part I am to act till now. Ye haunts of dissipa-<br>tion, how do you now stare me in the face! ye companions with<br>whom I have spent the bloom of youth in every wicked indul-<br>gence, were you here, you would learn the lesson, that one hour of<br>a death bed reflection will completely condemn a whole life spent<br>in the wirth and abominable practices of which you have been<br>guilty. It is not givmg np my breath; it is not being fer ever insen-<br>sible, is the thought at which 1 shrink; it is the terrible he reaster.<br>the something beyond the grave, at which you and I must recoil,<p>My awakened conscience feels something of that eternal ven-<br>geance I have often defied. To what heights of madness is it<br>possible to human nature to reach ? what extravagance is it to<br>jest with death : to laugh at damnation : to sport, with keternal<br>chains, and recreate a jovial fanecy with the scenes of eternal<br>misery. Every thing on earth seems to reproach this levity in<br>human creatures. A condemned wretch may, with as good a<br>grace, go dancing to the scaffold, as some of those with whom I<p>have associated, go with such thoughtless gaiety to their graves.<p>Wicked Companions, with what  horror do I recall those house.<br>or vanity I have lost! return ye wasted moments! how should I<br>prize you above the eastern treasures; let me dwell with hermits;<br>let me rest on the cold earth, let me converse in cottages, could I<br>but once more stand a candidate for an immortal crown, and<br>have my probation for celestial happiness. Which of you my<br>wicked companions, will answer my summons at the high Tribunal,<br>which of you will bail me from the stroke of death  who of you<br>will descend into the caverns of the grave for me. Here y who<br>leave me to carry on your former carrer; but remember, you [  ]<br>deceive and are deceived, that the horrors of a death bed [  ]<br> terrible to you as it has been to me. Tho' I have not rev,[  ] <br>ed the tenth part of what I know, <br>and you must shortly fee leave you ro your own choice, either to forsake your former ways<br>and gain eternal happiness, or persevere in your mad career,ang<br>reap eternal misery Adieu ! my proflicate companions, a long<br>adieu.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;S. G.<p>This woman died in a house which, from delicacy, we do not<br>mention, and was at one time, well  bred and educated, and of an<br>excellent character.</p>
