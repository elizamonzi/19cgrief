	<p> DONNELLY & COOPER.<p>Come all you true-born Irishmen wherever ye be,<br>I pray you give ottention; anh listen unto me;<br>It's of as true a story as ever you did hear,<br>About Donnelly and Cooper that fought at Kildare.<p>'Twas on the 3rd of June, my boys the challenge was sent o'er,<br>From Britunnia to old Granua to raise her sons once more,<br>To renew their satisfaction, and their credit to recall;<br>So they were in distraction since bold Donelly conquered all.<p>When Granua read the challenge, and received it with a smile,<br>You had better haste into Kildare, my well-beloved child,<br>It's there you will reign victorious, as you have always done before,<br>And your deeds will shine most glorious all around Hiberna's shore.<p>The challenge was accepted, and those noble lads did prepare,<br>To meet with Captain Kelly on the Curragh of Kildare,<br>The Englishmen bet ten to one that day against poor Dan,<br>But such odds as these would never dismay the blood of Irishman.<p>When these two bully champions they stripped in the ring,<br>They faced each other manfully, and to work they did begin,<br>From six till nine they sparred on, till Danny knocked him down,<br>Well done, my child, Granua smiled, this is ten thousand pounds.<p>The second round that Cooper fought he knocked down Donnelly,<br>But Dan had steel likewise true game, and rose most manfully,<br>Eight active then was Cooper and knocked Donnelly down once more<br>The English they all cried out, the battle you may give o'er.<p>The cheering of those English peers did make the vallys sound,<br>Whilst their English champion kept prancing on the ground,<br>Full ten to one they freely bet, on the ground whereon they stand,<br>That their brave hero would soon deceive their boasting Irishman,<p>Long life to Miss Kelly, she recorded on the plain,<br>She boldly stepped into the ring, saying, Dan, what do you mean ?<br>Saying, Dan, my boy, what do you mean, Hibernia's son, says she,<br>My whole estate I've bet on you, brave Donnelly.<p>When Donnelly received the fall after the second round,<br>He spoke to Captain Keliy, as ho lay on the ground,<br>Saying, do not fear, for I'm not beat, although I got two falls,<br>I'll let them know, before I go, I'll make them pay for all.<p>I'm not afraid, brave Donnelly, Miss Kelly she did say,<br>For I have bet my coach and four that you may gain the day;<br>You are a true born Irishman, the gentry well do know,<br>And on the plains of sweet Kildare this day their valour show.<p>Donnelly rose up again, and meeting with great might,<br>For to surprise the nobles all he continued for to fight,<br>Cooper stood on his own defence, exertion proved in vain,<br>He then received a temple blow which reeled him on the plain,<p>Ye sons of proud Britannia, your boasting now give o'er,<br>Since by our hero Donnelly, your hero is no more;<br>In eleven rounds he got nine knocks down, besides broke his jawbone<br>ghake hands, says she, brave Donnelly, the battle Is our own.<p>SILVER<br>BELLS.<p>In the hush of eventide,<br>Sitting by my cottage door,<br>Fancy softly seems to glide<br>Backward to the days of yore.<br>And I hear in changeful swells<br>Sweetest tones of melody,<br>'Tis the sound of silver bells,<br>Silver bells of memory.<p>Silver bells, silver bells,<br>Silver bells of memory ;<br>Silver bells, silver bells,<br>Silver bells of memory.<p>Many faces have grown old,<br>Many forms been laid to rest,<br>Underneath the churchyard mould,<br>Those I loved the most and best,<br>Since I've heard the distant swells<br>Floating on the winds to me,<br>Low and sweet the silver bells,<br>Silver bells of memory.<p>Now I seem to live once more,<br>All the dear, delightful past,<br>E'er the shadows long before<br>Sunny skies had overcast.<br>When we wandered in the dells,<br>Lingered in the flowery lea,<br>List'ning to the silver bells,<br>Now the bells of memory.<p>LARBOARD<p>WATCH.<p>At dreary midnight's cheerless hour,<br>Deserted e'en by Cynthia's beam,<br>When tempests beat, and torrents roar,<br>And twinkling stars no longer gleam,<br>The weary sailor spent with toil,<br>Clings firmly to the weather shrouds,<br>And still the lengthened hours beguile,<br>Sings as he views the gathering clouds,<br>Larboard watch, ahoy!<p>But who can speak the joy he feels,<br>While o'er the foam his vessel reels,<br>And his tired eyelids slumbering fall,<br>He rouses at the welcome call<br>Of Larboard watch, ahoy!<p>With anxious care he eyes each wave,<br>That swelling threatens to o'er whelm,<br>And, his storm-beaten bark to save,<br>Directs with skill the faithful helm;<br>With joy he drinks the cheering grog,<br>'Mid storms that bellow loud and hoarse,<br>With joy he heaves the reeling log,<br>And marks the lee way and the course,<br>Lardboard watch ahoy!<p>JAMES KAY, GLASGOW.</p>
