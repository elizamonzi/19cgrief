	<p> "The Deil's Boolin' Match"<p>ON<p>MONTROSE&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; GREEN.<p>The nicht was dismal, dark, and drear,<br>Nae lichtsome star did e'er appear<br>To gie the worthy burghers cheer<br>In Auld Montrose.<br>The boolin' green, as Egypt's night<br>Deserted, lay a waesome sicht,<br>For lang before, ilk joyful wight<br>Had sought repose.<p>Methought I waunered doon the brae<br>Where oft in simmer's golden day<br>I'd joined the boolers in their play<br>And merry pranks;<br>An' made leal freens and cronies dear,<br>Whose kindly welcome aye gave cheer.<br>I count them a' as richt guid gear,<br>An' tend them thanks.<p>That nicht, howe'er as Rab wad say,<br>The deil, some evil work wud hae,<br>Rampagin' roon to find some prey<br>Tae glut his ire ;<br>As shrieked the nor' wind ower the toon<br>A thund' rous crash rang out aboon,<br>An' to the sward the deil cam doon<br>In car o' fire.<p>He made straight for the boolhoose door<br>Twa red-hot bools dumped on the floor,<br>" I want a rink! " I heard his roar.<br>But a' was still.<br>"This nicht wi' mortals I maun wage<br>A deadly combat?here's the gage?<br>My crown and power ! " he yelled wi' rage.<br>" My roastin' grill! "<p>He bragged aboot his pooer and might;<br>Hoo nane could worst him in the fight.<br>"Twas plain tae see this deevlish wight<br>Was nae sma' drink.<br>" Come ! who will play ? "&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I heard the yell<br>As twelve boomed on the Steeple bell,<br>And then?" I'll tak' ye on mysel' !?<br>I'll skip a rink!"<p>Syne leaped my heart, I yelled oot " Fine !<br>This fechtin' wark is in your line! "<br>The deil glowered, " Ye're nae freen o' mine<br>At kirk or green."<br>'Twas Thomson, he o' heart sae leal,<br>Who bauldly faced his foe, the deil,<br>" I'll get a rink tae mak' ye squeal?<br>A rink sae keen."<p>An' in the twinklin' o' an eye<br>The stalwart form o' Marr I spy,<br>Followed by Martin?syne Mackay.<br>Weel picked the three.<br>For oft I'd seen them on the green<br>Contendin' stern as sportsmen keen ;<br>But now they'd sterner work, I ween,<br>To bear the gree.<p>" An' wha's your rink! " " E.T." did speir,<br>As ither ghoulish forms drew near.<br>" Deil's like mysel'!"&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Nick answered drear.<br>" Ye ken my sons ?<br>Macbeth and Nero, lang syne dead,<br>Fu' black an' grim the lives they led.<br>The Kaiser jinked me?sent in his stead<br>One o' the Huns !"<p>The game began, the bools flew fast,<br>An' ower the sward a gleam is cast<br>That ne'er on land or sea had passed<br>For mony a nicht;<br>Sin' Tam o' Shanter in the mirk<br>Saw phantoms revel in the kirk,<br>Syne chased him hame ower brae and birk?<br>An eerie sicht.<p>The deil's rink were a cunnin" crew<br>As to their maister's bid they drew,<br>An' frae the bools the fire sparks flew<br>When they were hit.<br>But Thomson's men strove micht an' main,<br>Tho' beaten yince they tried again,<br>An' " Clootie's " wiles were a' in vain<br>'Gainst Thomson's grit.<p>A goblin crood had lined the banks,<br>Rattlin' their fetters, chains and branks<br>(I saw some boolers in their ranks?<br>Some artfu' loons!)<br>They cheered their maister lang an' lood<br>Till Thomson lay a bool sae good?<br>Fair on the jack?he faced the crood<br>An' cracked his thooms.<p>The final end?the game was square,<br>Marr to the jack, an' inch, nae mair,<br>Had drawn a bool wi' muckle care ;<br>Sae did Mackay.<br>" Come on the fore !?juist draw tae me ! "<br>Thomson did cry wi' unfeigned glee.<br>"A bonny bool!&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Yer hand, ' W. P.'<br>That yin will lie ! "<p>The deil's lips wore an ugly grin<br>As doon the green his bool did spin.<br>It " wick'd " an' whummelled its way in<br>Straight to the kitty.<br>He danced an' pranced wi' muckle glee.<br>" The shot! " he cries;  " beat that," says he.<br>" Deil's luck is mine! "  Syne cried " E. T."?<br>"The mair's the pity ! "<p>Wi' lips stern set, the skip aimed true,<br>Straight for the jack his good bool flew;<br>Silent the goblin watchers grew;<br>Nae mair the boast.<br>Into the ditch went jack and bowl,<br>An' lay there safely cheek by jowl.<br>The deil let oot a waefu' howl?<br>" I've lost!&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I've lost! "<p>A thunder clap !?the air grew chill;<br>The storm had passed and all was still,<br>An' o'er the woods o' Rossie's hill<br>The moon arose.<br>The Steeple reared its spire on high,<br>I waked to see a starlit sky,<br>The deil had gone?without good-bye?<br>From Auld Montrose.<p>But on the green, as ye can see<br>The marks as plain as plain can be,<br>For Dakers pointed oot tae me<br>The very spot<br>Where Nickum's hinmpst bool had lain,<br>Till wi' that drive o' micht and main<br>The meenister the point hae taen,<br>An' won the shot.<p>R.
