	<h2>Transcription</h2>
	<p> A Letter from Helen Hutton, who<br>was Execute at Haddington,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;on<br>Friday last, the 25th of February,<br>written to her Mother a few Days<br>before her Execution.<p>Loving  Mother,<p>THis is to let you know that my dear Brother has taken much more<br>Pains both as to my Soul and Body, than ever I did deserve, and<br>especially, intreating me to tell all the Truth, for my poor<br>Soul's Accompt, desiring me always to take Care of what I<br>say, and to be very busy, and earnest in seeking for Mercy through Jesus Christ<br>our Redeemer and Saviour, in whom Mercy is only to be found, but not without<br>great Pains, before my poor Soul can be received, which I ought to be<br>minding most. As for the asked Truth I have laid it down, in so far as in me<br>lies, about the whole Action; and as for the horrid Murder I am most innocent,<br>but indeed I was in the Room with them that committed the Action, and<br>they threatned me most desperately with a Razor, to go and commit the said<br>Murder; but indeed I have great Reason to bless and Praise  my God of<br>Heaven, that did take so much Care of me, and kept my Hands free of it<br>as to my Innocence in the Action, when I was brought in, both by the Cap-<br>tain's Man and the Osler. The Gold and Silver Plate my Master had, did<br>intice them, and I not yielding to their Advice, was every Day in Danger of<br>my Life The Friday's Night before they committed the Murder, they<br>came and threatned me; and to save my Master and Mistresses Life, I de-<br>sired them to take mine; but it was not my Fortune to die that Death : So<br>I desire you dear Mother, that you will grieve as moderately for me as you<br>can, for Christ's Sake, my merciful Saviour, in whom, and through whose<br>Merits, I hope to obtain Salvation.<p>My Brother has taken all Pains about me, in getting Ministers to converse<br>with me, about my poor Immortal Soul, which is waiting patiently for its<br>Change, which I trust will be a happy One, I ought to praise my merciful good<br>GOD, that I am come the Length I am come, to see what a cursed Thing<br>Sin is, which I am daily helped to ; and wishes all Young and Old may take<br>Pains upon their Walk before GOD, wishing you my Sorrowful and offended<br>Mother, the Grace of Patience from the Liberal Hand of GOD, that giveth,<br>liberally, and upbraideth not. My dear Mother, I hope you will take this my<br>Dissolution from the Hand of God, who takes us out of the World to him-<br>self by very different Ways. You have done the Duty of a good<br>Parent to me, for which I Trust the good GOD, whom I have offended Times<br>beyond Number, will reward you. Lord grant you heavenly Com-<br>fort and Eternal Happiness, which is the hearty Wishes of me<br>your Daughter, who with Patience waits upon my Redeemer, who is<br>able and willing, to save to the Outermost all that come unto him, seeing<br>he everliveth to make Intercession for us; and he has given many great and<br>precious Promises for poor miserable Sinners, such as I am, he giveth Rest to<br>the weary Soul, he faith, Ho every one that thirsteth, come you to the Waters, and<br>you that have not Money, buy Wine and Milk, without Money and Price, to whose<br>Care and Protection I leave you and my dear kind Brother. In thee O Lord<br>I put my Trust.<p>I let you know, I die in Peace with all Men, and with these Two poor<br>Men, who accuse me falsly to the World, as I expect Forgiveness of my mer-<br>ciful sufficient Saviour Jesus Christ, whose Blood cleanseth all Sins. The<br>GOD of Peace who raised up Jesus from the Dead, be with you and all<br>Friends.<p>HELEN&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;HUTTON.<p>P. S. Excuse a trembling<br>Heart and Hand.<p><p>Edinburgh :&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Printed in the Year 1726<p></p>
