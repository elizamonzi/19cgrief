	<p>  DREADFUL<p>RIOT<p><p><p>Full and particular account of that  dreadful  and<p>bloody engagement which took place betwixt  a<p>party of Smugglers, and some men belonging to<p>the Preventive Service, on Wednesday last,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;at<p>St John's Haven, when three men  were most<p>cruelly murdered.<p>Wednesday last, information was given to the<br>Preventive party stationed near John's Haven,<br>through-some unknown channel, that  a person of<br>the name of Montgomery, a smuggler, well known<br>in that part of the country, was expected with a<br>valuable cargo of smuggled gin, tea, &c.<p>Accordingly, no pains were spared by the Pre-<br> ventive party to secure so valuable a prize. Every<br>means of defence were iustantly got ready, in case<br>Montgomery and his party, whose daring charac-<br>ters were se well kaown, should make any resist-<br>anee.<p>About two o'clock in the morning, when one of<br>the Preventive party was stationed on the ridge of<br>rocks, crlled the  Smuggler's  Cairn,  he observed<br>something at a short distance, which, upon minute<br>observation, turned out to be  a fishing boat,  used<br>in that part of the country for smuggling ;  he im-<br>mediately gava the signal to some of his&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;compan-<br>ions that a smuggler was in sight.<p>All hands instautly made for the place, and con<br>cealdd themselves at the back of the rocks that<br>abonnd on that coast.<p>In a few minutes Montgomery and his bold<br>companions, 15 in number, landed, and were or-<br>dered to surrender in the King's name, upon pain<br>of instant death.<p><p>This unexpected salute instantly told them what<br>customers they had to deal with. We shall never<br>yield was the instant reply of Montgomery. My<br>lads, 'tis at  most only man to man?sink the cus-<br>toms, and vengeance for the past. In an instant<br>shot and grape, accompanied with the clashing of<br>swords, gave dreadful note of the bloody affray.<p>Montgomery, with his little, but gallant band,<br>fought to the last,  and only left the scene of action<br>when three of his companions lay weltering in their<br>gore, Seven preventive-men were wounded, some<br>of them dangerously.<p>We are convinced, that the happy and efficieat<br>system of policy acted upon by our present Minis-<br>ters  will prevent a similar occurpence.<p> Printed for Fergus Ferguson.
