Yes, one; Jack the Coachmaker.<p>Ques. Who is it that by common consent is set down as the most shallow, arro-<br>gant, presumptuous, conceited and self-sufficient coxcomb that ever wriggled itself<br>into notoriety, or escaped being breached for its habitual impertinence ??Ans. Jack<br>the Coachmaker.<p>Ques. Who is that fawns on and cringes to his superiors, enacting to a marvel<br>the part of Macsycophant, whilst towards his inferiors and dependants he plays the<br>petty tyrant, comineering and swaggering with characteristic insolence ??Ans. JACK<br>THE COACHMAKER.<p>Ques. Who is it that, having once proposed to " chuck" the Kirks to the Devil<br>or Jack Robison, now pathetically undertakes to die for Religion ??Ans.

Who is it that affects to consider the friendship of Childe Harold as a dis-<br>honour, and the fact of companionship with the the great Poet of Liberty, who died<br>a martyr to the cause hallowed by his genius and inspiration, as presumptive evi-<br>dence of irreligion ??Ans. Ye Gods ! JACK THE COACHMAKER.<p>Ques. Who is it that having been recently Whig and Reformer, has now Ratted<br>back to the Tories, in the hope of stepping into Parliament on their shoulders? ?<br>Ans. Jack the Coachmaker.<p>Ques.

Who is it that, calling himself a man of business, first declared the  finan-<br>ces of the Corporation of Edinburgh in a flourishing condition, and the assets to the<br>debts, as thirty to twenty, yet afterwards took credit to himself for making the as-<br>tounding discovery that this flourishing Corporation was in a state of insolvency ??<br>Ans. Jack the Coachmaker.<p>Ques. Who is it that, whilst the affairs of the city were in this condition, bank-<br>ruptcy impending, deliberately cast into the great gulf, where it was swallowed up<br>and, the fund which the benevolence of Dr Bell had set apart for educating the<br>poor of this city, which he now proposes to represent in Parliament??Jack the<br>Coachmaker.<p>Ques. Who is it that stood forth as sponsor to the odious and infamous Community<br>Estate Bill, the real object of which was to saddle on the citizens for ever and a day<br>the consequences of the gross mismanagement meat of self-elected and irresponsible Coun-<br>cils, and thus practically to destroy, or, at least, render wholly inoperative the<br>Burgh Reform which had recently before been obtained ??Ans. Jack the Coachman.<p>Ques. Who is it that first abused and maligned the deputation sent by the Inhabi-<br>tants' Committee to watch and control his proceedings,?then attempted to sneak<br>into the favour of those he had traduced,?then consented, when he could not help<br>himself, to give up the more obnoxious parts of his famous bill,?and, lastly, when<br>his hateful measure has been pruned and weeded of its abominations, returned to<br>Edinburgh, and openly boasted in Council that he had succeeded in carrying every<br>object originally contemplated by him ? Ans. JACK THE COACHMAKER.<p>Ques. And who is it that, with this rare stock of merit at his back, now offers<br>himself on the Tory interest, as a Candidate for tho suffrages of the Citizens of Edin-<br>burgh? Ans. Why 'tis JACK THE COACHMAKER.<p>Ques. But will they have him, strange mixture as he is of gironette, coxcomb and<br>double apostate, with such things to answer for besides ? Ans.
