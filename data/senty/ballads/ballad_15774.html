	<p> The last Speech and dying Words of Mar-<br>garet Millar, Coal-bearer at Colden-cleugh<br>who was execute 10. February I726 at<br>the Gibbet of Dalkeith, for Murdering<br>her own Child.<p>My Friends,<p>THE present Age is so degenerate into Vice and Immorality, That they<br>have the Ascendant Godliness and Vertue ; whereas Religion and<br>Piety are run down by manifest Profanity, Dissimulation and Hypocrisy :<br>So the Sin of unnatural Murder (while one Relation  barbarously em-<br>brues their cruel Hands in the innocent Blood of another)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Parents theirs in<br>the Blood of their tender Children, the Children theirs in that of their dutiful and<br>affectionate Parents: And in short, That of the Inhuman  and cruel Servants( for the<br>love of Money) barbarously butchering their kind and obliging Masters and Mistres-<br>ses That all these horrid Actions and abominable Sins, are the ready Means to bring<br>down the heavy and just Judgments of GOD upon a People, or Person, who avow-<br>edly do commit the same, and whatever Secrefy may be gone about, in&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the Per-<br>petradon of any of  these, yet the all-seeing Eye of the Almighty&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;will bring the<br>hidden Things of Darkness to Light, That the guilty Offenders may by the Hand<br>of Justice be brought to condign Punishment, for a Terror and Example to others,<br>who shall or may be guilty of the like Crimes.<p>Dear People, since I am by the just Sentence of the Law, condemned to suffer<br>this Day a shameful and cursed Death, for that unnatural and cruel Fact, it will<br>be expected by you all, to hear something from me, as to the course of my frail<br>Life, which is now near to a Period.<p>The place of my Birth was at Dysert in Fife. My Father John Millar was a Salter<br>under my Lord Sinclar there, and I being in my Nonage left to the Care of an<br>Uncle, who put me to the Fostering, and after being wean'd from the Breast, was<br>turn'd from Hand to Hand amongst other Relations, when my Friends being wearied<br>and neglecting me, I was obliged to engage with my Lord Sinclar's Coalliers to be<br>a Bearer in his Lordships Coalheughs:  So being unaccustomed with that Yoke<br>of Bondage, I endeavoured to make my Escape from such a World of Slavery, ex-<br>pecting to have made some better thereof: But in place of that I fell into a greater<br>Snare; which was in a Millers House near unto Lithgow, where my Masters<br>Son and I fell into that Sin of Uncleanness, and I brought forth a Child unto him; <br>which Child was fostered, and lived until it was three or four Years of Age, and<br>died in the small Pox.<p>After which Time, I came from the foresaid Service into this Place, where  I<br>engaged in the Coal-heugh of Coldencleugh, under the Service of Christian Lums-<br>den, which I most solemonly regrate this Day, and which was my Misfortune, she re-<br>duced me to great Extremities, by not paying up of my Wages, so duely as I was<br>needful of it, to buy me Cloaths to go to the House of GOD upon his Day, which<br>made me to ran into an Hurry of Dispar, my Land-Lady and others in the Coal-<br>heugh suspecting I had an Ear with George Lauder Coal-grieve there, began to<br>make Reflections upon me, which prompted me to greater Vice, as most unhappily<br>hath now fallen out:  Which Vice hath brought me to this unhappy and untimely<br>End ; he having had that Opportunity of inducing me into that horrid Sin of Adul-<br>try, and after which Time I came to be with Child to him, I acquainted him there-<br>of, and when the Time of Birth came, I finding no Subsistance from him, I did.<br>most unnaturally imbrue my Hands in the innocent Blood of the Fruit of my<br>Womb.<p>I must own, that even in ray younger Years I was addicted to all Vice,such as ne-<br>glecting Duty towards G O D, Breach of his Sabbath, and neglecting of his Ordi-<br>nances: Now I desire that all Persons take a warning of me this Day who am<br>but an Ignorant, or a Castaway, That they be not Breakers of the Sabbath, Despisers<br>of his Ordinances left that their End be such an untimely one as mine.<p>F I N I S</p>
