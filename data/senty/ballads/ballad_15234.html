	<p> WILLlAM  BURKE'S<p>MURDERS IN THE WESTPORT.<p>Ye people of Scotland give ear to this sad tale,<br>It will make your hearts burn, and your faces turn pale,<br>Concerning a deed which has lately been done,<br>The like was ne'er heard of since the world begun.<p>In Edinburgh there lived a man and his wife,<br>In horrid transactions they passed their life,<br>Its deed after deed they did quickly pursue,<br>No terror had they, nor a thought for to rue.<p>The first charge against them was of a dark liue,<br>But be it true or be it false hereafter will shew,<br>Mary Paterson from Glasgow, her life it was ta'en,<br>Without any cause but for real greed of gain<p>The next it this black list of crime, we hear,<br>Was a man of weak parts to humanity dear,<br>His name was James Wilson?how awful the thought,<br>It is said they did murder, though he sore with them fought.<p>A third uow appears in this blood stained scroll,<br>To wound every feeling and harrow the soul,<br>A poor widow woman in search of her son,<br>Is waylaid, invited, and then quite undone.<p>To the house of this blood-hound, she's asked for to rest.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  <br>Then they did treat her with drink not the best,<br>And while in this state a sham scuffle began,<br>Between Burke the murderer, and one of his clan.<p>In this unmanly fight the woman she rose,<br>As well as she could, to stop, the blows,<br>And while in this act she was knock'd to the floor,<br>And the women, to screen, then ran to the door,<p>The base hearted coward, whose name is called Hare,<br>As soon as he did it, Burke managed the snare,<br>He fell on her body, and stiffled her so,<br>That death it did follow, and forc'd blood it did flow.<p>This scene being over, she quickly is laid,<br>And wrapped in straw is thrown under the<br>And while is this slate, the liquor goes round,<br>And nothing but mirth and full glasses abound.<p>Sometime after this her body is sent,<br>In charge of a porter by the parties consent,<br>To the house of a Doctor who they knew would be found,<br>And for this horrid action received ten pound.<p>But lo ! while dividing their blood gotten gear,<br>What a sight does appal them ! the Policemen appear,<br>Each countenance changes, when them they behold,<br>The hearts that were glad are now cheerless and cold.<p>To the bar o justice they quickly are led,<br>To answer for innocent blood they had shed,<br>The man was convicted, the woman got clear,<br>But a troubled conscience she surely must bear.<p>A crime, such as this, was ne'er heard in our land,<br>It makes the heart shudder, the hair straight to stand,<br>To think that such murders for sake of a fee,<br>By a GANG of MONSTERS committed should be.<p> The following case excited considerable interest as <br>well as amusement :? A man and his wife, apparently<br>natives of the Highlands , charged a respectable look- <br>ing young man, with having,, on the preceding even-<br>ing, attempted to carry off their child, a girl of three<br>or four years old, from the stair in which they lived,<br>for the purposes (as they said he looked like a young<br>doctor) of dissection . The young man stated that he<br>was coming down the stair, and stumbling upon a<br>child in the dark, he lifted it up from fear of hurting<br>it. The girl, however, into whom a salutary fear of<br>the doctor, seemed, to have been carefully instilled,<br>screamed out in such a manner, as to bring a crowd<br>instantly around them; and the father and mother in-<br>sisted on fixing the present absurd charge upon him,<br>the defender, who stated, moreover, that he was a <br>painter, and not a surgeon. The Magistrate, of course,<br>dismissed the case; but the poor people retired in the<br>firm persuasion that the defender, if he was not a<br>doctor himself, had certainly intended to deliver the<br>child into their hands.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
