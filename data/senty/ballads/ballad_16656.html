	<p> The DEADLY GROANS of the WHISKY STILLS.<br>Who were cohdcmned to suffer Martyrdom on the 17th of this present<br>month of July 1795, for the horrid and bloody murder of sterving<br>above 200,000 prosessed Christians in this island.<p>With the sorrowful Lamentation of all the Dram Drinker's.<p>COME all ye that are fond of me, it is to<br>you that I now For this time address myself,<br>Oh my dear friends, you have no doubt, heard<br>of the fatal stroke that I am about to receive<br>on the 17th of this present month, and in or-<br>der that you may pity me now under the sen-<br>tence of almost total annihilation from society,<br>especially those of my greatest admiters; Oh,<br>  my dear friends, what will now become of you,<br>who clasped me into your very bosom every<br>morning ! you will no more court me upon so<br>easy terms as you have hitherto done.<p>It will be necessary, in order that you may<br>condole with me, that you know my name and<br>designation ; it is true 1 have got a great many<br>names, or as I should rather call them nick-<br>names, which differ very materially from that<br>which I first had, which was Aquavitae, or<br>more properly speaking the water of life; the<br>name I generally go by at this day is WHISKY,<br>a name which differs very much from the<br>original of my origin ; but those who were my<br>real friends, always gave me a new name, which<br>I the more readily put up with as I knew them<br>to be my real admires, and it now gives me the<br>greatest effacation, that I must be sorever bani-<br>shed from the society of all those, who took so<br>much delight in my company, and was always<br>happy, when they had me stending on the table<br>before them. My friend would say to his<br>neighbour, will you take a dram, or will you<br>take a caulker, or will you taste the blue this<br>morning, you will be much the better of it; and<br>if my friend and lover got his neighbour to par-<br>take of me it was rarely that he lost any thing<br>by introducing me to his acquaintance, for I<br>very often was returned with new strength, and<br>I was swallowed up with the greatest delight in<br>mouthfuls; and such as were dumb, I made<br>them speak with the greatest case by the time<br>I had touched their tongue with half a dozen of<br>fills of my little christal Jacket, my dear could<br>talk of politicks, and the weighty affairs of state,<br>with the greatest volatility, and case. I then<br>could beat the French with big words & strange<br>grimaces.<p>Our wise legislators, who are no doubt,<br>possessed with a great deal of wisdom have fat<br>upon me, tried and condemned me to six months<p>annihilation, not for any crime that they found<br>in me, but that I was destructive to that poor<br>diminitive grain called Barley, which few or<br>none can make use of until it be metamorpho-<br>sed into my pure and christaline form. May,<br>in this transparent colour I have added thou-<br>sands to his Majest's forces, and for all these<br>good offices I have done, I am doom'd to<br>destruction.<p>And there is nothing hurts me more, than<br>that of a temporary death, it ever I come a-<br>gain into existence, I am much afraid that many<br>of my most intimate acquaintance will be gone<br>sorever to the place of oblivion, for want of<br>that comfort which I usually gave to those<br>who were my hourly companions.<p>It has been often said that I was the death<br>of thoufands of the leige subjects, but I can in-<br>controvertibly prove that those who have for-<br>saken, and given over taking me into their bo-<br>soms, have died very soon thereafter, whilst<br>those who have continued by me, are living<br>witnesses of the truth of what I aver, and I<br>am certain before the end of January thousands<br>will die with the greatest heaviness on their<br>spirits for the want of ME to comforts them.<p>It is now proposed that all those who are<br>possessed of Stills, will send them into the dif-<br>ferent barracks, now erected in the kingdom,<br>in purpose that their masters may not be oblig-<br>ed to pay rent for useless utenfils. and to ga-<br>ther all the lick sticks in the island to watch<br>them; and as they will be out of employ-<br>ment, and for tear of them getting a bad<br>habit of idleness, it will be requisite they<br>undergo the exercise of their duty, in case<br>they forget how to perform it when rhey<br>are again set agoing, And besides this it will<br>be another advantage, as they will defend the<br>barracks, while our brave soldiers are keeping<br>the French from landing on our Coasts; and if<br>this employment shall be found to be too little<br>for them to distill a little now and then of a supe-<br>rior strength, in order to manufacturs powder<br>with It, to shoot at the French if they shall<br>attempt a landing, and if they should, dare to<br>land, these idle gentry will be ready to destroy<br>whatever may remain, for fear of these banditi<br>getting possession of it, as the Cormagnols are<br>said to fight best when they have got drunk,</p>
