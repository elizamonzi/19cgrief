	<p> Fatal Love!<p>Or an account of that Cruel and Inhuman Murder which was committed on the body<br>of MARY JOHNSTON, a young Sertant Girl, near Blackburn, on Friday last.<br>July 4th, 1823, by JOHN WATSON, Cotton-spinner, in the same place, who<br>pretended to be Sweetheart. Also, a copy of the Letter sent by him in order to de-<br>coy her to the place where he committed the horrid deed, with the young women's<br>answer.<p>THE unfortunate woman who is the subject of our history, was born of ho-<br> nest labouring parents, who learned her to read write, and breb her up to<br>rabits of industry :?When old enough she went to service, ann lived at several<br>places of reputation. Being a comely woman, she had several sweethearts, and<br>had not attained her 18th year when she became acquainted with one John Wat-<br>son, a Cotton spinner, who lived in the neighbourhood of Blackburn. Being a<br>comely young man, and having much to say for himself, be soon gained her<br>love. She believed him sincere, not reflecting that<p>" Man was made for to deceive,<br>" And silly women to believe."<p>As they lived near each other, their meetings were frequent, and his promises<br>of marriage so repeatedly made, that she vainly flattered herself the time was nor<br>far distant when she should be united to a person she sincerely loved, and be<br>happy. But John was all deceit, and aimed at her ruin ; which, under promise<br>of marriage, and various other sacrifices, he completely effected. Repeated meet-<br>ngs of criminality produced the usual consequences, and the deluded girl found<br>herself pregnant, with the addition of her misery, that where she expected the<br>most comfort she found the least, for Watson not only evaded his promises, but<br>entirely forsook her. She seldom saw him but when she did, met with cold in-<br>difference and ill treatment, where he once loved he now hated, and he was con-<br>tinually ruminating how to get red of her and the infant in her womb. This<br>cruel treatment of an unfortunate girl whom he seduced was increased by fixing<br>his eyes on a farmers daughter, whose uncle had left her 400l. and he was de-<br>termined if possible to obtain her hand. The only obstacle to this was the preg-<br>nancy of Mary Johnston, for he had conversed with the other young woman,<br>and every thing seemed to favour his wishes. He formed various schemes to<br>get rid of the poor girl, till at length the devil put it into his head to murder her.<br>The dreadful resolution being once formed, the next consideration was how to<br>effect if. He resolved to decoy her out, on the following Sunday, to a private place<br>and there perpetrate the bloody deed. In pursuance of this plan he sent the fol-<br>lowing letter by a young man who assisted him in the same mill:?<p>"Dear Mary,?I hope these few lines will find you in good health, as I am a<br>present, they are sent to let know, I would be glad if you could contrive to meet<br>me about four o'clock to-morrow afternoon, and I will wait for you in the lane<br>below farmer Brown's fields, I beg you will not fail coming, as I have something<br>to propose to you which may be of the greatest benefit to us ; no more at present<br>from your loving friend, JOHN WATSON."&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  On receiving this letter<p>she was some what comforted, and having obtained leave to go out on  Friday<br>she sent the following answer :?&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <p>" Dear John,?Your affectionate letter has revived my drooping spirits ; and<br>God knows I have need of some comfort under my afflictions, which I have by<br>my indiscretion brought upon myself. I will not fail of meeting you at the<br>place appointed ; and till then I remain yours, the afflicted MARY JOHNSTON.<br>Punctual to the time, she met him at the appointed place, when, after walking<br>together till they came to an unfrenquented path, they sat down on a bank.<br>Here, putting his arms round her neck, as if going to kiss her, he, with a knife<br>which he had concealed in his hand, cut her throat in a dreadful manner, then<br>dragged her body to a ditch, threw in, and covered it with brambles. Thus hav-<br>ing perpetrated the cruel sct, he staid out till dark, when he returned home and<br>shifted his clothes, which had a great deal of blood upon them. The poor girl's<br>mistress was very uneasy at her staying out all night, snd every enquiry the next<br>day without hearing any tidings of her, and 'Watson, being questioned, denied<br>being in her company on Friday. As she had observed to be in a melancholy<br>way, a suspicion arose that she had destroyed herself. Her father and others<br>searched the ponds and fields round about, and at lenght observed some blood,<br>which they traced to a ditch, and there found the body. Watson was apprehend-<br>ed, on searching his house his bloody clothes were found, and in one of his pock-<br>ets the letter he received from the deceased. At his examination he denied know-<br>ing any thing of the girl, but being strictly questioned, and his conscience flying<br>in his face, " You villian!" said the Justice, " you have murdered the girl!" He<br>confessed the whole, and how he disposed of the body. He was then commit-<br>ted to prison fortrial Edinburgh ....Printed, for John Thom. Price One Penny.</p>
