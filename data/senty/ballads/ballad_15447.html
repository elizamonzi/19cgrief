	<h2>Transcription</h2>
	<p> An account of that Fatal Quarrel which took<br>place between Mr Mathieson (public house<br>keeper in North Fowlis's Close, High Street,)<br>and his wife, on Wednesday last ; when, in<br>consequence of violent blows received from her<br>husband, she was taken to the Infirmary;<br>where, after being delvered of a still-born ehild<br>she died on Saturday last, 27th March.<p>On Wednesday, the 24th day of' March, 1824, a man of<br>the name of Mathieson, who keeps a. public house in<br> North Fowlis's Close, High Street, quarrelled with his<br>wife, and struck her repeatedly several violent blows.<br>Reports say that some of the wounds were inflicted with<br>a bottle, and that the quarrel originated in Mrs Mathieson<br>having admitted into the house some women of bad<br>character. The woman being far advanced in a state of<br>pregnancy, became very ill, and.was removed to the In-<br>firmary, where, after giving birth to a dead-born child,<br>she died on Saturday morning, 27th March. The man<br>has been lodged in jail, in order to stand trial for the<br>horrid deed.<p>MELANCHOLY ACCIDENT.<p>Inverness, March 25th.<p>We have seldom the mournful task to record so melan-<br>choly an accident as happened in our vicinity last week.<br>A person engaged in building a house near the Caledonian<br>Canal, employed four men from Clacknaharry to convey<br>stones from the Redcastle Quarry, on Saturday last. The<br>boat employed on this occasion was old and insecure,' and<br>on her return, from the quarry deeply laden, sunk at a dis-<br>tance of about two hundred yards from the Redcastle Pier,<br>when, melancholy to relate, the employer and whole crew<br>perished. Four of these men were married, and have left<br>widows, and a number of helpless children to deplore their<br>fate. The other was a young man who supported his<br>aged and infirm relatives. The bodies were found as the<br>tide retired, and conveyed next day to Clachnaharry,<br>where a scene of distress ensued among their families and<br>neighbours which we need not describe.<p>MELANCHOLY SUICIDE.<p>London, March 1824.<p>A painful sensation was excited at the west end of the<br>town on Wednesday, 24th March, in consequence of a ru-<br>which obtained circulation, that a naval officer of high<br>rank had put a period to his existence....On inquiry, this<br>rumour was not without foundation, and that the unfortu-<br>nate individual who had thus fallen by his own hand, was<br>George Ralph Collier, K. C. B. a Captain in the Royal<br>Navy. This gallant officer, it appears, had been residing<br>for some time back at Gordon's Hotel, in Albemarle-street,<br>and during that period was observed to be considerably<br>depressed in spirits. On Tuesday he called at the United<br>Service Club-house, of which he was a member, and here<br>he shewed strong symptoms of irritation, in consequenco<br>of some severe strictures upon his conduct, which he said<br>were contained in 'James's  Naval History." On Wed-<br>nesday morning, his feelings ware again excited to a state<br>of momentary phrenzy, and, while labouring under this<br>paroxysm, he seized a pistol, and in a moment deprived<br>himself of life.<br>  Edinburgh?Printed for Alexander Brown.</p>
