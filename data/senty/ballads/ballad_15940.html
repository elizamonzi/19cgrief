	<p> Grand Cavalcad'e<p>OF THE&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <p>SONS OF CRISPIN,<p>FROM&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  <p>Holyrood-House<p>TO THE<p>Calton Convening Halt,<p>REGENT BRIDGE, <p>On THURSDAY, the 25th October 1821.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<p>AT a very Numerous and highly Respectable Meeting of the<br>Sons of Crispin held last Night (Oct. 24th), the Prince of Cord-<br>wainers in the Chair, it was resolved, una voce, that as our Civic<br>Rulers had thought proper, from some cankered or ill-humoured<br>motive, to prevent their intended procession, they were determin-<br>ed to form a Cavalcade in open Coaches, which took place accord-<br>ingly this day (25tli), at 4 o'clock.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <p>ORDER OF THE PROCESSION.<p>The KING, in an open Baroche, accompanied by his Two Pages.<br>His Majesty appeared in good health and spirils.<br>The State Coach was drawn by Four Beautiful Arabians, and the<br>Coachman and Grooms, in Splendid Liveries, had their -<br>top-pieces surmounted by large three-deckers,<br>embellished with huge Cockades.<p>The Costume which the Sovereign wore, was truly becoming the<br>dignity of his exalted character.?His Pages were beautiful<br>Young Lads, adorned in the first style of Elegance. The Cham-<br>pion, brave and daring, whose very glance struck the Beholders<br>with profound awe. A number of Coaches, with Prime Ministers,<br>Ambassadors, and Officers of State. The Black Prince, with his<br>Supporters, followed by a long train of Coachcs, containing, no<br>doubt, Lord Mayors, Lord Provosts, Magistrates, Sheriffs, Com-  <br>mon Council Men, &c. &c.?'.<p>We cannot withhold our sympathy from these respectable and<br>highly distinguished sons of Wax We certainly were greatly dis-<br>appointed in our ardent anticipations of the superb spectacle which<br>-we expected to witness this day on the streets of our ancient, free,<br>and independent city. This is', however, in some sort compensat-<br>ed by the Resolutions of last night; for though far inferior to<br>what was expected, the Procession was this day far from being<br>contemptible, and really exceeded our most sangume expectations.<p>When we contemplate the unusual pains and labour which the<br>wives and sweethearts of the Last and Instep-leather must have<br>endured in order to equip their Saint Monday lovers for the occa-<br>? sion, it is truly deplorable. It would not be at all surprising to<br>hear of some of them going to inhabit the cells near the Meadow<br>Walk, notwithstanding the use of frequent applications of that<br>never-failing specific, the Kippen restorative, or Barley Broth.<p>Mrs Insole, Mrs Outsole, Mrs Welt, Mrs Ran, Mrs Upperleather,<br>Mrs Lift, Mrs Top-piece, Mrs. Stirrup, Mrs Lasting-lack, Mrs<br>Paste, Mrs Hemp,' Mrs Wax Mrs Hairs, Mrs Heelball, with seye-<br>ral other ladies of distinction, have agreed to spend an evening<br>together, and form themselves into a Select Committee, for the<br>purpose, as far as in them lies. of redressing their own and their<br>husbands grievances. Many of these Ladies were actually em-<br>ployed all night on the 24th, endeavouring to restore their dear<br>husbands only shirt to its primitive Colour, soap, ashes, soda, boil-<br>ing, washing,- rincing, in short every means which their fertile ima-<br>gination could devise, were employed for this laudable purpose.</p>
