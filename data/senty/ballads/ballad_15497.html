	<p> EXECUTION.<p>A Full and Particular Account of the Execution of<br>Thomas Conner and Bell M'Menemy, who were<br>Executed at Glasgow on Wednesday Morning, the<br>22d October 1828, for Assault and Robbery; to-<br>gether with their Behaviour since their Condemna-<br>tion, and at the place of Execution.<p>It will be recollected that the unfortunate persons above alluded<br>to, Thomus Conner and Bell M'Menemy, were tried at the last<br>Circuit Court of Justiciary at Glasgow, for Assault and Robbery,<br>in so far as they were guilty of, on the 20th of May last, assault-<br>ing Alexander M'Kinnon, from Tralee, who came to Glasgow to<br>sell Eggs, and who stated the Case as follows :?" Was in Glasgow<br>20th May last, and came with a wherry to sell eggs ; sold his egg,<br>and had about £ 8 in notes, and £ 2 in silver, and some copper,<br>before the robbery took place. The notes he had in a stocking on<br>his leg ; the silver was in the other stocking. Between Monday<br>night and Tuesday morning, on the night he was assaulted, met a<br>woman, and went into a house with her and had one gill of whisky.<br>This took place in Glasgow. The prisoner M'Menemy was the<br>woman; M'Menemy followed witness after he had left the house, and<br>when at the Bromielaw Bridge, M'Menemy said she would take<br>him to a house. They went together, and on the road met a<br>watchman, who spoke to M'Menemy ; this was on their way to<br>the Aqueduct Bridge. Further on M'Menemy met a man whom<br>she said was her brother. Prisoner (M'Menemy) wanted witness<br>to sit down, but he would not do so, and the man they met canght<br>him by the neckcloth  got a blow also on the head, which made<br>him senseless. On coming to himself, he found his silver gone <br>missed a pair of shoes, and a stocking which contained the silver ;<br>the stocking was left, but the money in it gone. Before he was<br>knocked on the head, there came up another man , thinks the<br>prisoner Richardson was the person who twisted his neckcloth;<br>identities his shoes as those he lost : two policemen went back to<br>place where he was robbed, and found the empty stocking; there<br>was much blood on the ground; beside the spot there was a<br>brick. Witness was very weak and sore, and severely cut in the<br>head from the blows he had got, and has not done much good since<br>The stone shewn is like the one he saw lying near where he<br>was robbed. Indentifies a bloody shirt as being his. The night<br>was dark.<p>They were both found Guilty by the Jury,?M'Menemy, in<br>terms of her own confession ; and Conner by the evidence ; but on<br>account of his youth was recommended to mercy.<p>Lord Meadowbank then addressed Conner. He said that he<br>thought he would not again have appeared at that bar, as the sin-<br>gular escape he had made about six years ago, would have given<br>him a sufficient warning. His hardihood in crime, however, was<br>by no means allayed, and the law must now take its course.<br>Conner and M'Menemy were then sentenced to be executed on<br>Wednesday the 23d October, betwixt the hours of eight and ten<br>morning. Conner appears to be about 25 years old, and M'Me-<br>nemy nearly the some age.<p>They accordingly suffered this day in front of the New Jail.<br>The woman has been very penitent, indeed, since her condemna-<br>tion, and  acknowledged her Guilt in the most unqualified terms.<br>Conner also admitted the justice of his sentence, and mentioned<br>that he ought to have taken warning from his former conviction,<br>but that he could not.<p>Soon after eight o'clock the Magistrates were in attendance,<br>when the prisoners were brought forward. A psalm was then<br>sung, and a prayer offered up by one the Rev. Clergymen present.<p>After which they proceeded to the Scaffold, where another psalm<br>was sung, and a prayer fervently offered up in behalf of the un-<br>fortunate prisoners. They saluted one another, and shook hand<br>with those around them. They then mounted the fatal Drop, and<br>after praying fervently for a few minutes, the signal was dropt, and<br>they were instantly launched into eternity, amidst a great con-<br>course of spectators, it being an unusual sight to see a woman exe-<br>-cuted in Scotland.<p>PRICE ONE PENNY.</p>
