	<p> ELEGY<p>AND<p>EPITAPH<p>ON<p>Thomas Williams,<p>Late Dempster, or Hangman, of the City<br>of Edinburgh,<p>Who died the 5th of January 1833, aged 66 years.<br>He was upwards of 12 years in that capacity,<br>and conducted himself with wonderful propriety, <br>which few does in his line. This shows, that<br>whatever occupation in life we follow, a man may<br>keep his character somewhat blameless. He has<br>left a widow and two children, that paid every<br>attention to him during his trouble. He be-<br>longed to four different regiments, and was be-<br>loved by his officers and comrades,?the dis-<br>charges from each regiment will certify the<br>statement, but had no pension, as was erroneous-<br>ly stated, in a spurious publication previously<br>published.<p>ELEGY.<p>SCARCE had the infant year begun,<br>A time when Scottish folk mak' fun,<br>They tak' their social friendly run<br>Half fu' that day.<p>Some rise to drink?some rise to eat?<br>Whilst many rise, alas ! to greet,<br>By loss o' friends, lie cold as sleet<br>By Death that day.<p>Such happen'd in a house weel kent, *<br>A house wha's tenant pays nae rent,<br>Because to him it's only lent<br>From day to day ;<p>Just like oursel's, wou'd we reflect,<br>This frame to us is only let;<br>But we, like bairns, may tak' the pet,<br>And flit some day.<p>Sic themes as these?think shame to tell,<br>To flit from earth, by dint o' sel',<br>The common d------d, shun them in hell,<br>Wi' fright that day.<p>TAM WILLIAMS died a strae-bed. death ;<br>To leave his birth he wou'd been laith,<br>An inflamation stopt his breath,<br>Sair pain'd that day.<p>No sooner had he ta'en his flight,<br>When many, many weary wight,<br>Petitioning for his birth that night,<br>Wi' speed that day.<p>But to our Elegy, be brief,<br>He that o' life deprives the thief,<br>Unless he turns o'er a new leaf,<br>Fu' quick some day.<p>Yes, TAMMIE WILLIAMS is fairly gone,<br>An' left a widow sore to moan ;<br>But our gude town?tho' made o' stone,<br>Provides that day.<p>EPITAPH.<p>HERE lies TAM WILLIAMS, our city Dempster, <br>At times he was right social good ;<br>He was the Prince of ony Hemp-ster,<br>But now, alas ! for worm she's food.<br>His trust in Him, when in distress, <br>Altho' he had a hangman's faut,<br>Nae doubt he hung up many a GLASS,<br>But tell me wha hates juice o' maut ?<p>The Magistrates of Edinburgh caused him to be buried<br>respectably, in the Greyfriars' Church Yard, on Tues-<br>day evening, the 8th January, in as quiet a manner as<br>possible, under the direction of his son, which took place<br>at about half-past five, by the light of the Moon.<p>*  Foot of Old Fishmarket Close.<p> ?Hangman, or Doomster.<p>?All the time of his illness the Bible was his only book.</p>
