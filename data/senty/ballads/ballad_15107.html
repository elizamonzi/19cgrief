	<p> Jessie at the Railway Bar.<p>PRICE ONE PENNY.<p>Copies can always be had at [  ] London Street, Glasgow.<p>Air.-Original.<br>'Twas at the Brighton station,<br>In pursuit of my vocation,<br>I saw a tall and handsome girl<br>Behind the railway bar;<br>I heard some one call her Jessie<br>Perhaps 'twas Mister Pond, the lessee,<br>And her diamond eyes were twinkling<br>Just like the evening star.<br>I found this pretty dame<br>Made love to all that came,<br>In a quiet sort of way,<br>With her eyes so soft and bright;<br>she had lovers half-a-score, <br>Always some one to adore,<br>From the first train in the morning,<br>Till the last train out at night.<p>Spoken.? Yes, her admirers were?<p>CHORUS :<br>A tinker and a tailor, and a soldier and a sailor,<br>And a swell that used to talk about his pa and his ma?<br>A butcher and a baker, and a quiet-looking Quaker,<br>All courted pretty Jessie at the railway bar.<br>Now this darling little creature,<br>With a smile on every feature,<br>Was serving all the customers<br>With wine and bitter beer;<br>And this was on a Monday,<br>So I asked her if, on Sunday,<br>She would meet me in the Green Park,<br>When she gave me such a leer.<br>And then she said to me,<br>" Most happy I should be,<br>But  I'm sorry to inform you<br>That it's not my Sunday out.<br>One Sunday out of nine<br>Is the only one that's mine,"<br>And then she had to leave me<br>Just to serve a glass of stout.<p>Spoken?Yes, but she never informed me that she had on<br>previous Sundays walked out with?CHORUS.<br>Well, better late than never,<br>And I thought that I was clever,<br>To get Jessie, dear, to meet me<br>When it was her Sunday out;<br>With my hair curled and anointed,<br>At the time and place appointed,<br>I was there to the minute,<br>And began to look about.<br>And when my Jessie came<br>My heart was in a flame.<br>When I saw her waterfall,<br>And her bonnet trimmed so gay;<br>She politely took my arm-<br>I admired her every charm,<br>But judge of my surprise<br>When I heard some urchins say?<p>Spoken. -I say, Bill, if there ain't Jessie along wi' another<br>chap; why, I've seen her with?CHORUS.<p>Now, my confidence was shaken<br>But I thought the boys mistaken,<br>And my modesty would not permit<br>To ask if it was true.<br>I proposed and she accepted,<br>In a manner unaffected, <br>The tears she shed completely hid<br>From me her eyes so blue.<br>Then I sent her a wedding dress.<br>Fit for an Empress,<br>And saw the porter give it her<br>While serving at the bar;<br>But on our wedding day<br>Miss Jessie ran away,<br>And got married to a man that sold<br>The Standard and the Star.<p>Spoken.?Yes, and the only consolation I had was, she<br>had taken in, besides myself,?CHORUS,<p>Saturday, April 26,1884,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  P.D.-4.4.74.</p>
