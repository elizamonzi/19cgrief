	<p> THE STORM OH THE PAISLEY CANAL.<p>PRICE ONE PENNY.<p>Copies can always be had at the Poet's Box, 190 and 192 Overgate, Dundee,<p>Tune?Original,<p>Pray look on this victim of Cupid,<br>Tae my tale of woe give an ear,<br>As sure as death I'm knocked quite stupid,<br>I'll gang wrang in the head tae, I fear,<br>An' it's a' through a lass that I gaed wi',<br>Ay, Mary M'Phail was her name;<br>My affections she hag cruelly played wf',<br>And left me like a wandered wean.<p>Spoken.?Aye, mony a time I hae laughed<br>at the idea o' folk gaeu wrang m the head an'<br>committin' suicide through love, but there's nae.<br>body kens the impression it leaves when vour<br>lass leaves you. I ken mony a time I hae fun'<br>mysol' daunering owre by Jamaica Brlg wi' the<br>full intention o' throwin' mysel' owre, but on<br>second consideration when I thoucht on the<br>trouble it would gie it her fouk, fairly spile my<br>claes, au' maybe catch cauld, I thoucht it would<br>be as weel tae nevor mind. Aye, Mary M'Phail<br>hasna failed tae mak' me fail plenty.<p>CHORUS.<p>I wish that I never had seen her,<br>She has cruelly caused my doonfa'<br>She's awa' wi' the mate o' a steamer<br>That sailed on the Paisley Canal<p>Ye mann ken that her parents resided<br>In that famous place Paisley toon,<br>Tae first-fit them we baith had deeided<br>When Hogmanay nicht would come roUn'.<br>She said wl' the train she was tired,<br>And would like tae gang doon by the sea,<br>So a berth for us baith I then hired<br>In the Crossmyloof steamshib "Bumbee."<p>Spoken?Ay, freens, I spared nae expense<br>tae mak' her comfortable, I took a cabin pas-<br>sage in that latge and commodious steamship<br>O' twa hunder punds bur hen, the "Bumbec,'t<br>o' Crossmyloof. And before st arting that nich<br>I boeht a bottle a' the hard stuff. nane o' the<br>"Weekly Mail" kind, mind ye, but the rale Glen-<br>tak'it, some curran' scones, same potted head,<br>Some wulks, and several ither luxuries. I took<br>ane last look o' the shore o' Glesca', a carter<br>gied us a shove aff, and awa' we started, but I<br>micht hae kent there wis something gaun tae<br>tab' place, for before we left the Quay there<br>wis a punt lying oppeslte tae us wi' a lot o'<br>man-o-war sailors, on board, and they aye kept<br>winking at Mary, and she seemed  ltk e it.<p>When passing the Shaws a great storm<br>Wi terrible fury cam on<br>got my Sunday troosers r torn<br>And Mary she lost her chignon.<br>I thocht I wad faint wi alarm,<br>When, A hauns on deck, the Captain roared,<br>And the erew was a chap wl yae arm,<br>He says, Throw the main deck overboard.<p>We hadno gaen far up the channel<br>When we felt such a thunderin shock,<br>The Captain gaed aft wi a candle,<br>And found out we had struck on a fock,<br>I lost Mary amfdst a' the commotion.<br>On a flour barrel I sprang aeross,<br>And by chance was rescnodf rom the ocean,<br>By a passing punt loaded with dross.<p>Spoken, ?There was a nice predicament tao<br>be in Talk aboot first-flttinn, I wis bobbin<br>aboot for three or four hours on the briny ocean<br>whustlin wi my fingers in my mooth as a signal<br>o' distress, but at last ane o' Drummonds Gov-<br>ernment screws cam in sicht, but they either<br>took me for a buoy, or else the spirit o the storm<br>and were frichted to tak me on board, but at<br>last they got convinced I was a human beieg,<br>so they hove to, and before you could count,<br>three I was on board and related my sad tale<br>tae the Captain. But I think a the Captains<br>Ere tarred wi the same stick, for he jist gied<br>bis troosers a hitch up an he says. Avast,<br>you landlubber, the girl will be right enough.<br>She micht be richt enough for them she was<br>wi but no for me; but however I arrived back<br>frae whaur I started, a sadder but a wiser man<br>I met a the ither fouk gaun hame quite hapyy<br>singing the Days o Auld Lang Syne, and<br>Let us be happy together, but I had tae gang<br>hame singing in tae mysel.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I wich that I never had seen her, etc.<p>I had jist been twa days hauie tae a letter<br>Cam frae Mary that did mak me stare.<br>She said I should try and forget her<br>For she couldna see me ony mair<br>She got spliced the day after the storm<br>Tae the Captain for saving her life,<br>So noo I'm left quite forlorn,<br>Daunerin aboot lookiu oot for a wife.<p>Spoken.?Aye. the day I got that letter I<br>kent at auce it was frae Mtry, I could aye tell<br>her han write, ye wad chink it was wrote wi<br>the end o a potstick. It commenced wi, Dear<br>Bauldie (aye she was dear enough tae me ony<br>way, for the excursion cost me ane an fivepence,<br>my hail years gatherin, no speakin o three<br>penc hapenny I spent wi her up at the shows<br>during the fair time), she says Dear Bauldie,<br>I hope youll no tak it amiss o me marryin the<br>Captain o During the /ill/nbee, for what is to be<br>will be. D/ill/&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the tempest me an the mate<br>got haud o an egg box an clung tae it tae we<br>were picked up by a large troopship o ane<br>horse-power and carried back tae the fore/ill/<br>port o Strabungo. When, without only<br>hesitation, he asked me if I would be his<br>partner for life, so I just said aye. because him<br>saving my life I thoucht he had the richt tae<br>get me; so when the clergyman asked mo if I<br>would tak him for better or worse, I said I<br>would tak him for the better the warst o't<br>bein disappointin you, but it eanna be helped<br>noo. Im appointed stewardess on board ane<br>o the carnal liners, so as there is to be a soiree<br>on board the nicht, an I hae tae attend a a party<br>o coalheavers. for the present I'll bid you an<br>everlasting fareweel, At the fit o the letter<br>there was a P.S. (I suppose that meant puir<br>Sowl), it said, If you came tae Strabunge<br>on Monday next I could get ye a job as pilot<br>tae pull up ane o the canal ironclads frae;<br>Paisley every morning. But I would prefer<br>bein at my ain trade weavin at hame, an.<br>content mysel singin?<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I wish that I never had seen her, etc'</p>
