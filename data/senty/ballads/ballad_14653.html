	<p> EXTRAORDINARY<br>PREDICTIONS!!<p>A Full and Particular Account of the most astonishing PROPHECIES and PRE-<br>DICTIONS, concerning the Revolutions, War, Reform, &c that is said will<br>happen in the various Nations of Europe, &c, in the different Months of<br>this eventful year, 1831. By a celebrated Jewish Prophet, from Poland.<p>JANUARY....When I consider the aspects that usher in the new-born year, I<br>must say, the times appears fraught with ominous denouncements! Important<br>changes are foretold to mighty states ? remarkable events occur to Russia, Den-<br>mark, Sweden, and an Oriental Kingdom. London is the scene of extraordinary<br>political and mercurial schemes.<p>FEBRUARY.....This is an unfortunate month. Illness or a singular trouble, is<br>approaching to an illustrious person, perhaps mighty personage. His horoscope<br>has certainly a malicious aspect therein, and which will scarcely pass without a<br>noted effect either in this or the ensuing month. One in military life, or an emi-<br>nent man dies or is disgraced ; a clergyman suffers ; there is a great calamity to<br>some part of the religious world ; a conspiracy ; many knavish schemes, thefts,<br>robberies, &c. ; and something extraordinary excites the popular attentions.<p>MARCH...The nativity of a great personage is still afflicted. We may expect a<br>military death or funeral ; the decease of a very clever character ; a great fire; a<br>notorious robbery, (perhaps murder); many heavy failures in trade ; a shipwreck;<br>many shameful contentions ; a remarkable or pompous nuptial; and such evil<br>news both at home and from abroad, where I think a great battle is likely to be<br>fought. Moreover, it will be a. month of mortality ; a great gambler dies, or is<br>ruined, and many pompous preparations are in progress. A shameful project or<br>nefarious scheme is discovered or exploded ; a noted person rediculed ; and the<br>month is evil for the rising generation, while in literature and science there will<br>be singular failures.<p>APRIL....This is a month of misfortunes to London, and, perhaps, also to Eng-<br>land ; but something of high consequence, and I think also fortunate to the com-<br>munity, will happen very shortly. A dignified personage is, however, still doom-<br>ed to illness or trouble; and there will be conflagrations, as also extraordinary<br>news, great part of a mischievous nature.<p>MAY....I fear this will be a month of disasters. Evil reports, lies, and rumours<br>...several fires and sudden deaths, or violent catastrophes. One of an illustrious<br>family is troubled or afflicted ; something remarkable may happen to a Princess,<br>or a noble Lady ; a great man dies, and there is evil news from foreign parts,<br>It is also a month of singular mortality, especially to persons signified by Sol,<br>viz. these in authority, dignified and wealthy.<p>JUNE....The Continental States, perhaps Holland or the Netherlands are indi-<br>cated by no favourable omens. A great poet or painter dies. In an illustrious<br>family there are still directions of trouble, or something still worse. The signifi-<br>cator of America. In the monthly horoscope, forebodes a preparation for war, or<br>that country changes in its policy, if not legislators. Death also claims his share<br>in the councils of a certain nation, and it will be a wonder if he do not come off<br>victorious. Scientific men or statesmen, however, are promoted. The funeral of<br>an eminent clergyman is at hand.<p>JULY.....We may expect a great statesman or scientific character to meet death<br>or disgrace. The military in general are under evil aspects ; faiiures in the com-<br>mercial world ; fires and crimes of no usual order, and more especially abroad.<br>It is an evil month for poets, painters, musicians, &c. A noted gambler or specu-<br>lator suffers; and America, France, and several foreign parts, are amenable to<br>mischievous influences, maladies, &c.<p>AUGUST....The admonitions of the starry heavens, however, they may be light-<br>ly esteemed or disregarded by mankind, ate, during this thrice eventful epoch,<br>loud in their ominus and fearful forewarnings. Let us fervently hope the warn-<br>ing thus given may not be in vain !  Mere are signs of mortality to the noble?<br>ilness to a great or princely personage ? death of a clergyman or learned person<br>?detection of an impostor, and many other primary catastrophes, many of which,<br>scorning the limits of time, will be continued beyond the month.<p>SEPTEMBER....This is assuredly a busy eventful month, not in popular annals.<br>A philanthropic scheme is began or premeditated.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The clergy seems fortunate ;<br>and abroad some extraordinary matters are consummating. A great man becomes<br>popular during this configuration.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I would that the good were lasting ! but alas,<br>cannot so promise it.<p>OCTOBER....This will indeed be a noted month, for wedlock and nuptial cere-<br>monies. One or more of these too, bedecked with pageantry of state, or splend-<br>our of wealth; many widows, and middle aged of the fair sex, will have good<br>cause to think of October 1831. The other events of the month are no less ex-<br>traordinary.<p>NOVEMBER....The Sun quartiles Herschel. Woe to the great one. The Sun<br>squares Jupiter ! Woe to one of the church. These are the oracles of the month-<br>ly horoscope. Death is preparing his phantom dart?soon will he strike. Ye<br>who oppress the poor and needy?who are even as the outcasts of the earth in<br>the eyes of Heaven?take warning. Lo ! the time is at hand.<p>DECEMBER....December concludes the forewarnings of the year, and in this<br>gloomy month we find Mercury gives us a passing touch of calamities, fires, &c.<br>well had it have been had the year ended with happier influences ; and well<br>will it still be, if mankind take timely warning from the past......(R. M. Printer.)<p></p>
