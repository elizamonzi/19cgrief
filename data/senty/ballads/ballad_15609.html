	<p> The last Speech and Confession,<p>And last Words of Thomas Neilson, who was Executed at Maybol, on Tbur-<br>sday being the 14th of August, 1718. For Murdering one Named<br>M'Connel, in the Parish of  Girvan.<p>FOR the better Understanding of the ensuing Discourse, it will hot be amise to Re-<br>late how this matter began. The Murdered, and the. Murderers, dwelt in a<br>Mealing together, in Daldouy in the Parish of Girvan, and were every way Partiners<br>( but the Neilson's besides were Cowpers to their Employment) It's Storied that the<br>Man Murdered was a Rubust stormy fort of a Man, and able for both the Father and<br>the Son, and had many Squables in former times, for the matter of four Years space ;<br>and probably the Father and Son being worsted, they only lacked an Opportunity, Ac-<br>cordingly they sharpned their Spades at a Smiths Booth very nicely and made them as<br>sharp as Knives, which amuzed the Smith not a little. Then this M'connel the Man<br>Murdered, going to cast Pits in the Moss ; this Neilson and,his Son came to him and<br>desired him to put up the part of his Faldicke conjunct  with them,otherwise he must<br>Pay what skaith they should afterwards incurr. This M'connel came in to his Wife,<br>aad told her she said she was very willing, but she Was afraid they had some bad<br>design on him, where at he replyed the People were not Mad, and so went along<br>with them ; where they came upon the Spot, they agreed among themselves that the<br>Man Murdered should lift the Turf first, so as he Was lifting of the Turf, the Father<br>with his Spade whipt down the side of his Head, and broke the small of his Back,and<br>Legs and Arm's, he received 30 several Wounds from them, after which they departed;<br>and as they were coming Home, M'connels Wife met them, and enquired for her<br>Husband,'they told her he was lying yonder, GOD let him never Rise; the poor<br>Woman said very soberly, its a bad Prayer, and it's what I feared, and told my Dear<br>in the morning. Yet GOD spared him a little to speak to her, fays Ire the Cowpers<br>have gain' the Day, and GOD have Mercy upon my Soul, and that was all he said,<br>When the Father and Son went Home, the Son Fled, and the Father went to Prayer,<br>and accordingly about an Hour thereafter the Neighbourhood rose & apprehended him<br>The Poor Woman in the mean while was fitting with the Corps in her Arms, for a large<br>half Hour before any came to her.<p>When this Man was Murdered there was people at a distance, but none so near<br>hand as Could lake up this Debate, however tho' the Murder could not be proven by<br>Witnesses, it was proven by Circumstances, for in the first place they were all three<br>seen to go out together, and all three at Work tho at distance together, and then Two<br>were seen to, come away, and one left.<p>Lastly these Neilsons Spades were seen to be full of Blood, and which is strange it's<br>said, that Rub as you will, none can either rub or wash off that Blood, but kill it grew<br>the brighter.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  .&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <p>Two Nights before he was Executed, they Examined him upon the Guard,if he did<br>it throw Envy, he said that it was not so much throw Envy, as he was compelled to<br>it, for when this Man [quoth he  took his Mad fits he was oblidged many times<br>to leave the place and run for it.<p>After he was brought forth to the place of Execution betwixt Two and Three a-<br>clock, he was waited on by the very Revernd, the Ministers of Maybol, Carmichl,<br>Straiton, Kirkoswal, and his own Minister the Minister of Girvan, Prayers said, Psalms<br>sung; he was desired by the Ministers, now to give Satisfaction to the People of GOD<br>that were there present, whereat he kneeled down and Prayed,that the Almighty might<br>Pardon that Hainous Act of Murder There the Ministers asked several. Questions as<br>whether of not he Murdered thro' Envy He keep silent, for tho he Gofessed it in<br>Prison, he did not upon the Scaffold : Also with several other Questions, whether or<br>not he had Converse with the Devil as was reported of him, he returned no positive<br>Answer. but entertained them with a Discourse that he was neither a Sabbath breaker<br>nor a Drunkard more than others, which was no Answer at all to the Question, where<br>at one of the Ministers said, Tbomas, I have done with you. So that save<br>the Murdering of the Man he made no furder Consession. Then he was at last<br>thrown over the Ladder with great Difficulty; for he was loath to Die.</p>
