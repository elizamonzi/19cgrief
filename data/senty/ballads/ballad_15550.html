	<p> Execution,<p>Second Edition.<p>A full and particular account of the Execution of WILLIAM<br>ADAMS, slater, who was this day, Wednesday the 6th January<br>1830, Executed at the head of Libberton Wynd, Lawnmarket,<br>for assaulting and robbing Michael Pirnie, mason, on the even_<br>ing of the 5th September last, of one pound, four shillings, and<br>eightpence, and a tin snuff-box ; with his Last Dying Speech on<br>the Scaffold.<p>EDINBURGH, 6th January  1830.?This tnfortunate  young<br>man suffered the last penalty of the law, at the head of Lib-<br>erton Wynd, this day, for Asault and Robbery, on the 5th Sep-<br>tember last, pursuant to his sentence before the High Court of<br>Justicary, on the 30th of November last.<p>It will be recollecetd, that this young man was tried here on the<br>30th November last, for assaulting and robbing Michael Pirnie,<br>mason, on the 5th of September preceding, whom he met in the<br>Pleasance, and followed through various places to the Vennel in the<br>Cowgate, where he said he had a coat to sell at his grandmother's,<br>because he had enlisted. When going up the stair, he knocked<br>down Pirnie, and robbed him of a pound note, some silver, and a<br>snuff-box. The Jury, after a very few minutes consultation, un-<br>animously found the panel guilty, but recommended him to mercy,<br>on account of his youth, and on the supposition of his having a<br>wife and family.<p>The Lord Justice Clerk, in passing sentence, stated, that from<br>the way and manner the crime was commited, committed in the<br>very centre of the city, it was absolutely necessary for the public<br>safety that an example should be made. In such a case it would<br>have been impossible for the Lord Advocate to have interponed his<br>authority, and, therefore, his Lordship had acted properly in allow-<br>ing the consequence of the verdict to rest with is Majesty' s ad-<br>visers. His Lordship strongly cautioned the pannel against in-<br>dulging in the hope of a commutaion of his sentence, for seldom<br>or ever had the punishment for acts of robbery, when accompanied<br>by violence, been mitigated.<p>His Lordship then sentenced Adams to be executed at the<br>Head of Libberton Wynd, between the hoars of Eight and Ten,<br>forenoon, on Wednesday the 6th day of January next.<p>His conduct since his condemnation was very becoming his<br>awful situation, and he was constantly attended by the Reverend<br>Doctor Gordon, and the Reverend Mr Porteous, chaplain of the<br>Jail, who used every endeavour to direct his solicitations and pray-<br>ers to the throne of grace for mercy. He was likewise waited<br>upon by several other well-disposed persons and friends, to whose<br>kindly exhortations and supplications he seemed to pay great<br>deference and attention. From his being a native of Edinburgh a<br>considerable degree of interest was excited in his favour. He<br>usually lived with his grandmother, and was generally called by<br>her name?Reid.<p>Yesterday he  was conveyed  over to the Lock-up-House about<p>Seven o'clock, where he slept for a few hours very composedly.....<p>Early in the morning he arose, and was soon waited on by Dr<br>Gordon and Mr Porteous. A short time before eight Bailies An-<br>derson and Morton entered, when the prisoner's arms were pi-<br>nioned, and the whole then proceeded, in solemn procession, up<br>the Wynd to the Scaffold. After a psalm was again sung, and a<br>most impressive and earnest prayer offered up for him, he came<br>forward to the front of the Scaffold, and addressed the spectators in<br>the following words :....' I am a young man brought to an untimely<br>fate by my crimes. I trust all who witness my situation will take<br>take warning, and flee from those crimes which have proved<br>my ruin....that they will pray to God for their awn souls?read<br>the Bible, and keep the Sabbath....and may God be ever with you<br>alll'.... After which, he mounted the fatal drop, where he continued<br>praying for a few minutes. He then dropped the signal, and<br>was instantly launched into eterninty.<p>Price One Penny.</p>
