	<p> Trial and Sentence. <p>A Full and Particular Account of the Trial and Sen<br>tence&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of ROBERT&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SURRAGE,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and  JOHN<p>DEMPSEY, Privates in the 13th Regiment of In-<br>fantry, who are to be Executed at Edinburgh, on<br>Wednesday the 13th December, 1820, for the Mur-<br>der  of Three Men in a Riot at  Greenock, on the<br> Evening of the 31 st of July last.<p>AT Edinburgh, on Tuesday the 7th September 1820, came on,<br>before the High Court of Justiciary, the trials of Robert<br>Surrege, John Dempsey, John Beck, Joseph Elliot, Malachi Clinton,<br>and Patrick Lynch, all privates in the 13th regiment of foot, for<br>the murder of Robert Simpson, Henry Pearson, and Archibald<br>Morrison, at Greenock, on the 31st July last. After the indictmen<br>was read, and the pannels had pled Not Guilty, Mr Menzies stated,<br>that, as the prisoners had suffered considerably from the animad-<br>versions of the public print; and as they laboured under other<br>disadvantages as strangers, not knowing any witnesses, nor so si-<br>tuated as to expect any to volunteer in their behalf, he was anxious<br>that Malachi Clinton, against whom nothing could be proved, might<br>be put to trial first, in order that, after his acquittal, he might ap-<br>pear as a witness in favour of the others. To which the Lord Ad-<br>vocate consented, as his information did not justify him in detain-<br>ing the Court with his trial, and he was accordingly acquitted.<p>Several witnesses, on the part of the prosecution, were then ex-<br>amined, one of whom, Mitchell, remembers hearing a noise in the<br>Highland Close, opposite Shannon's Close, in the summer, about<br>midnight. When he went up, he saw one of several soldiers, a tall<br>man, asking the best of the blue jackets to turn out, and he would<br>fight them. There were five or six soldiers, and about a dozen<br>sailors and tradesmen. Afterwards one of the soldiers, a little<br>man, came up with a bayonet under his jacket, and asked them to<br>turn out and fight. He did not hear the sailors cry any thing;<br>they .wanted to make peace. A sailor came up, and offered the sol-<br>diers half a pint not to wrangle. One of the soldiers took hold of<br>a stoup the sailor had, and said, " Come away, shipmate." The<br>soldier went alongside of him, and all the rest followed ; witness<br>remained at the head of the close, and shortly after he heard a noise,<br>and one of the soldiers knock down a sailor with a stoup. The<br>sailor rose up and followed the soldier into a laigh house; the door<br>was immediately shut, and people, as if from the inside, called out<br>they were killing the lad; does not know the Lad. The crowd<br>then began to break open the doors and window-shutters; saw no<br>soldiers at this time ; witness ran up the close ; he stood a little,<br>and then heard one of the soldiers cry " Fire!" and heard the crowd<br>say that a lad fell.?Then follow the evidence of several other wit-<br>nesses, nearly in the same terms. After which commenced the<br>exculpatory proof, the first of whom was Malachi Clinton.<p>Mrs Cochrane bore testimony to the character of the prisoners,<br>as sober, decent, and quiet men. About 11 or 12 o'clock four of<br>the soldiers came, and she thinks Dempsey cried to open the door<br>for God's sake, or they would be murdered. When they get in<br>they rushed up stairs, and Dempsey was covered with blood. There<br>was swearing and blaspheming among the mob on the outside, who<br>broke her window shutters, and swore they would have the bloody<br>souls of the soldiers in a few moments. This was before the firing,<br>and the mob would have got in, but for the firing. Captain Shear<br>man swore that the soldiers came instantly down upon his saying<br>he would protect them from the mob, and surrendered their mus-<br>kets. They were very much disfigured, and appeared to be in<p>drink------Mrs Boyd remembers seeing the town's people chacing<p>the soldiers into Cochrane's house, breaking the windows, and forc-<br>ing the door with stones or sticks. Saw and heard some firing from<br>the high window, but a voice called out, " take care," before the<p>shots.------Sir W. Williams, Leiut.-col. of 13th, swore Surrage was<p>always an excellent sober man, and much regarded by his captain.<br>Dempsey, though fond of drink a little, was never known as cruel,<br>and that the other prisoners had good characters. The Lord Advo-<br>cate then addressed the jury on the part of the Crown, when<p>Mr Menzies, for the pannels, made an able and ingenious de-<br>fence'; after which, the Lord Justice Clerk summed up the evidence,<br>and the Jury returned a viva voce verdict, finding Beck Not Guilty<br>the indictment against Elliot and Linch, Not Proven, and Surrage<br>and Dempsey, Guilty of the Murder of Simpson and Pearson only<br>but unanimously recommended Surrage to mercy.<p>Wednesday, 12 o'clock?Robert Surrage and John Dempsey,<br>were sentenced to be Executed in Edinburgh on Wednesday the 13th<br>December next, between 8 and 10 o'clock in the morning.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They<br>Appeared deeply affected.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Their Trial lasted nineteen hours.<br>Edinburgh, Printed for James Lindsay:?PRICE ONE PENNY.</p>
