	<p> Particulars of the Life, Trial, Character, and Behaviour of<p>MARGARET DICKSON,<p>AGED 22,<p>Who was executed at Edinburgh, on Monday, Feb. 1, 1813,<br>For the MURDER of her Bastard Child.<p>MARGARET DICKSON was born at Mugsleburgh,<br>about five miles from Edinburgh, and brought up by<br>parents in a strict attendance on the worship of God, and<br>taught early the duties of that station, in which was most<br>probable Providence would place her, namely, a labori-<br>ous one.<p>It is necessary to observe, that the people in the town,<br>where she lived, are either fishermen, gardeners, or those<br>who are employed in making salt; and as Edinburgh is<br>supplied with those articles from that place, most of the<br>mens wives are employed to get their living, by carrying<br>the different articles thither, which they cry about the<br>streets.<p>When Margaret Dickson grew up, she was married<br>to a fisherman, but there being a demand for seamen he was<br>impressed on board one of the ships of war.<p>During the time he was abroad, she became acquainted<br>with a man in the same neighbourhood, who seduced her,<br>and the consequence was, that she became with child, in<br>Scotland every woman who was guilty of fornication, was<br>obliged to sit on a seat in the most conspicuous place<br>in the church, three different Sundays, when she received<br>a public rebuke from the minister, and so much were the<br>women intimidated at the disgrace, that many of them de-<br>stroyed the fruits of their amours, rather than be made a<br>spectacle to all the inhabitants of a parish ; for nothing was<br>more common than for these, who would not come to church<br>to hear a a sermon in seven years, would go to hear the shame<br>of one of her own sex.<p>Margaret Dickson was accused by some of her neigh-<br>bours with being pregnant, but the fear of shame induced<br>her to deny it, although the symptoms were very plain.<p>As the time of her delivery drew near, she endeavoured<br>to conceal it the more, and at last the child was born, but<br>whether alive or not, cannot be certainly known ; only<br>that she was apprehended on suspicion, and committed to<br>Edinburgh Gaol. The surgeon, who examined the body<br>of the child, made the usual experiments, by putting the<br>lungs into water, but according to the opinion of some<br>eminent physicians, that experiment is not always to be<br>depended upon, it is impossible for men to know every thing;<br>and it often happens, that gentlemen, who have made the law<br>their study, and obtained seats on the bench, are obliged,<br>in taking evidence, to abide by the opinion of a surgeon.<br>Indeed, where cases are plain, such as a wound with a<br>weapon, that must of course prove mortal, no doubt can<br>remain ; but then, when the life of a person depends upon<br>the opinion of two or three surgeons concerning a disputed<br>point, we think that both the court and the jury ought<br>to lean to mercy. In the course of the evidence produced<br>against Margaret Dickson, it appeared from the depositions<br>of several witnesses, that she had been apparently pregnant,<br>although she continued to deny it. It also appeared,<br>that a child was found dead near the place where she lived,<br>and there were to be seen about her all the appearances of<br>a delivery.<p>The surgeon deposed, that when the lungs of the child<br>were put into water they swimmed, so that it was their<br>opinion that it had breathed ; for as they said, unless a child<br>has breathed, so as air could be drawn into the lungs those<br>parts of the body will not swim. Upon the whole the evi-<br>dence was believed by the jury, who found her guilty, and<br>she received sentence of death.<p>While she lay in confinement she was extremely penitent,<br>and acknowledged that she had in many instances, neglected<br>her duty, and likewise that she had been guilty of fornica-<br>tion ; but to the last denied murdering the child, or that she<br>had the least intention of so doing. Her reason for conceal-<br>ing the birth of the child was for fear of being made a public<br>example in the church, and a laughing-stock to all her neigh-<br>bours. She said she was suddenly taken in labour, sooner<br>than she expected, and her agonies not only prevented her<br>from getting assistance, but also left her in a state of insen-<br>sibility, so that what became of her child she could not say.<p>When she was brought to the gallows she behaved in the<br>most penitent manner, but still denied her guilt, after which<br>she was turned off, and hung the usual time.<p>When cut down her body was given to her friends, who<br>put her into a coffin, in order to carry it to Musselburgh, for<br>interment; but the men who had charge of the corpse stop-<br>ped at a village, called Pepper Mill, about two miles from<br>Edinburgh, in order to get some refreshment, leaving the<br>cart with the body near the door. While they were drinking<br>one of the men thought he saw the lid of the coffin move, and<br>going towards the cart, uncovered it, when he could per-<br>ceive the woman to move, and she arose upright in her coffin;<br>upon which he and others took to their heels, almost killed<br>with fear. A gardener who was drinking in the house went<br>up to the coffin, and had the presence of mind to open a<br>vein, and within an hour afterwards she was so well recovered<br>as to be able to go to bed. Next morning she walked home<br>to Mussleburgh. It is necessary to observe that much of the<br>Scottish law is built on Roman Pandects, and according to<br>them every person upon whom the judgment of the court has<br>been executed, has no more to suffer, but must be for ever<br>discharged. Another maxim in the same institution is, that<br>the executed person is dead law, so that the marriage is dis-<br>solved. This was the case with M. Dickson, for the King's<br>advocate could not pursue her any further, but filed a bill in<br>the High Court of Justicary against the Sheriff, for not seeing<br>the judgment executed, and her husband being a good-natured<br>man, was married to her a few days after. She still conti-<br>nued to deny that she had committed the crime. From her<br>example, and the uncertainly of her guilt, it is to be hoped<br>that juries will be cautious how they find a verdict where the<br>case may appear doubtful.<p>This remarkable affair happened at Edinburgh.<br>Wilkins, Printer, Derby.</p>
