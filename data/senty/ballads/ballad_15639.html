	<p> The St.  James's surprizing and afrightful<p>APPARITION<p>Being a fearful and terrible Account of a wonderful Vision that appeared at St.<br>James's Pork, near St. James's House on Saturday Night, being the 13th of<br>January 1722. Which Surprized all tie Centinels, of four Men without Heads,<br>bearing a Coffin with four Wheels upon their shoulders, and another headless<br>Person riding on Horseback before the Coffla, which so terrified the Centinel that<br>first saw it that be fell to the Ground in a swoon, whilst  the Apparition marched<br>towards the late Duke of Buckingham's House. The Truth of this is attested by<br>several Centinels who perceived the said Apparition.<p>WHatever the World may think of Apparitions and Spectres, 'tis very certain,<br>such has been before, and learned Divines still own the fame Exist, and  ave<br>appeared in the several past Ages. There are so many things upon Record of this<br>Nature, that it would be numberless to Name them; and if Signs and Tokens<br>from Heaven seem to fortell certain accidents to Kingdoms and Nations, I see no<br>Reason why the Divine Power may not make use of the Ministry of Spirits to<br>indigitate some extraordinarly Events that may happen; or why be might not<br>raise Forms or Ideas to the Understandings, as the Spirits had existingly appear-<br>ed, either to punish the Guilty, or to manifest his Will; add this he can do to what<br>Persons he pleases, as the Gift of Tongues was given by a supernatural Power to the<p>Apostles. But leaving the solution of these Difficulties to Wiser-Heads, I proceed<br>to instance a late Circumstance that seems to be very strange and surprizing, and<br>leave it to my Reader to make what suitable marks upon it as they shall think fit.<p>While a profound silence and deep sleep had seized the Country, Town and <br>Court, on saturday Night about the hours of twelve and one, as a poor Centinel<br>was upon his Duty there passed by him a surprizing Apparition that struck him<br>with an unspeakable terror; but soon resuming his military Courage, he looked<br>more curiously at them, and asked, Who they were? But no Voice answering neither<br>hearing any Noice of their Feet, as might be expected in such an universal silence,<br>he ventur'd to draw nearer, and then he was confound'd indeed! There appeared<br>no less to him than a solemn, mournful and yet a very odd spectacie as tho' the<br>whole society of unhappy Criminals that were beheaded had appointed to meet in a<br>strange Cavalcade, at the Funeral of one of their Brethren. First appeared a Man<br>I should have said part of a Man on Horseback, in very lately Trappings, with a<br>Wand in his Hand, but without a Head ; next appeared a Coffin with sour wheels,<br>like those resembling the Chariot Wheels of the Heathen God's, and this Coffin was<br>bore upon the shoulders of four Bodies withont heads, and behind followed two<br>Men with lighted torches in their hands, without heads too, the Light of which<br>torches made it more obvious to the amazed spectators; and on the Coffin lay a<br>Knife, as tho' that was the Instrument whereby the Deceas'd lost his Life.<p>You may imagine the surprize of the poor Centinel on this account, at his<br>approach they seem'd to lay the Coffin on the Ground before him, but he immedi-<br>-ately fell down in a swoon, which occasion'd them to march forward towards the<br>Duke of Buckingham's House, where they were likewise perceived by the Centinel<br>at the Park-gate;soon afterwards the Guards coming to relieve the Centries,found the<br>first Centinel at some Distance from his Post in the rnost violent agitations ; but<br>after recovering himself, he related the Matter as it is here mentioned, which is also<br>coafirm'd by Others who perceived it likewise.<p>What ever such an appearance may pretend, we cannot, we dare not say ; not<br>is it reasonable to conclude what only is left to Time and Providence.But certainly<br>if any thing is intended or meant, either by real apparitions, or artful Delusions, 'tis<br>hoped a due Repentance will avert Divine Wrath as to the Former, like the penitent<br>Ninevites; and if such an appearance has been contrived by Men, may their wicked<br>Designs be frustrated, that seems to unhinge our present happy Constitution in<br>Church and State, destroy our Liberties, and is contriv'd as a Reproach against the<br>supernatural Power of the Almighty.</p>
