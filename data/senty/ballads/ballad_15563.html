	<p> M U R D E R.<p>Full, True, and Particular Account of that most<br>Horrid Murder which was committed on New<br>year's Morning, in Dunbar Street. Canal Basin<br>Edinburgh, on the body of Mrs Calderhead<br>with a correct account of the apprehension of<br>the Murderers ; with an account of that awful<br>accident that happened on Saturday Morning,<br>in Milne's Court, Lawnmarket, when a woman<br>was burned to death.<p>Saturday being New Year's Day, it was usher-<br>ed in with all those scenes of mirth and jollity us-<br>ual upon such occasions in Scotland. But a time<br>of this kind rarely passes over, without some extra-<br>ordinary incident occurring to mar the happiness<br>and peace of some individual or family.<p>It is our painful duty to record an instance of<br>the fatal effects of people going from house to<br>house on New Year's Morning, when they ought<br>to have remained at home, and made themselves<br>happy with their family, and thereby shewing a<br>good example to the rising generation.<p>Murder is a crime of the greatest magnitude,<br>the bare recital of which, at all times, fills the mind<br>with horror. The circumstances attending the<br>commission of this Murder are of the most revolt-<br>ing description.<p>About four o'clock on New Year's Morning, a<br>most horrid and diabolical murder was perpetrated<br>in a house in Dunbar Street, near the Canal Basin,<p>Edinburgh__Mrs Calderhead, wife of Alexander<p>Calderhead, both of whom gained an honest livli-<br>by retailing potatoes through this town, and who<br>bore a very respectable character, entered a com-<br>pany in good health and high spirits, and was car-<br>ried out a. corpse. Two men, brothers, are in cus-<br>tody, on suspicion of being the Murderers. The<br>forehead of the unfortunate woman was cut and<br>bruised, and in the abdomen, from the lower part<br>upwards, there Was a wound through an extent of<br>about ten inches. Delicacy forbids us to be more<br>explicit. The unfortunate woman has left a fa-<br>mily of five children to deplore her untimely end.<br>The case is under investigation.<p>A WOMAN BURNED TO DEATH, ON<br>NEW YEAR'S MORNING.<p>On Saturday Morning an old woman in Milne's<br>Court, Lawnmarket, was found in her house, liter-<br>ally burned to a cinder. How the melancholy<br>event took place is uncertain ; but the remains of<br>her body were discovered about 8 o'clock, on Sa-<br>turday morning, by some individual who had call<br>ed to see her.<p>John Campbell, Printer, Edinburgh.<p>SECOND EDITION OF THE<p><p>DREADFUL<p>MURDER<p><p><br>AWFUL BEGINNING OF THE NEW YEAR.<p>A full,true, and particular Account of the most Horrid and Barbar-<p>Murder of&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mrs Calderhead,  wife.of&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alexander  Calderhead,<p>Potato  Dealer,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dunbar Street,  in  Fountainbridge,  near the Canal<p>Basin, in the common stair leading to her house,  between three and<p>four o'clock this morning, while she was engaged in innocently wel-<p>coming in the New Year :And also of the apprehension of two young.<p>men, brothers, who charged with the comission of this dreadful<p>crime,-being another awful warning, in addition to the terrible  <p>piots some years ago, against the danger of keeping up the present<p>practice of beginning the New year.<p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  It is with the greatest pain that we announce to the public,that<p>notwith standing the generally peaceable manner in which the ushering<p>in of the New Year was conducted by the numerous and joyous parties<p>who,as is customary, pareded the street during the last night, the<p>year has commenced with theperpetration of a most horried and cruel<p>Murder, committed in the very midst of the festivities.<p>The forehead of the unfortunate woman was cut and bruised, and<br>there was a dreadful wound in the abdomen, reaching from the lower<p>part upwards,through an extent of about ten inches.<p>The victim of this dreadful crime was a Mrs Calderhead, wife of a<br>potato dealer, residing in Fountain Bridge, who, with his now mur-<br>dered wife, bad sat up to receive their New Year's visitors, and who<p>some time with them  drinking.<p>When these men went away, about three o'clock in the morning,<br>Mrs Calderhead took the candle and shewed  them down stairs.<p>In a short time afterwards, Mr Calderhead, on going to look for his<br>wife, found her at the foot of the stairs, a lifeless corpse !<p>The brothers, under these circumstances, have been apprehended on<br>suspicion. In the present stage of the matter, it would be improper<p>to mention their names.<p>The deceased was about forty years of age.<p>SECOND EDITION.------FURTHER PARTICULARS.<p>(From The Courant of this morning.)<p>Early on the morning of Saturday last, Mrs Calderhead, Dunbar<br>street; near Lochrin, came by her death under rather singular circum-<p>stances. In the morning,whena first-footing we believe she en-<p>countered two men on her own stair, between whom and herself there<br>had been some previous grudge. Words ensued, and were followed<br>by blows and kicks, and in the scuffle the unfortunate woman was<br>thrown down stairs to the flat below. Whether in the fall or from a ,<br>stab after she fell, it has not been exactly  ascertained, bbt she received<br>a wound in the abdomen, which caused such a lots of  blood  that she<br>died in a short time. Two men, labourer at the canal,are in custody,<br>supected of  being  concerned in this outrage. The deceased was well<p>known in Edinburg; she usually accompanied her husband in<br>hawking potatoes in a cart through the streets. she has left five<br>children.<p>POLICE COURT.<p>BEFORE  JAMES PATISON,  F.sq.,BAILIE<p>Two Gentleman; (brothers.) and an old  Lady, the keeper of <br>lodging house, were charged by a hackney coach preprietor with for<br>cibly taking possession of his coach, at the Palace Yard, on the even<br>ing of the 19th. cart.<p>One of the defenders stated that he ought to have been the com<p>plainer,-and that after the present case was investigated he would<p>prefer a charge against the complainer. He then went on  to state<br>that on Sunday week he and his brother had dined in the New Town;<br>and in the evening they had engaged the coachman to drive them to<br>their lodgings at the foot of the Canongate. When they alighted the<br>complainer claimed  7s. 6d. as his hire ; but they (the defender<br>knowing  the regular fare to be 2s. 3d. refused to pay the complainer<br>any thing, and wished to know the number of his coach, which he<br>prevented them from learning, by placing his back against the door.<br>They (the defenders) then mounted  the dicky, with the intention<br>of detaining the coach. A scuffle then ensued, and one of them got<br>his cloke (which was entirely made of fur,) torn from the collar to the<br>foot.<p>The complainer denied the truth of the defenders' statement, and<br>.said that it could be proved by a man who had been on the dicky<br>with him at the time, but who was BOW it Dunkeld. He offered.<br>however, to pay the expense of bringing the man to Edinburgh. it<br>the case wero' continued for eight days. The complainer further<br>stated that he bad gone into the defenders' lodgings with the intention<br>of taking some article of furniture to pay his fare; but the landlaer.<br>becoming afraid .of her property, went OK and took the horses by the<br>head, and he was then' obliged to leave the house to  took after his<br>coach.<p>The case was continued.<p>Forbes and Owen, Printers, 136, High Street </p>
