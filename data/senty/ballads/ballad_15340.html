	<p>  DREADFUL<p>FIRE<p>IN LONDON.<p> <br>Full and correct account of that dreadful&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and  awful Fire<p>which happened at the house of Lord Walsingham, in<p><p>Cavendish Square, London, on the morning of Wed-<br>nesday last, when his Lordship's body was burned to<p><p>ashes, and Lady Walsingham, to save her life, had<br>jumped over a window, and her mangled body was found<br>in the back yard, and she died in a, few hours.<p><p>(From the Caledonian Mercury.)<p><br>This morning a fire dreadful rather in its consequences .<p>to human life than for the ravages of the flames, broke<br>out at the residence of Lord Walsingham, at No. 55, Up-<br>per Harley Street, Cavendish Square. The fire was first<br>discovered by Mr Wigram, who resides next door to Lord<br>Walsingham. He instantly gave the alarm, and sent his <p>own servants to knock at the door. The flames were at<br>this time bursting out of the bed room window of the<br>noble Lord.<p>The servants proceeded to the room of the noble Lord, <br>which was found to be in one mass of flame and smoke,<br>and it was impossible to ascertain the fate of his Lordship.<br>A party of police now arrived, and preserved order. The<br>Royal Exchange engine, the County, and the Sun com-<br>menced playing on the premises, and having a good sup-<br>ply of water, prevented the fire from spreading.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<p>The servants proceeded to the apartment of Lady Wal-<br>singham, and gave the alarm, but her Ladyship,  instead<br>of coming down stairs, in the hurry of the moment, jump-<br>ed over a window, into a back yard, where she was found<br>soon after, in the most shocking state of mutilation ; both<br>her thighs and arms&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;were broken.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  She lingered till five<br>o'clock, when death put a period to her sufferings.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The<br>servants and officers then went to the room of Lord Wal-<br>singhain, and found his remains in  a  state of entire  de-<br>struction ; it was impossible to recognise  the&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;melancholy<br>remnant of mortality, so entirely had the flames wrought<br>the work of destruction.<p>The origin of the fire has not yet been ascertained, but<br>it is supposed that the curtains had taken fire by the<br>candle.<p>His Lordship was in his 55th year. He was a Lieu-<br>tenant-General in the army,  and Lieutenant Colonel of<br>the 1st regiment of Dragoons.<p>Price One Penny.</p>
