On the afternoon of<br>Friday  part of the conviets were ainng on deck, while Mr Monk-<br>land, first mate Mr Wat'S boatswain, accompanied by 11 seamen,<br>went into the hold to see that all was right, and all the prioners<br>safe (as much discontent was apparent for some days past) we<br>being neary 1000 miles from Gibraltar. They were proceeding<br>to call the Roll, when they were. answered ' Here, but not Here<br>long".

This Was the signal hat was agreed on ; in an instant<br>the party were- assailed with every kind of weapon, that the pris<br>oners Could procure. The lantern was put our, and the party<br>fought in the dark ; many of the Sailors rashed imprudently into<br>the hold while the cry for the arms resounded from stem to stern.<br>The, Scene at this moment can better be imagined than described<br>I was stationed near the armoury door; the prisoner's on deck tore:<br>.down the ships pail[  ], and attacked the crew on all sides.

The rush now was for the spirit room, and after pro-<br>curing a quantity of the beverage, they began to Song, dance and<br>use all the extrav gance of victors wholly relieved from bondage.<br>It was such a sight that I never experienced ; the Ship was alow-<br>ed to drift unheeded in the wid deep with out even a sailor on<br>deck. Some of the kinder souls, who, perhaps, had experienced<br>some good treatment at our hands, or feeling for aur unhapy con<br> dition, came below and. plied us well with rum, so that we were<br>in a comparative happy state, especially when they<br>assured us that we should receive nothing bu kind<br>ness from their hands. In she morning we were all<br>brought ou deck, and a woman was pointed out to us<br>as our future commander, at least the business of the<br>Ship was to be under her sole direction.
