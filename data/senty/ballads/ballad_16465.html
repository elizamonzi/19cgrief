	<p> Edinburgh Irish Festival:<p>OR, THE<p>POPISH SHOWMAN.<p>An Account of the Procession, and Progress of<br>Dan, King of the Beggars, in Edinburgh.<p><p>DANIEL the First, King of the Beggars, and by a strange and wonderful anomaly,<br>Premier of Great Britain and Ireland, made his entree to the capital of Caledonia on the<br>17th current, about noon. At an early hour in the morning it was easy to be perceived,<br>from the unusal bustle among the Emeralders, and the distant yells of the bag pipes and<br>drums mustering the devotees, that the advent of the Big-Beggar man was at hand. The<br>denizens of that ancient liberty, the Cowgate, quickly responded to the reveille?many a<br>hod got a day's rest, and many a donkey brayed in honour of the great O'CONNELL for<br>the holiday, for the boys were determined that neither pigs nor potatoes would bother<br>them on that blessed morning?they therefore fell in, and proceeded to join their bre-<br>thren, the children of holy St. Mary's, where they received their colours, and arranged<br>the order of march, previous to which, Father Keening, of the Ripale Chapel, blessed<br>the " army," absolved it from all mortal sin, and gave it the honourable title of the Royal<br>O'Connell Body Guards, or St. Mary's Rangers. Thereafter the united forces marched<br>in firm battalion, upwards of 300 strong, (hear it, Joe Hume?every one of them sworn<br>and incorporated Ribbonmen) up the High-Street to the tune of tunes, St Patrick's Day.<br>The "brigade," every mother's son of them, were decorated with the usual emblems of<br>rebellion, green sashes and tri-coloured knots on their breasts, and sported about four or<br>five banners and standards, on one of which was the good looking countenance of the<br>great Liberator himself. Thus constituted, the Body Guards joined a tumultuous assem-<br>blage on the Mound, nicknamed the " Trades," (for the great majority of the respectable<br>artisans refused to grace or aid the O'Connell rising) consisted of a few starved brick-<br>layers connected with the " strike," cobblers, sweeps, tailors, tinkers, ropemakers, Re-<br>form Unions, and other idle blackguards the greater part of whom were raw boys, in all<br>about 250.<p>The whole force then broke up for Newington, to join the rest of the cortege appoint-<br>ed to conduct Ireland's Jewel into Protestant Edina.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the satisfaction of our general<br>readers, we give the order of procession as it moved into the City of John Knox :?<p>Drum and Fife of the Old Town Guard,<br>A strong body of Police,<br>Chimney Sweeps, two and two, with new brooms, supporting an effigy of Lord Brougham<br>with clean hands.<br>Grave-diggers, with a congratulatory address for O'Connell's encouragement of<br>their trade in Ireland.<br>Colliers, with a petition, praying that his Danship may  direct coals to be used instead of<br>fagots, in lighting up the fires of Smithfield, when autos-da-fe for the<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Protestants are again commenced.<br>Gilmerton Carters, with an offer to volunteer to Ireland to assist the Whitefeet during<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the ensuing winter.<br>The Society of Sturdy Beggars, carrying a beautiful portrait of King Dan, their<br>acknowledged Sovereign.<br>The Edinburgh Jews, with an offer to contribute a twelvemonth's Christian plunder on<br>the next Day of Atonement, for the emancipation of " our peoplesh ; ''?twenty<br>per shent dishcount for ready monish.<p>The Gentlemen connected with the Liberal Press of Edinburgh, with a memorial as to the<br>proper application of the Secret-Service Money?with the Editor of the Scratchman<br>in sackcloth and ashes, eating the Fast-day number of his filthy  journal.<br>Band of Bagpipes, playing the Dead March in Saul.<p>THE BURGHER SYNOD,<br>with Potter-row John at their head, supported by the Rev. Messrs Nicebit and Whalley,<br>habited as Dominican Friars, with their Geneva bands reversed and pinned on their <br>hinder parts, carrying the Death's-head and Cross-bones, for the edification of<br>the Irish Protestants and the terror of Scotch Anythingarians.<p>Barney  O'Whack, doorkeeper to the Convent of St Margaret's?originally intended for<br>the Church, and found wanting, but thought fit enough for the Convent?a servant<br>of all work, with his truncheon of office in his hand.<p>THE MOTHER  ABBESS,<p>and 20 Sisters of Charity, leading in their right hands 20 young girls, pupils of the Estab-<br>lishment, converted to Popery.<br>Mrs Laidlaw, and the Society  of Midwives,with an Address on the prospect of the in-<br>creasing Papist population.<p>PRIOR GULL-US OF ACHEUL,<br>as Ignatius Loyola, in his robes of office.<p>THE RACK WHEEL,<br>supported by four familiars of the Inquisition lately  escaped from Spain. Bailie M 'Wheeble<br>and Small-talk Jemmy-son dressed as imps and tormentors.<p>TWELVE PRIESTS.<br>two and two, supporting a box containing thumb-screws and " dens theology. "<p>FATHER M'HALE.<br>carrying a Bull from the Pope excommunicating the Brothers Finn, for exposing and<br>insulting the Liberathor.<br>Brass band?tune, " Erin go brach,"<p>THREE COMPANIES OF THE ROYAL O'CONNELL GUARDS,<br>commanded by the celebrated Major Lackey of Ballinahinch.<br>Tinkers, Tailors, Ropemakers, Cobblers, as aforementioned.<p>EDINBURGH WHIG CLIQUE,<p>incog., and in the disguise of gentlemen, closed the procession. Sir James had given the<br>strictest orders that they should not countenance the Festival in their proper character,<br>lest they might hurt its respectability.<p>In the above order the Procession moved along the Bridges till it reached the Water-<br>loo, where the Great Dan alighted, and received the respective addresses and congratula-<br>tions abovementioned. The Sisters of Charity then proceeded to exercise that hospitable<br>token of affection and love, the washing his Sub-holiness' feet in holy water, and which<br>were then dried by the perfumed handkerchiefs of the pious Sisterhood, the mother abbess<br>devoutly crossing herself as she passed her hand up and down Dan's brawny leg. The<br>moved to the hustings on the Calton hill, which were occupied by the ordinary apostles of<br>froth and sedition. The Beggar man then lifted his voice aloud?cursed the House of<br>Lords?denounced the Tories?praised Scotland, and declared the Calton mountain finer<br>than the Hill of Howth ; in which he was joined by Maurish, who declared that he would<br>rather be obliged to fight D'Israelli than have lost the sight.<p>A shower of rain at length dispersed the greater part of the crowd, which, owing to the<br>day, was at first numerous. There was no feeling manifested but that of curiosity and<br>contempt. It was hardly possible for his partizans to muster a faint cheer, while the<br>assemblage remained profoundly silent. None cried, " God save him !" and after the<br>usual balderdash, the Meeting broke up, and the boys went to dress for dinner.<p>" O' Connell ! the foul calumniator of the best and bravest of the land, the most impu-<br>dent of mountebanks, the most restless of agitators, the most beggarly of beggars, the<br>most worthless of slanderers, the bitter enemy of the peace and welfare of his country. "<p>They who praise him are like unto him, and honour, virtue, and decency they know not.<br>Reprinted from the AGe, for James Bonnar & Co.</p>
