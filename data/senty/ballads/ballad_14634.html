	<p> SUICIDE<p>AND<p>MURDER!<p>A particular account of the unfortunate Miss Eliza-<br>beth Wilson, a female of seduction.<p>ELIZABETH WILSON, a respectable farmer's daughter, near<br>Kirkaldy, in the county of Fife, being of a beautiful appearance,<br>she was courted by several young gentlemen of respectability, who<br>used every means in their power to make her comply, but her<br>mind revolted at the idea of such proceedings. She lately formed<br>a correspondence with a uobleman from the North, far above her<br>station in life, who held out many false promises, till at last she<br>complied to his wishes. He kept her for sometime, and afterwards<br>left her in poverty. Being in this wretched situation, she took the<br>fatal resolution of putting an end to her life by poison, but before<br>taking it; she wrote three letters, two of which follow:<p>'Dear Sir, The life that you have  made so miserable is now<br>'near an end ; I wish not to upbraid you, but wish every pro-<br>sperity towards you.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  E. W.'<p>'Dear Sister....I let you know that the time is come which will<br>'put an end to all my sufferings;  and before you receive this, I<br>'will be no more.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;E. W.'<p>She then swallowed the poison, and soon died in the  greatest<br>agony, about 3 o'clock on Friday morning.<p>The above letters were found at her lodgings shortly after she<br>had taken the fatal draught, one of which, by desire of her friends,<br>was kept secret. This lamentable occurrence ought to be a warn-<br>ing to young women from the delusion of persons above  their rank.<p>Execution at Derby on Monday last.<p>AT the last&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Assizes held here, JANET COOPER,  aged 34, was<br>indicted for the murder of her step daughter, a girl of seven years<br>of age, by locking her up in a cellar for six days and nights, with-<br>out provisions, by which means the poor girl had died in the most<br>deplorable  situation,  after having eat some of the straw on which<br>she was lying. The evidence clearly proved that she was the per-<br>petrator of this dreadful and unparalleled atrocity. The Jury, with-<br>out any hesitation, found her guilty.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Judge  then  proceeded<br>for to pass the  sentence of Death, and directed that  she should be<br>executed  or Monday first, and that her body should be given for<br>dissection. He most earnestly exhorted  her to make preparations<br>for another world, and remarked, 'that  she  was one of the most<br>cruel and wicked women that ever had  come  under his observa-<br>tion;'  he also said,  'that the sentence should  be put in execution,<br>for a certainty, she should  be made a public example, if ever one<br>was.'&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She  conducted herself with firmness during her trial, but<br>afterwards showed some  symptoms of despair, and seemed to re-<br>flect on former  base and  wicked  conduct.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She never confessed<br>till the night before  her Execution, when she fully acknowledged<br>that  she  had committed  the  murder, and that her sentence was<br>just. The chaplain of the jail paid  every  attention to her during<br>her imprisonment, to whose exhortations she  paid great attention,<br>but  seemed  afraid  to meet the awful fate which she was doomed<br>to suffer. The  night before  her execution, she was waited on by<br>three clergymen, who commenced prayer, in which she joined with<br>fervency ; she was also visited  by some of her relatives, a few<br>days previous to her execution, the parting scene was very affecting<br>to every person present.<p>Shortly after 12 o'clock, she melancholy ascended the scaffold,<br> where a most fervent prayer was given by the Rev. Mr Thomson;<br>a portion of a hymn being also sung, the unfortunate culprit made<br>an attempt to address the crowd, but their yells against her were<br>so tremendous, that she failed. She had two children of her own,<br>the youngest of which she requested for to see before she departed<br>this life; it was brought by order of the Sheriff, and the scene was<br>very affecting. The child being taken from her, she prayed very<br>earnestly for a few minutes, when she dropt the signal and was<br>launched into eternity. After hanging nearly an hour, her body<br>was out down, and given to the Surgeons for dissection.,<p>Printed by W, Robertson ....Price Ond Penny.<p></p>
