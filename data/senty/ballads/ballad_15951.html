	<h2>Transcription</h2>
	<p> A COMICAL<p>Wedding,<p>Between an Old Bachelor 65 years of age,<br>and a Young Woman of 19<p>The inhabitants of this town were highly<br>delighted and amused on the night of Tues-<br>day last, by a Wedding of rather a singular<br>and uncommon description which took place<br>here on that day, and afforded no little sport<br>to the young and old of both sexes, who had<br>assembled in great numbers to meet the<br>wedding-party returning from the house of<br>the Rev. Mr---------; but, which ended in<br>creat trouble to the luckless bridegroom, by<br>name A------M--------. a bachelor of sixty-<br>five years of age, who was completely duped<br>by a young man named J------B---------, a<br>former lover of the fair but faithless bride.<br>The bride's name is Jane R---------, and she<br>has lately completed her nineteenth year,<p>As soon as they made their appearance'<br>the aged bridegroom was assailed by the<br>most tremendous cheers, groans, and hisses,<br>by the assembled crowd. He was evidently<br>prepared for the reception he met with, but<br>not so the bride, who being one who could<br>out-run the moat of the assailants, put mettle<br>in her heels, and lost no time in making her<br>escape, and arrived safe at the house which<br>was intended for her new home.<p>The remainder of the party having weather-<br>ed the storm, got into port along with her. Af-<br>ter all these things were over, they sat down<br>to supper, which was followed by mighty<br>rivers of Mountain Dew, and a great number<br>of uninvited guests having arrived, among<br>whom were J. B. the bride's former lover.<br>Songs and mirth then commenced, and al<br>went on as happy as a marriage bell, till a<br>trifling circumstance occured which com-<br>pletely marred the prosperity of the evening<br>Their heads being now turned with drink,<br>most of the party were completely mesmer-<br>ized on the destructive bumps. This was<br>occasioned by some unfavourable remark<br>made on the singing of a song.<p>The little spark soon kindled into a flame,<br>and a general battle ensued?glasses and<br>tumblers were flying in all directions like<br>snow balls, even the poker, tongs, and fen-<br>der were put in requisition in this amusing<br>scene. The engagement was so hot, that<br>several tailors, shoemakers, barbers, old<br>maids, and wanton widows were severely<br>wounded in the affray. In the midst of h<br>confusion, the bridegroom escaped into an<br>adjoining room, where, after the 'atigues of<br>the night, he fell asleep ; but alas ! when he<br>awoke out of his slumber, what was his sur-<br>prise to find no one in the house but himself;<br>and, to add to his difficulties, on going to his<br>chest he found, to his amazement and grief, ..<br>that Jane R., his fickle bride, had decamped<br>with all his money, amounting to £180, 6s.,<br>taking her former sweetheart J. B. along with<br>her, leaving the bachelor to look out for an-<br>other help-mate more faithful than his last.<p>Sanderson, Printer, high Street, Edinburgh</p>
