	<p> Murder and Robbery.<p>An Account of a most Horrid Murder,<br>supposed to be commited on the body<br>of Mr MARK Dow, a respectab Shoe-<br>maker in Leith Street, Edinburgh, on<br>Wednesday Evening the 10th or early ,<p>on Thursday morning, the 11th Jan-<br>uary,1827, who was found dead near-<br>ly naked, at  the bottom of a stair,<br>north west corner of Bank Street, with<br>& large wound on h s head.<p>Edin. 12th January, 1827.<p>The following account of this horrible transac-<br>tion is copied from the " Edinhurgh Observer,"<br>Newspaper of this day, which is the only authentic<br>notification yet published of this melancholy affair.<p>" A  VERY extraordinary sensation ware&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ated<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;throughout this city, caused by the report<br>of a most respectable tradesman, Mr Mark Dow,<br>Shoemaker, Leith Street, having been found mur-<br>dered, about one o'clock that morning.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The facts<br>of this catastrophe, as far as can yet be learned, are<br>shortly these :?On Wednesday Mr Dow was pre<br>sent at a dinner in Mrs Ferguson's Tavern, Lawn-<br>market,  of the incorporation  of Shoemakers, of<br>which incorporation he was Treasurer.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He left the<br>Tavern about eleven o'clock, with upwards of £40<br>in cash, besides a bill for a considerable amount, in<br>his possession, apparently sober; and by a quarter<br>past one o'clock of the following morning he was<br>found, without coat, vest, hat, and shoes, lying dead<br>at the bottom of a stair at the north west corner of<br>Bank-Strret, with a large wound on his head, from<br>which a considerable quantity of blood had flowed,<br>but there was no contusion.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Near the stair, but<br>round the corner, is a house from the door of which<br>there  is a sort of subterraneous  communication<br>with the stair where Mr Dow was found.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The<br>landlord of this house, it is said was out on some<br>bussiness, and was returning home, and not getting<br>admission by the usual entrance, intending to get<br>to round  by this passage,  went  down  stairs,  and<br>stumbled over the body of Mr Dow.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He imme-<br>diately gave information to a watchman, and the<br>corpse was conveyed to the Police Office.<p>An active shrewd officer of that establishment,<br>named Smail, being out, and hearing a man state<br>that a murder had been commited, and that the<br>informent had seen the hat of the unhappy sufferer<br>burnt, contrived to get the narrator of the tale in-<br>duced to go to the Police Office, from whence he<br>and a party was dispatched to the before-mentioned<br>house, where they found a quantity of ashes, which<br>they presumed were the remains of the hat and<br>vest; and, upon examination, the coat and shoes, a<br>small sum of money, and the bill were found.<p>Four or five different individuals are now in cus-<br>tody,and the Sheriff has instated an inquiry into<br>the. circumstances.<p>Mr Dow was, we understand, a widower, and<br>has left a family of five children."<p>Printed for Wm. Henry------Price One Penny;<p></p>
