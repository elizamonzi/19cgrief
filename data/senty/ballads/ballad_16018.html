Archibald,<br>Neilson, and two Divines, when the whole night was spent in singing of psalms, and<br>prayer, and exhorting him to fly from the wrath to come, and to the Lord Jesus Christ, in-<br>structing him in the knowledge of Christ, and the way of salvation, and righteousness; when<br>he made a large confession of the sins of his nature, heart, and life, and took his turn in pray-<br>er with them that were present, when the scaffolding was putting up, his mind was crowded<br>with terror and confusion, which appeared in his countenance, when he cried out, O! to be<br>sprinkled with the blood of Christ, which only can cleanse me from my sin. Then he was<br>desired to go about prayer, which he did accordingly, after which he was more composed in<br>his mind.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At two o'clock, he was taken out of the iron room, to the town-hall drest in<br>his dead cloaths, and a white gown down to his feet, mounted with black, attended by the<br>Revd. Messrs. Balsour and Bell, and Mr. Neilson, on whom he lerned down the stairs to the<br>Hall, when he sung a part of the sixty-second Psalm 5, 6, 7, verses, after which he prayed,<br>and then Messrs. Balsour and Bell, questioned him concerning the murder of his Child, which<br>he denied, that ever he embrued his hands in his blood, but owned he was a mean of his<br>death, and was willing to suffer for it.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After which Messrs, Balsour and Bell gave him suit-<br>ble exhortations,when the lord Provost, asked him if he had any thing further to say, as<br>the time was drawing on, to which he answered, No! when Mr. Bell prayed, he then took<br>farewall of the ministers, and came away to the scaffold , accordingly, then he desired Mr.<br>Neilson to pray, which was done with great servency, when a part of the 24 Psalm was<br>sung from the 7th verse to the end. then he prayed himself, after which he turned to the<br>spectators desiring them, to observe the ten commandments, and went through them one by<br>one, observing that there might be some among such a great multitude, who are living in sin,<br>as he had, and prayed them to take warning.<p>After which one of the Magistrates, asked him if he had any family or friends, that the<br>Magisters of Glasgow, could do any thing for them; he answered, No! but thanked them<br>kindly, after which he went to the foot of the ladder, and took farewell of Mr. Neilson,<br>when the tears ran down his cheeks, he then went up the ladder. After the cap being<br>drawn over his face, and seemingly in a praying posture he appeared to saint, on which the<br>executioner did his office immediately<p>On his being cut down, his body was put in a coffin, and laid on a cart, and carried to the<br>College to be, dissected, and attended by the Magistrates, likewise escorted by a party of the<br>42d Regiment of foot.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<p>  The unfortunate James Day is a woful example of the depravity of human nature, when<br>further corrupted by the debauched company of loose women.?He had education parts and<br>abilities to make a figure as a tradesman; but his giving himself up to lust, and doating on<br>strange women led him astray from the paths of virtue: and, pride, the very sin which made SAtan, A Devil from an Angel of light, perverted his mind.<p> No doubt, the confession of a great many particular sins has no tendency to reform man-<br>kind: it rather leads poor mortals to a vain conceit of themselves, and the guilty, to palliate<br>their own sins, by thinking them of an inferior fort to the black catalogue they read of  or<br>see before them. In this case, let every one consider, that it is only the over ruling band of<br>Providence which keeps FALLEN  MAN from running into the most wicked, base and degener-<br>ate courses.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  <p> The man, or woman, who indulge themselves in licentious amours, will undoubtedly feel a<br>sting in their conscience, which no salve can cure: witness this man, who says, in his own<br>hand writing, that he never had a heart love for this Adulterous Child, As a bird of a bad<br>nest.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <p>During his confinement and under sentence, he behaved with the greatest  fortitude con-<br>versed freely and acted as composed, as conscious innocence could do: Yet his own account of<br>his wandering the child leaves a suspicion of his being the actual Murderer.</p>
