	<p> Trial & Sentence<p>Of WILLIAM M'INTYRE, an unfortunate Tailor, belong.<br>ing to Paisley, who was tried before the High Court of<br>Justiciary at Edinburgh, on Monday the 20th January, 1823,<br>and sentenced to be executed there on Wednesday the 26th<br>day of February next, betwixt 3 and 10 o'clock in the morn-<br>ing, for Housebreaking and Theft.<p>Edinburgh, Monday, December 20.?This day WILLIAM M'INTYRE was placed<br>at the Bar charged with the crimes of Housebreaking and Theft, perpetrated early in<br>the morning of the 3d of October, in the premises of Braehouse, in the Lothian Road,<br>at the west end of Prince's Street, the residence of Miss Ann Butler, and stealing<br>a large quantity of wearing apparel, to which the prisoner pleaded Not Guilty.<p>Murdoch M'Leod a watchman, heard a noise in Brachouse about two o'clock in<br>the morning of the 3d of October, and knowing the family was out of town, he cal-<br>led the next watchman, R. M'Intosh, and proceeded to examine the premises. M'-<br>In'tosh looked over the dyke and saw a window broken. Witness went to the front<br>of the house, and on his return to the back, M'Intosh called out that the thieves were<br>away, he having seen three jump out of a window. They ran through the garden<br>and got over the wall into a park, witness and M'Intosh pursuing; witness caught the<br>prisoner at the bar, whom he positively identified. Followed the track of feet in the<br>garden, and at the distance of 50 or 60 yards from the window found a black silk<br>gown. Several other witnesses were examined; after which<p>The declaration of the prisoner was lead, from which it appeared that he was born<br>in Paisley, had been a tailor in Glasgow, and came here for employment; that he<br>had been drinking the night previous to his apprehension, and for want of lodgings<br>went to sleep in a park, where he was roused by the cry of " Stop Thief," and was<br>taken into custody, at which time he saw two persons running.<p>The Jury after a very few minutes consultation, without leaving the box, found<br>the prisoner GUILTY of the crimes libelled.<p>The Lord Justice Clerk then proceeded to address the unhappy youth, expressing<br>his sorrow that in consequence of the verdict of a most respectable Jury it had fallen<br>to his lot to fulfil a melancholy duty. His Lordship said, the crime of housebreak-<br>ing had become so extremely frequent, as to lead to the supposition that it was not<br>regarded as a capital crime, but the example about to be made would prove the con-<br>trary. His Lordship remarked that, as it was the duty of all to prepare for the great<br>change which awaited them, it was peculiarly so for one whose days were numbered,<br>and earnestly besought the unfortunate young man not to waste the short time that<br>remained to him in this world, but by a thorough, sencere, and heartfelt repentence,<br>endeavour to obtain the forgivness of Almighty God,<p>His Lordship concluded by reading the awful sentence, which condemned the un-<br>happy victim to the injured laws of his country, to be executed on the 26th of Feb-<br>ruary.<p>He is only seventeen years of age; notwithstanding his efforts to hear his fate an-<br>nounced with fortitude, he was evidently great distressed, and shed tears from the<br>moment the verdict was returned.<p>There are no fewer than six wretched beings at present under sentence of death in<br>Scotland, viz. C. M'Laren, T. Grierson, James M'Ewan, and William M'Intyre, for<br>housebreaking, all young boys, lying in the Jail of Edinburgh; and James Robertson<br>and Robert Simpson, for robbing the Caledonian coach at Inverness, in the Jail of<br>which place they are now confined.<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Printed by John Muir, Glasgow.</p>
