	<p> A Full and Particular Account of the Trial and Sentence of WIL-<br>LIAM BURKE and HELEN McDOUGALL, his reputed wife,<br>who were tried before the High Court of Justiciary at Edinburgh,<br>on Wednesday the 24th December, 1828, and Burke is to be<br>Executed, on Wednesday the 28th January, 1829, and his body<br>to be given for dissection.<p>YESTERDAY, came on before  the High Court of Justiciary<br>the trial of William Burke and Helen M'Dougall, for Mur-<br>der....1st, Burke, with the murder of Mary Paterson or Mitchell, in<br>Cibb's Close, Canongate, Edinburgh, between 7th and 16th April<br>1828.....2d, Burke with the murder, between 5th and 26th October,<br>in Tanner's Close, Portsbnrgh, of James Wilson, commonly called<br>Daft Jamie. 3d, Burke and Helen McDougall, for the murder of<br>Madgy, or Margery, or Mary McGonegal, or Duffie, or Campbell,<br>or Docherty, on the 31st October, in Burke's house, Wester Ports- <br>burgh. There are 55 witnesses. The manner of the murders<br>being penetrated is stated, in the indicmeni, by Burke throwing<br>himself upon the bodies of the victims, and pressing them to death,<br>holding their mouth and nose. Daft Jamie is stated to have held<br>a deadly struggle with the murderer. The prisoners were charged<br>with intent to sell to physicians or surgeons as subjects for dissec-<br>tion.<p>The first witness that was called was Ann Black or Connaway,<br>who lived in Wester Portsburgh, who, after described the situation<br>of her house, stated, that the woman M'Dougall lived with Burke,<br>and had seen Hare and his wife coming about them. On Friday,<br>31st October, (Halloe'en) about mid-day, witness saw Burke pass<br>along the passage, going inward, with a woman following him,<br>who was a stranger and whom witness had never seen before.<br>About three o'clock afternoon, witness went into Burke's house and<br>found the woman whom she had seen going with Burke sitting at<br>the fire, supping porridge and milk. She had her head tied up in<br>a handkerchief. Witness said " I see you have got a stranger."<br>Mrs. McDougall replied they had got a friend of her husband's, a<br>Highland woman. A little while after, a girl, whose name she un-<br>derstood to be Paterson, came and asked for her husband ; it turn-<br>ed out that it was Burke she wanted. Witness went into Burke's<br>house, where she found McDougall, Burke, and Mrs. Law, and<br>youg Broggan drinking. Burke had a bottle of spirits in his hand.<br>He filled out a glass and then dashed out the spirits on a bed.<br>Witness asked McDougall what had become of the old woman,<br>She replied, Burke and her were too friendly together, and that she<br>had kicked her out of the house, asking at the same time, " Did<br>you hear it?" Observed a bundle of straw at the bottom of the<br>bed. Witness left Burke's house a little after ten. Went in again<br>with Gray's wife to see what she had told her of. She saw no-<br>thing, but was so frightened, that she came out again without see-<br>ing any thing. The straw was turned. Did not see Burke till far<br>on in the night, till it was reported that he had murdered a woman.<br>Burke said he would go and see the man who said he had done<br>amiss, and when he went to the passage the Police apprehended him.<p>Hugh Alston lived in the same land with. Burke. On 31st Oc-<br>tober, about 11 o'clock, heard a woman crying murder ; went to<br>the flat where Burke resided, halting within a yard of Connoway's.<br>door, and then he listened. Heard two men as if wrangling and<br>struggling, and the woman crying murder, but did not consider her in imminent danger. That continued for about a minute, and then he heard a cry as if a person had been strangled. The same female's voice that bad cried murder was struck as by the soft part of the hand, and called " Police, for there is murder here." He was about three yards from the door that leads to Burke's house, whin he heard the three remarkable sounds. On Saturday evening heard of a body being found, which enabled him to fix the subject in his memory.<p>David Paterson, keeper of the museum belonging to Dr Know. Knows the pri-<br>soner by sight. Witness went home on the 31st of October, about 12 o'clock, found<br>Burke knocking at the door. Burke wished to see him at his house, and he went<br>aocordingly, he found two men, including Burke, and two women there. Burke<br>said to him, he had procured something for the doctor; pointing to the head of a<br>bed where straw was lying. Witness understood he alluded to a dead body.<br>McDougall was one of the women in company thought he would know the other.<br>Witness sent his sister next morning for Burke, (witness was here shown Hare and<br>his wife, whom he identified as being in Burke's house on the 31 st October.) Burke<br>came next morning at 9 o'clock, and witness said, if he had any thing to give to Dr<br>Knox, to settle with himself. Burke, Hare, and a porter, came with an old tea-<br>where he saw an old woman, who appeared to be into intoxicated. The old woman<br>having fallen, Burke stood stridelegs over her, and laid himself down abover her;<br>his breast being on her head, she gave a cry, and then moaned a little. He pat one<br>hand on her nose and mouth, and the other under her chin, until she was dead.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After a long and interesting Trial, which lasteat twenty-four hours, William Burke<br>was found Guilty, and the libel against Macdougall Not Proven. Burke was then<br>sentenced to be executed at Edinburgh on Wednesday the 28th of January 1829,<br>and his body given for dissection.</p>
