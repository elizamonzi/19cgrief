Give thy Angels charge over me at the Hour of Death.<br>I acknowledge myself a great Sinner, and much given to that of Un-<br>cleanness, which has brought me to this shameful and untimely End.<p>I went to service in the Multrees  hill, in the first of June last, and<br>being with Child by a young Man, whose Name I forbear to mention ; I<br>took all possible Care to conceal it, but being come to my Time, and going<br>a little Way off from my Master's House I unexepectdly took traveling and<br>was there delivered without Assistance,nor did I call for any, altho' I knew<br>there was People within hearing of me. The Child being born, I laid it<br>among the Corn and returned to my Master's House, but soon after, the<br>truth was suspected, and upon Examination, I was found guilty, for<br>which I am to suffer this Day.<p>Wash my guilty Soul in the peace-speaking Blood of my Redeemer,<br>O God of my Salvation, and my Tongue shall sing aloud of thy Righteous-<br>ness.<p>O that this may be a Warning to all young Women, and others,<br>from trusting to the smooth and deluding Speeches of young Men. I<br>acknowledge the tender Regard of the Ministers of this City have<br>shewn&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;for promoting my eternal Welfare, and especially to Mr. Glen<br>and Mr. Dick, tor their pious Care about my Soul; the Lord grant them<br>Success in all their Ministrations.<p>All along free and ready Access has been granted to such as could<br>any ways further me in my spiritual Progress. I earnestly beg the Prayers<br>of all who are Witnesses  of my Death this Day, that God would have<br>Mercy on my Soul, and assist me in my Extremity, that after my De-<br>parture hence in Peace, I may meet, O Lord, with thy Favour, and be<br>received into thy everlasting Kingdom, through the Merits and Media-<br>tion of thine only Son, Jesus Christ, our blessed Lord and Saviour.<p>Labour early to have suitable Impressions of God upon your Spirits, and<br>right  Notions of his absolute Purity and spotless Holiness; be affraid<br>to sin against  him,for his all seeing Eye see all your Ways, and his al-<br>mighty Power can, and will reach you, if Mercy and unfeigned Repen-<br>tance prevent it not.<p>Labour to get right Views of Sin, and pray earnestly, frequently and <br>fervently to God through Christ, That you may be made to see the ex-<br>ceeding sinfulness of Sin, how repugnant it is to the pure and holy Nature<br>of God, how contrary to his Law, which is a Transcript of his spotless<br>Nature; how wounding to our blessed Saviour, and grievous to the holy<br>Spirit, and how hurtful and dangerous to the best Interests of our im-<br>mortal Souls, therefore endeavour to study a holy Life, remember that<br>nothing is hid from the all-seeing Eye of God, therefore honour him,<br>and keep his holy Commandments. Lord Jesus receive my Spirit. Amen,<p>ANN  MORISON.</p>
