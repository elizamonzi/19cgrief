	<h2>Transcription</h2>
	<p> Battle of Inkermann,<p>The Battle of Inkermann, fought and conquered by the<br>Allied Troops?British, French, Sardinians and Turks, on<br>the 5th November 1854, will ever stand, on the memory of<br>the present  generation; and on the page of history it will<br>go to the end of the world, as one of the greatest achieve-<br>ments  ever accomplished by gun, sword, and cannon. The<br>difficulties the  Allies had to encounter were great, and only<br>noble  hearts could accomplish them. Bravery on the Allies<br>side closed the day's proceedings, while many a. brave hero<br>lies now on the Crimea, having left heart broken mothers<br>and widowed wives to lament their loss?but having died<br>honourably for their country's rights, they look back with<br>melancholy and delight. Hear what the Poet now says In<br>his noble piece of Recitation, which the poet has no doubt<br>Will be recited by every school boy, and on every stage of<br>the globe till time shall be no more.'&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It can only be had in<br>the Poet's Box, 6 St Andrew's Lane, Glasgow.<p>PRICE ONE PENNY.<p>Sebastopol lay shrouded in thick November's gloom,<br>And through the midnight silence the guns  had ceas'd to boom;<br>The sentinel the outworn in watching for the morn<br>From Balaklava's heights, beheld the Russian lights<br>In the close beleagured fortress far a-down ;<br>And heard the sound of bells coming upwards through the<br>dells,<br>And the sound of mingling voices and anthems from the town.<br>They pray'd the God of Justice to thwart them in their wrong,<br>They consecrated murder with jubilee and song;<br>To the slain the joys of heaven, may their sins all be for<br>given,<br>When the promises divine had passed along their line,<br>As they gathered in their m riads ere the dawn;<br>While their priests in full ac ord chaunted glory to the Lord,<br>To bless the Russian banner and the sword for battle drawn.<br>Stealthly and dark lay amid the rain and sleet,<br>No trumpet's call resounding, drums beat, nor bugles blows<br>But shadow-like and slow came the legions of the foe,<br>Moving dimly up the steep where the British camps do sleep,<br>Lay unconscious of the danger lurking near ;<br>And the soldier breathing hard on the cold and trodden<br>sward.<br>Dreams of victory, wife and children dear.<br>Hark ! heard you not a rumbling in the misty moving air,<br>Like the rush of rising tempest when they shake the forest<br>bare?<br>The outpost on the hill hears it close and closer still,<br>Tis the tramp of iron heels, 'tis the crash of cannon wheels.<br>To arms! to arms ! is the cry, his the Russians on our flank,<br>Up and arm each British rank, and meet the gallant Guards-<br>men to conquer or to die!<br>Then rose the loud alarm with hurricane of sound,<br>From  short and easy slumber sprung each  hero to the<br>ground-<br>Sprung each horseman to his steed, ready saddled for his<br>need-<br>Sprung each soldier to his place with a stern determined face,<br>While the rousing drum and bugle echo far;<br>And the cruck of rifles wrung and the cannon found a tongue,<br>And down upon them  bursting came the avalanche of war.<br>As long as France and England shall combine their warlike<br>men,<br>Their deeds shall be remembered should the battle burst<br>again;<br>but to action so sublime will inspire each futher mind.<br>When war's alarms shall cease and the nations live in peace,<br>Free from tyranny, its murders, and its van ;<br>Let's  tell with honoured pride, how our soldiers fought and .<br>died.<br>And saved a threatened world on the heights of Inkerma nn.<p>Saturday Morning, August 8,1867.</p>
