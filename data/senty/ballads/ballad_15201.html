	<p> MURDER.<p>FOURTH EDITION.?AUTHENTIC PARTICULARS.<br>A Fourth Edition, containing New and Interesting Particulars of that<br>most heart-rending and cruel Rape, Robbery, and Murder, of Mar-<br>garet Paterson, at Gutterdike near Gilmerton, on the night of Sa-<br>turday, the 24th of April  1830?together with  a  particular&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and<br>accurate Account of the unheard of manner in which the Monsters<br>occasioned the death of their Victim, to the everlasting Disgrace of<br>Civilized Society,?and also an accurate Account and Description<br>of the two Men who are charged with committing this truly Fear<br>ful Crime, and of the Precognition taking against them by the Sheriff<br>of the County.?and likewise of the pious conduct of the I'll sated.<br>Murdered Margaret Paterson, on her  Death-Bed, a few minutes<br>before she expired,?being a True and Faithful Account of this<br>Dreadful Affair, never any where published except in this paper<p>The unhappy victim was named Margaret Paterson,?thirty-five<br>years of age,?rather tall and good-looking,?and cleanly in her per-<br>son and habits. She was formerly a servant in Edinburgh; but for<br>the last twelve months she has subsisted by travelling the country,<br>hawking laoe. She was born at Inverness; but was brought up at<br>Dalkeith,?her father having been thirty-two years employed in she<br>gardens of the Duke of Buccleugh, and being now allowed a pension<br>of six shillings a week from the present Duke.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<p>At Gutterdike, on the property of David Anderson, of Morden, Esq-<br>Banker, Edinburgh, the two men forced her through a gap in the<br>wall, on the left or east side of the road, into a field, and there by<br>force, successively violated her person. After this, the ruffians ahused<br>their victim with most shocking and brutal barbarity.<p>They dreadfully lacerated her person with some sharp instrument,<br>supposed to have been the bone of her corsets, which was afterwards<br>found on the ground, stained with blood. Her scissors also, were<br>stained with blood. The monsters then, with unparalleled barbarity.<br>forced several rough stones into the body of the ill-fated woman, and<br>also a wisp of straw, and a quantity of leaves, horse dang, and coal [  ]<p>On Wednesday last, one of the stones that had been forced<br>into her body came away from her. On Thursday, at three o'clock<br>in the afternoon, she expired, after patiently enduring the greatest ago-<br>nies, and retaining the full possession of her£ faculties till the last<br>moment.<p>On the body being opened after death, three more stones were found<br>in ft, together with the other substances we have mentioned. The<br>stones were the ordinary rough motal put upon the roads ; and one of<br>them weighed three ounces. Mortification bad taken place in the<br>parts which were most injured; and it was found that the gall bladsler<br>had been ruptured.<p>FURTHER PARTICULARS.<p>Margaret Paterson, whose inhuman murder has excited to deep and<br>universal a feeling of horror in the public mind, was resigned to die,<br>during the short time in which she breathed under the roof of her<br>father, after the shocking violence inflicted on her. About five mi-<br>nutes before her death, her mother having entered the bed roons,<br>found her sorely suffering daughter engaged in prayer. The latter<br>motioned to her mother, with her hand, to withdraw ; and she accord-<br>ingly left the room, conceiving that she wished to be left alone until<br>she had finished her devotions, In about fire minutes afterwards, she<br>again went into the room, and found the sufferer a corpse!<p>It is not true, as was at first alleged, that David Dobie formerly<br>kept a coal fold in Edinburgh. Another man from Gilmerton, of the<br>same name, had formerly kept a coal fold, which caused the mistake.<p>David Dobie, now in custody, and charged with being one of the<br>actors in this tragical case, is a native of Gilmerton, in which he has<br>eonstantly resided, employing himiself as a coal carter. He is about<br>thirty years of age,?is married to a woman from Dalkeith, by whom<br>he has three children,? the youngest of whom is not a month old He<br>is a tall, thin, but athletic man.<p>John Thomson, the other man charged with being a Principal actor<br>in the crime, is also a native of Gilmerton and a coal carter. He is<br>about wenty-two years of age,?unmarried,?and resided with Dis<br>mother.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  <p>Neither of these men was of not riously bad character.<p>It is unfortunate that medical attendance was not procured for the<br>hapless woman until after her removal to Dalkeith, when she was at-<br>tended by Drs Morrison and Renton. It is said, also, that She was<br>not attended by any Glergyman during her mortal suffering. <p>It is also much to be lamented, for the sake of public justice, what<br>no Magistrate, or other official person, took the deposition of the dying<br>woman, and that it was consequently omitted to shew to her the two<br>prisoners, Dobie and Thomson, in order that she might either identify<br>them, or declare that they were not the guilty individuals.<p>The precognition is still going on before the Sheriff.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Several wit-<br>nesses have already been examined in private 5 and the amount and<br>tendency of their evidence has not been allowed to transpire.<p>Dobie. and Thomson still remain in the Lock-up-house.<br>Macgaret Paterson was never married. She had one illegitimate<br>child which is dead<p>ADDITIONAL PARTICULARS, &c. <br>When they got to Gutterdike, the two ' monsters' suddenly seined<br>on, and 'threw' Margaret Paterson out of the cart; and then dangged<br>her into the field. On examining her body after death, several black<br>marks were found on one of her sides, which might have been occa-<br>sioned by a fall, bat which, from their form, are supposed to have<br>been caused by the infliction of blows from some heavy and blunt<br>weapon, such as a carter's rack pin, or wrench.<p>One of the accounts is, that, when the monsters dragged their<br>victim into the field at Gutterdike, their horses, which were left.<br>waiting, during the commission of the crime, set off for home without<br>their drivers, and on arriving without them, the 'women folk' turned<br>out to look for the men, whom they found to be missing.<p>They found some articles stained with blood in the bottom of the<br>cart, and becoming alarmed, went on the road towards Edinburgh to<br>look for the men. After proceeding a little way they saw two men<br>at a distance, who ran off on perceiving the women :? and on advan-<br>cing a little farther, they heard the groans of poor Margaret Paterson,<br>and procured assistance.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<p>Margaret Paterson, it seems, was robbed of 3s. 6d. in money, and<br>several pawn tickets, as well as ravished and murdered.<p>Forbes & Owen Printer No.148,High Street, First Stair in the Close.<br></p>
