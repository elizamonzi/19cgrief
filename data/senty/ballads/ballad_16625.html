	<h2>Transcription</h2>
	<p> An account of a bloody murder commited on the body of Mary<br>Grier above the Cross glasgow,  upon Monday Novr. 8th 1790<br>by John Henderson her own husband.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>IT is lamentable to  hear of the cruelties committed of late in this Kindom, and especially<br>in Glasgow and its neighbourhood, as no less than three cruel murders have been com-<br>mitted&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;in this vicinity&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;within  these twelve&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;months, and it is not above three weeks since<br>DAY was executed here for one of these murders.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Yet such is the depravity of the times,<br>that these awful warnings have no effect to deter wicked and hardened men in sin, from com-<br>mitting the horrid  purposes of their wicked and detestable hearts, a murderer is certainly the<br>most detestable character in society ; and another is now added to the black list which was too<br>full  before.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;John Henderson, Smith, who lived in the Fiddlers closs, high street Glasgow,<br>and wrought with a creditable master in the foot of the Grammar-school  wind.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The said<br>John Henderson had some time ago married a woman of the name of Grier to whom it seems<br>he has proved a cruel husband, for he had been privately married to another woman before<br>he married her, with whom he several times went away and left his lawful wife many were the<br>acts of barbarity which he committed upon his said wife, by beating and abusing her, insomuch<br>that her father and mother had to take her away from him several times to prevent bad con-<br>sequences.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; O ! that every cruel hard hearted wretch may take a warning from the&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;fatal<br>consequences which this treatment produced, for last week she had to be taken from him to<br>her father's house, and Monday last the 8th of November&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1790 She being far advanced in<br>her pregnancy attempted to go home in order  to prepare for her inlying but when she went<br>home he behaved in a more cruel manner than ever, he took the cheese which was prepared<br>for the inlying,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and put it on the fire until it was burnt black,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;threatning if she offered to<br>speak or take it away he would put her in the same place and roast her as black,  he then<br>poured whisky down her throat against her will, and&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;otherwise abused her in  a shocking<br>manner : and when her mother came in she found him thursting his two hand&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;in&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;her sides<br>with all his force, and swearing he would squeese the child out of her, she then fainted a way,<br>and when the neighbours were bringing a litte water to give her he push'd&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;it out of their<br>hands and would not allow them to give her any ; in this situation her mother  then  cal-<br>led assistance and took her away from him, he followed them home and swore he would burn<br>the house about them all if he did not get her back along with him, which made her father<br>apply for a warrant and put him in the tolbooth upon Tuesday, and upon Thursday morning<br>his wife died in great agony of the bruises she got from him; the steads of his hand remain<br>in her sides where he forced in his hands, he still remains in jail, and it is hoped he will meet<br>with the reward due to his enormous crime, in the mean time, must shock the hardest heart<br>to read such a cruel narrative, when the woman was in a condition that merited the tenderest<br>usage and the greatest encouragement to enable her to go through the  peril of child-birth,<br>to be used in such a cruel manner by her own husband, as to send her and the child along<br>with her unto an untimely grave; may God of his infinite mercy grant, that few Instances of<br>this cruelty may be found in our land.</p>
