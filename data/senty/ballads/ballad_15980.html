	<p> Life in Edinburgh!<p>A full, true and particular account of the narrow<br>escape of a Gentleman from a Den the Grass-<br>market, who was nearly Burked by a crew of<br>noted characters, well known in this city, he hav-<br>ing been seized by the throat by a man and a<br>number of women, who, after losing his coat-<br>tails, and being severely wounded, with difficulty<br>made his escape.?(Told by Himself.)<p>I, W. R--------n, was sorely abused, taken in, and<br>very nearly Burked, last week, by a gang of Thim-<br>blemen, Tinkers, Cadgers, Lazy Craftsmen, Petty<br>Chapmen, with other characters very like Resur-<br>rection Men, &c. Having got a little of the ' nappie,'<br>and being on a cruize down the Grassmarket, I<br>met a group of strange personages at a certain close<br>mouth, which leads to a well known den. Making<br>a stand there, I was eagerly gripped by a female?<br>taken up the close, where three fellows, very like<br>pickpockets, soon followed after, and rushed into<br>my company. I soon found where I was, and<br>on taking a thought, I attempted to get out of the<br>den, but was stopt by a blade with a cork leg. I<br>fortunately took the feet from him, and left him<br>on the floor. I was then seized by a carved faced<br>randy, who tore the tails from my coat. I got out?<br>took to my heels?and very narrowly escaped.<p>This adventure ought to be a warning to flats<br>like myself, to go home in good hours, and speedily<br>join the ' Temperate Society.'<p>In Edinburgh city there's one does live,<br>A curious blade he seems to prove?<br>A furious neighbour?here he is,<br>And scarcely worthy of hie place.<br>In the Grassmarket he has his rook<br>In A....'s close, in a hidden nook,;<br>A' kinds of folk he does take in,<br>Makes muckle siller?O horrid din.<br>Whores and thieves, and jolly beggars,<br>Packmen and tinkers around him stagger<br>And gi'es him siller each day to plank,<br>I daresay in the devil's bank.<br>He has beds from twopence to a shilling,<br>It was a curious plan made by a villain ;<br>To get his living frae poor folk,<br>The shaver thinks he is nae joke.<br>He had a wife, a regular randy,<br>Who did like whisky, rum and brandy ;<br>.  She cut her stick wi' a thimbleman,<br>For sake of drink it was her plan.<br>There is many a one comes to his house,<br>Wha thinks they are o' muckle use,<br>That's perfect blackguards like himsel',<br>And on the very road to hell.<br>This while he has been very thrang,<br>And made a purse baith braid and lang;<br>He has bought a house in the West Port,<br>Where Burk and Hare used to resort.<br>Good people, keep frae yon rough den,<br>In case that you be taken in.<br>The owner of it has been a foe<br>To many decent man, you know,<br>He was confederate to Burk and Hare,<br>His countrymen he loved dear;<br>Burk's death gave him muckle grief,<br>Since that he has scarcely got relief.<br>His laird he is a drunken chieftain,<br>Wi drink be is very often  ristin';<br>The tenant gi'es him oft a glass<br>Of whisky o' the very best.<br>There was a man they say was killed,<br>With pish and liquor so distilled ;<br>But now since syne its turned out<br>That cork-leg done the deed's, nae doubt.<br>It was proved just immediately after,<br>Which to many was great laughter,<br>To think a cripple soul would do it,<br>Perhaps he surely yet may rue it.<br>He wears a white hat on his  head,<br>He does not set it weel Indeed ;<br>A dandy coat o' bottle green.<br>Upon the blade is often seen.<br>My friends be erer on your guard,<br>O' yon hangman looking  soul mislear'd,<br>In case ye wander there at night,<br>And never see the morning light.<p>Edinburgh :-Printed for W.
