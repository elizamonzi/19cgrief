	<p> Trial and Sentence.<p>A Full and Particular Account of the Trial and Sen<br>tence of JAMES CAMPBELL, who is to be<br>Executed, at Edinburgh, on Wednesday the 19th<br>January 1825, for Assault and Robbery, in broad<br>day light in Nicolson Street in Edinburgh on the<br>17th of August last.<p>AT Edinburgh, on Monday the 13th December, 1824, JAMBS<br>CAMPBELL was placed at the bar of the High Court of<br>Justiciary, charged with assaulting Mr John Hcrner, in Nicolson<br>Street, on the 17th of August, in broad day, and then and there<br>robbing him of a Gold Watch-chain, two Seals, and Watch-Key.<br>The prisoner pleaded Guilty of the robbery, but he was unconsious<br>of having struck Mr Morner.<p>The Lord Justice Clerk, in warning the unfortunate young man<br>of the situation in which he stood, alluded to the commutation of<br>punishment of the punishment; of the men who were to have suf-<br>fered death on Wednesday next, which was not, he said, to drawn<br>into a precedent.<p>The Solicitor General said, the case was one of such a nature<br>that he could not restrict the libel; at the same rime, the Learned<br>Gentleman, with candour that does him the highest honour, put it<br>to the Counsel for the prisoner, to produce what evidence they<br>could as to his character up to the time of committing the crimes<br>with, which he stood charged. No such evidence however was<br>adduced.<p>The prisoner was overwhelmned with grief, but declined altering<br>bis plea.<p>Lord Hermand proposed that sentence of death should be passed<br>upon the unhappy man, in which Lord Pitmilly concurred, the<br>Court, as his Lordship remarked, havirig no discretionary power in<br>such a case.<p>Lord Meadowbank made some forcible observations on the<br>aggravated nature of the crime the prisoner had committed, and<br>observed,, that the safty of the lieges required that example should<br>be made ; the duty was imperious on the Court, and it was ne-<br>cessary thot on other principle should be allowed.<p>The Lord Justice Clerk then addressed the prisoner on the<br>henious nature of  his crimes, committed at half-past 12 o'clock at<br>noon on a public street;. as to the qualification of  his plea, that to<br>his knowledge he did not strike, his Lordship was at a loss to com-<br>prehend what benefit to expect to derive from that. The present<br>was a most aggravated case of street robbery, committed in the<br>heart of this populous city, and it was the imperative duty of the<br>Court to pass the last dreadful sentence of the law His Lordship<br>cautioned the unhappy man to indulge no vain hopes of a miti-<br>gation of his sentence, as had taken place in the case of the un-<br>happy persons he had before alluded to, the applications in whose<br>behalf he was not at liberty to state, and of whose commutation of<br>punishment he had only received official information that morning<br>His Lordship most feelingly addressed the wretched culprit, ad-<br>monishing him, that as his days are numbered, fixed, and deter-<br>mined, not to waste the time allotted to him, by indulging vain<br>hopes of mercy in this life, but to be earnest and anxious to make<br>his peace with his offended God by sincere repentance, through the<br>mediation of his Blessed Redeemer, in which he would be assisted<br>by the Ministers of Religion of this city. His Lordship conclud-<br>ed a most pathetic exhortation with the awful sentence?that the<br>prisoner should be executed on Wednesday morning the 19th of<br>January next, at the usual time and place.<p>The prisoner was deeply -affected, and during his Lordship's<br>address sobbed aloud, but became more composed on leaving<br>the bar.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Edinburgh...Printed for James M'Lean,....Price One Penny.</p>
