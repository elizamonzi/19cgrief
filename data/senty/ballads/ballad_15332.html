	<p> Life in Edinburgh!<p>Milling Extraordinary!<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>Betwixt GeorgE WeiR, the Aberdeen Cham-<br>pion, and McDonald, the Royal Exchange, Edin-<br>burgh, Hero, on Friday llth Nov. 1825, at Night!<p>WE have had the pleasure of at last witnessing the above<br>fight, and such a set-to was never before seen here ; nor<br>do we recollect of having ever twigg'd such a brace of rum coves<br>before. The Broad-brimmer of the Aberdeenonian, when daffed,<br>presented his finely formed nose, and it was quite easy to perceive<br>how inveterately he clenched his Ivories within his Potatoe trap !<br>On the other hand, our Hero took care of No. 1, spoke little, such<br>as take care, Sir, Now, Sir, &c. It is probably well known to our<br>readers, that the above celebrated Pugilists intended, on a former<br>occasion, to Doff their Toggery in honour of their respective<br>Cities; but the Hero having shy'd, paid forfeit. It was at the<br>discussing of the forfeit that the present match was got up, and<br>which arose out of the following circumstance :-During the<br>quaffing of the Blue, Geordy thought proper to dub Mac a Coward !<br>and  a  B-----r!  was this to be pocketed ?&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;surely  not.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sandy,<br>gave the challenge, it was accepted by Weir ! who articulated my<br>soul's in arms and eager for the fray ! and, instanter, peeled, but the<br>Gas Crib was no go. The Office was given to the different wet lods<br>present, and to Writer's Court was the cry. At ten minutes<br>past seven the men entered the Ring, attended by their respective<br>Seconds, (but we forbear at present mentioning names) it may<br>however be noticed, that the exertions of the Stakeholder was beyond<br>all praise, having been employed on the look out, making things<br>right, keeping the Beaks in Gammon, &c. he was just in time to<br>see this celebrated<p>BATTLE.<p>Round first-The men entered the ring, as was said before, at ten<br>minutes past seven, and were handled by no mean Novices in the<br>Art, and immediately set to, shaking of hands not being con-<br>sidered at all necessary by the Gentlemen, on the present occasion.<br>Weir  went up to his man, determined on mischief, and<br>nothing else, let fly right and left, and caught Sandy such a<br>smack over the right ogle, that made him kiss the sod as if defunct.<br>Loud shouts from the Stonehaven men, its all your own way Geordy,<br>and not yet, from Mac's Cowgate supporters.-Betting six gills to<br>three on Weir.<p>Round Second....Mac came to the scratch undismayed, and<br>cries of tip him one of your squeekers, Sandy, it's a fine day,<br>Mac, and such like blarney, were now repeatedly vociferated !<br>Mac himself, with his usual coolness, roaring 'go on, Sir! Now,<br>Sir,' instantly felt with his right mauly for Geordy's left sky-light,<br>and in a twinkling the  Aberdeen Youth was totally invisible !<br>he having gone through one of Dr Milner's cellar doors. It was<br>thought by some of the blades he had gone for a pill or a plaister;<br>but his friends were not down! Roars of laughter, and cries of<br>Go it, Sandy, you have done his goose for him, &c.....Betting<br>even.<p>Third, and Last, Round....Weir, still game, showed fight,<br>and would not be denied, went in, to finish off hand ; but Mac<br>instantly tapt Geordy's claret. At this moment a row began....<br>the Beaks were on the alert....Mac made himself scarce...and<br>poor Stonehive was dragged to RobertsoN's Lodgings, Old Fish-<br>market Close, opposite the Cross !!!<p>Though this Match terminated so unsatisfactorily, the Fancy<br>confidently expect another very soon.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  X, Y, Z.<p>Edinburgh:-Printed for James  McLean,-Price One Penny.</p>
