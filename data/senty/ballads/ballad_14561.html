	<h2>Transcription</h2>
	<p> Extraordinary Case !<p>A Full and Wonderful Narrative of the Extraordinary Suffer-<p>ings of Mrs JANE TOMKINSON, who fell into a Trance,<br>and was buried alive, a short time ago, in this vicinity?her<br>observations and feelings?her extraordinary escape from the<br>Grave?her wonderful recovery in the Dissecting-Room,  in<br>consequence of a galvanic experiment, and happy return to her<br>family and friends.--All as related by Herself.<p>" ONE day towards the evening, the crisis took place, I was seized with a<br>strange and indiscribable quivering. A rushing sound was in my ears?I saw<br>arround me innumerable strange faces?they were bright and visionary, and<br>without bodies, and I tried to move, but could not. For a short time a terrible<br>confusion overwhelmed me; and when it went off, all my recollection returned<br>with the most perfect distinctness, but the power of motion departed. I heard<br>the sound of weeping at my pillow, and I heard the voice of my nurse say?<br>" She is dead." I cannot describe what I felt at these words. I exerted my ut-<br>most power of volition to stir, but could not move even an eye-lid. After a<br>short pause, my friend drew near, and sobbing and convulsed with grief, drew<br>her hand over my face, and shut my eyes. The world was darkened, but still<br>I could hear, feel and suffer. When my eyes were closed, I heard by the atten-<br>dants, that my friends had left the room, and I soon found the undertakers were<br>preparing to habit me in the garments of the grave, Their thoughtlessness was<br>more awful than the grief of my friends. They laughed at one another as they<br>turned me from side to side, and treated what they believed to be a corpse, with<br>most appalling ribaldry. The coffin was procured?I was lifted and laid in?<br>my friend placed my head on what was deemed its last pillow, and I felt her<br>tears drop on my face. I was then left alone, every one shunned the room. I<br>knew, however, that I was not buried ; and though darkened and motionless, I<br> had still hope ; but this was not permitted long. The day of interment arrived<br>__I felt the coffin lifted and borne away?I heard and felt it placed in the hearse.<br>There  was a crowd of people around it: some of them spoke sorrowfully of me.<br>The hearse began to move. I knew it carried me to the grave. It halted, and<br>the coffin was taken cut; I felt myself carried on the choulders of men, by the<br>inequality of the motion. I was laid in the vault. Some short time after some<br>persons came near, and began to break up the coffin. Can it be possible, I<br>thought, that my friends suspect they have buried me too soon ? The hope was<br>truly like light bursting through the gloom of death. I felt the hands of some<br>dreadful being working about my throat. They dragged me out of the coffin<br>by the head. I felt again the living air, it was piercingly cold ; and I was car-<br>ried swiftly away. When borne to some distance, I was thrown down like a<br>clod, it was not upon the ground. A moment after I felt myself on a carriage ;<br>and by the interchange of two or three sentences. I discovered I was in the<br>hands of those robbers who live by plundering the graves, and selling the bodies<br>of parents, children and friends.<p>" One of them sung catches and scraps of songs, as the cart rattled over the<br>streets. By the conversation of the two fellows, I learned then I was that night<br>to be dissected : they were pleased to find that so good a subject had been procured.<p>" Previous to beginning the dissection, it was proposed to try on me some gal-<br>vanic experiments, and an apparatus was arranged for that purpose. The first<br>shock vibrated through rny nerves ; they tunged and jingled like the strings of<br>a harp. The students expressed their admiration at the convulsive effect. The<br>second shock threw my eyes open, and the first person I saw was the very doctor<br>who attended me. But still I was as dead ; I could, however, discover among<br>the students, the faces of many with whom I was familiar : and when my eyes <br>12:47 AM 1/24/04were open, I heard my name pronounced by several of the students with an ac-<br>cent of awe and compassion, and a wish that it had been some other subject.<br>When they had satisfied themselves with the galvanic phenomena, the adminis-<br>trator took the knife and pierced me on the bosom with the point. I felt a<br>dreadful cracking, as it were, throughout my whole frame, a convulsive shud-<br>dering followed, and a shriek of horror arose from ail present. The ice of<br>death was broken up?my trance was ended.<p>" Notwithstanding the trials I had undergone, I found myself sufficiently strong to<br>rise on my seat upon the table. Many of the students left the room precipitately; the<br>demonstrator, with several others remained, watching, with the most profound attention,<br>every movement I made. The power of speech had not yet returned, and efforts to speak<br>were unavailing.?Conscious of the indelicacy of my situation, being surrounded with<br>men, and being only partly covered with my shroud, I got off the table, and walked to- <br>wards the door, in hopes of meeting some female who might procure a decent covering.<br>The students followed in silent amazement. I passed down a long lobby, and entered an<br>apartment at the farther extremity, where some person was in bed ; I approached and<br>drew the curtain ; at this moment I found myself again able to speak, and I implored the<br>person, who proved to be a male servant of the house, to conduct me to a room where I<br>might find the company of a woman, but the person was so petrefied by fear as to be un-<br>able to answer; the demonstrator and the students, however, were in a body behind me<br>and in a few minutes every necessary was procured, and the utmost exertions were made<br>fully to restore me. ?In the course of an hour 1 was again in the bosom of my family."<br>Edinburgh:....Printed for James Mathewson,?
