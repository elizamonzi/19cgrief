	<p> Execution.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<p>An account of the Behaviour and Execution of ANDREW STEW-<br>ART and EDWARD KELLY, who were both Executed at<br>Glasgow on Wednesday Morning, in the presence of an immense<br>multitude, for the daring crime of Street Robbery. Likewise, a<br>list of all the Criminals who have been executed in Glasgow for<br>the last 60 years.<p>GLSSGOW, NOVEMBER 1, 1826.?This day the highest punishment of the law was<br>put in force upon ANDREW STEWART and EDWARD KELLY, convicted at our last<br>Circuit Court of Street Robbery.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  <p>Stewart was convicted of having, along with several others, in the beginning of August<br>last, knocked down and robbed in the Gallowgate, an Italian of the name of Filippo Testi,<br>of a gold repeater watch, with chain, seals, and key attached, two one-pound notes, and <br>guinea one, 10 or 12 shilling's in silver, a pair of black kid gloves, some tobacco, with fives<br>or six segars in a segar holder. It appears that the poor foreigner had been betrayed by a<br>woman of the town, who, gave information to a gang of ruffians that he had moony upon<br>him. After he had been knocked down, the villains were so numerous that they frighten-<br>ed away every person who wished to interfere, and actually kept rifling him for several mi-<br>nutes, and under the eyes of several spectators, till the police came up, when they ran off<br>to the Green, ami disputed about the division of the spoil, till a battle had nearly ensued.<p>Stewart was about 25 years of age, and was born in Belfast of Protestant parents, and was<br>by trade a weaver; he and his parents have resided for a long time in Bridgeton; he was ne-<br>ver known to have been guilty of any violation of the laws, till the act for what he has this<br>morning atoned with his life  leaving an aged father and mother to lament the consequent<br>ces of his thus stepping aside from the paths of moral rectitude. He was assisted in his<br>devosons by the Rev, Mr. Morrison, the Chaplain of the Prison, and the Rev. Mr. Mar-<br>shall, to whose pious advice he paid the greatest attention . He indulged  in hopes of par-<br>don almost till the last day of his life, but  the proper authorities considered that the crime<br>demanded that an example should be made. and the law was ordered to take its course.<p>Kelly was convicted along with Thomas White (but who has since been respited.) of rob-<br>bing James Fleming of upwards of L. 100 sterling,  in the Bridgegate, on the 31st March<br>last.  The circumstances of this case are nearly similar to the last, and should be a warning<br>to people who have money on them, to be are of the company they go into, for it appears<br>that Mr. Fleming had imprudently allowed himself to be decoyed into a house with a  wo-<br>man whom he had picked up in the street and while in his company she had no doubt di-<br>covered that he  had money in his possession, and after parting, had given information to<br>some of her abandoned associates, for he was soon after waylaid by several fellows, drag-<br>ged into a close and robbed of his money, and considerably hurt.  The robbers having gone<br>into, a Mr. Moffat's, spirit-dealer, Tradeston, to Divide their booty, he, by his prudent con-<br>duct had them apprehanded before they could get their purpose accomplished, and L.61 of<br>the money recovered, another of the party having made his escape with the remainder.<p>Kelly was about 21 years of age, and was also a native of the sister island, of the Roman<br>Catholic persuasion. He had never been bred to any regular business, and in consequence<br>of his idle life,  he had more than once been the inmate of a prison, He was attended by<br>the Rev. Mr. Scott and the Rev. Mr. Murdoch to whose spiritual admonitions he paid the <br>most implicit obedience.<p>Soon after 8 o'clock the culprits ascended the fatal platform, attended by the<br>Ministers of their respective religion, and after a short time spent in prayer, the executioner<br>procerded  to adjust the sopes which having been finished, the drop soon after fell, where<br>they died almost instantly. Considering the early hour the Crowd was very.considerable <p>It appears from authentic records, that since the year 1765 till the present time, where<br>embraces period of 61 years, there has been publicly executed in the City of Glasgow, &<br>criminals of which number there were executed betwixt 1765 and 1781 at the  Howgate-<br>head, where the Monkland Canal Basin now is, 7; in the Castle yard, where the Infirnary<br>now stands, betwixt 1784 and 1813, 12; at the Cross, betwixt 1788 and 1813, 22; and <br>since 1814 till this period, there have been executed in  front of the new prison, no less than <br>41 individuals!<p>In the year l769 Andrew Marshal, for murder, was hung in chains at the Howgatehead, <br>as a striking mark of public infamy..&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <p>John Muir, printer, Glasgow.<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
