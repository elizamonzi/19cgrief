	<p> The SECOND PART<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>Of the Last SPEECH, Confession and dying Words of JAMES DICK, who was<br>executed at Glasgow on Wednesday the 16th of May 1792,. and his Body given to the<br>Professor of Anatomy to be dissected, For the horrid and cruel murder of his own Wife<br>-----To which, is added, An account of his behaviour in Prison, and on the Scaffold.*<p><br>Her and me continued at our work  doing<br>middling well till the 3oth of October 1791,<br>that this melancholy affair happened.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We took<br>our breakfast together that morning as lovingly<br>as any two could do in the world ; after break-<br>fast an acquaintance called upon me and we drank<br>three or four half mutchkins of whisky together,<br>and between one and two he asked men to go out with<br>him, which I did, fore againft my wift's will, we<br>fell in with some more acquaintances and got a<br>great deal of drink.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I returned to my house in<br>the evening much the worse of liquor, and to<br>the best of my remembrance my wife was not at<br>home; I was either in bed or going to bed when<br>this melancholy affair happened, I do not mind<br>of any words that we had, I went home with no<br>evil in my heart against her, and I declare I did<br>not know any thing was wrong till I saw her lying<br>on the floor.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My next door neighbour came to<br>the door, which I opened as soon as possible, and<br>she went and looked at my wife and said she was<br>gone, she opened her breast and I saw the stab of<br>a knife in one of her breasts, I then soon turned<br>sober and thought what would be the consequnce,<br>but never thought of flying ; so I was apprehend-<br>ed by James Foyer and a party of soldiers and<br>committed to the cells all night, next day I was<br>brought before Mr. Orr, Justice of the Peace,<br>where I made a declaration of what I thought<br>could be the reason of it,- but it did me no good.<br>All you who hear or see of me, take warning and<br>guard against drinking, for had we not been both<br>drunk this dismal affair had not  happened, for<br>when people are the worse of drink they do not<br>know what they are doing, and things will hap-<br>pen that you will never get the better of.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And<br>you married women, take care and keep your-<br>selves sober, for when you are, the worse of drink<br>you do not know what you are doing, and every<br>body makes a prey of you, and you ruin yourself<br>and family, and drives your husbands into despair<br>that they  do  not care what becomes of them.<br>And you husbands, go not astray from your&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>wives, but nourish and cherish them as your own<br>souls, and show a good patron before your wives<br>and  families, and seek the Lord to guide you,<br>and every thing that is good will attend you; I<br>reflect greatly on taking my wife's life, but it was<br>through, drink and despair, for I did not know<br>what I was doing, and I hope the Lord will for-<br>give me for this along with the rest of my crimes;<br>for had I my life to begin again I would not carry<br>on the life that I have done; and all who see or<br>hear of me, do not as I have done for the regard<br>you have to yourselves and the good of your<br>own souls, for if you are cut off in the midst of your<br>sins, consider what danger you are in ; I thank<br>God, that he did not cut me off in the midst<br>of my sins, but brought me into a place where I<br>have got my eyes opened, and has given me a<br>sight of my sins, and time to repent of my folly,<br>for before this happened I could not be condem-<br>ned by man, yet I was condemned before God,<br>though I took little thought about it till now,<br>but now I see myself condemned both before God<br>and man, All you sabbath breakers, swearers,<br>drunkards and the like, turn from your ways<br>before it be too late. Woe, woe, to the cursed<br>drink, for it has ruined me, for when I saw my<br>wife lying on the floor, I would have given all<br>the world to have heard her speak again, but<br>[] the deed was done, and I justly suffer, but<p>since I was condemned it has given me great un-<br>easiness to think what has become of her poor<br>soul, for she had not time to say, God have<br>mercy on her. When I went to my trial I took<br>little or no thought about it for I thought there<br>was no proof against me, and when condemned<br>I was the same, and said they could do no more<br>to me, and though I was condemned by man I<br>hoped I was not condemned by God, and took<br>little or no thought for two or three days, when<br>Mr. M'Kay came to see how I was, by that time<br>I was taking thought of what a heinous sinner I<br>was, and could speak to no person for crying,<br>and the thoughts of my wife made my heart bleed,<br>and I told him that it was not the death that I had<br>to die that I was afraid of, but it was an angry<br>God that I had to face, he told me he was not<br>an angry God but a gracious and merciful God,<br>and showed me several chapters of the Bible, but<br>I took little thought of them till it pleased the<br>Lord to send an old comerade out of Edinburgh<br>to converse with me, for he could not get rest,<br>when he heard I was condemned, till he see'd me,<br>and he staid with me opening up the scriptures,<br>in which I took great delight. And though till<br>lately I could not have been condemned by the<br>laws of man, I see myself a long breaker of the <br>law of God, as it requires perfect love to God<br>and our neighbour, Mat. xxii. 37,39. I see my-<br>self to have been an awful transgressor of both<br>these commandments, and all my sins appear to <br>me very dark and dismal and now very evil in<br>my fight. While him and we were conversing<br>together, I was very dull thinking of my sins<br>that I could hardly speak to him, and he said<br>what I was working for, I told him for my sins,<br>he replied, that work is already done, it is fi-<br>nished by Jesus Christ, and whosoever believeth<br>this shall be saved, for proof of this he marked,<br>down many passages of scripture, and desired me<br>to mind God's word and not man's. Even when<br>I first heard this I was somewhat eased in my<br>mind, but after examining the scriptures, I found<br>it to be just and true, I was so much eased of<br>that burden at my heart, that I was almost new<br>life to me; now I rejoice when I find it written<br>John iii. 16. That God so loved the world, that he<br>gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth<br>in him should have everlasting life, and I account it<br>a faithful saying and worthy of all acceptation, that<br>Christ Jesus came into the world to save sinners of<br>whom I am the chief, so I see that God gave his <br>Son freely to die for our sins, because there was<br>no other ransome could satisfy his justice and<br>sore provoked anger; so  vile were we and full<br>of sin, that it was necessary that God himself<br>should be manifested in the flesh, being born of a<br>virgin, and by his death on the cross suffer for<br>us, see Isaiah Iiii. and in John chap xix. we have<br>an account of his sufferings far beyond my power<br>to describe, in particular at the 30th ver. when<br>Jesus had received the viniger, he said it is finish-<br>ed, and bowed his head and gave up the ghost. Now<br>it was from this very word that I at first took<br>all my joy, for I am assured that he hath com-<br>pleated all salvation for the guilty, and God hath<br>confirmed this by raising him from the dead and <br>committing unto him all judgement; I am also<br>assured that whosoever believeth on him shall<br>never perish, and therefor, though I am a great<br>sinner, I acknowledge myself to be one of the<br>chief of sinners, yet I find I have no room forThe SECOND PART<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>Of the Last SPEECH, Confession and dying Words of JAMES DICK, who was<br>executed at Glasgow on Wednesday the 16th of May 1792,. and his Body given to the<br>Professor of Anatomy to be dissected, For the horrid and cruel murder of his own Wife<br>-----To which, is added, An account of his behaviour in Prison, and on the Scaffold.*<p><br>Her and me continued at our work  doing<br>middling well till the 3oth of October 1791,<br>that this melancholy affair happened.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We took<br>our breakfast together that morning as lovingly<br>as any two could do in the world ; after break-<br>fast an acquaintance called upon me and we drank<br>three or four half mutchkins of whisky together,<br>and between one and two he asked men to go out with<br>him, which I did, fore againft my wift's will, we<br>fell in with some more acquaintances and got a<br>great deal of drink.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I returned to my house in<br>the evening much the worse of liquor, and to<br>the best of my remembrance my wife was not at<br>home; I was either in bed or going to bed when<br>this melancholy affair happened, I do not mind<br>of any words that we had, I went home with no<br>evil in my heart against her, and I declare I did<br>not know any thing was wrong till I saw her lying<br>on the floor.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My next door neighbour came to<br>the door, which I opened as soon as possible, and<br>she went and looked at my wife and said she was<br>gone, she opened her breast and I saw the stab of<br>a knife in one of her breasts, I then soon turned<br>sober and thought what would be the consequnce,<br>but never thought of flying ; so I was apprehend-<br>ed by James Foyer and a party of soldiers and<br>committed to the cells all night, next day I was<br>brought before Mr. Orr, Justice of the Peace,<br>where I made a declaration of what I thought<br>could be the reason of it,- but it did me no good.<br>All you who hear or see of me, take warning and<br>guard against drinking, for had we not been both<br>drunk this dismal affair had not  happened, for<br>when people are the worse of drink they do not<br>know what they are doing, and things will hap-<br>pen that you will never get the better of.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And<br>you married women, take care and keep your-<br>selves sober, for when you are, the worse of drink<br>you do not know what you are doing, and every<br>body makes a prey of you, and you ruin yourself<br>and family, and drives your husbands into despair<br>that they  do  not care what becomes of them.<br>And you husbands, go not astray from your&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>wives, but nourish and cherish them as your own<br>souls, and show a good patron before your wives<br>and  families, and seek the Lord to guide you,<br>and every thing that is good will attend you; I<br>reflect greatly on taking my wife's life, but it was<br>through, drink and despair, for I did not know<br>what I was doing, and I hope the Lord will for-<br>give me for this along with the rest of my crimes;<br>for had I my life to begin again I would not carry<br>on the life that I have done; and all who see or<br>hear of me, do not as I have done for the regard<br>you have to yourselves and the good of your<br>own souls, for if you are cut off in the midst of your<br>sins, consider what danger you are in ; I thank<br>God, that he did not cut me off in the midst<br>of my sins, but brought me into a place where I<br>have got my eyes opened, and has given me a<br>sight of my sins, and time to repent of my folly,<br>for before this happened I could not be condem-<br>ned by man, yet I was condemned before God,<br>though I took little thought about it till now,<br>but now I see myself condemned both before God<br>and man, All you sabbath breakers, swearers,<br>drunkards and the like, turn from your ways<br>before it be too late.

	<h2>Transcription</h2>
	<p> (2)<p>despair, nor am I locked up from God's grace,<br>though I ly chained in bars of iron. The scene<br>before me is solemn, I am just going to launch<br>into eternity, and to face that great and terrible<br>God against whom I have sinned, and Jesus sit-<br>ing at the right hand, who is able to save and<br>destroy, the scene will be great, the very thoughts<br>of it is so affecting, that it must long e'er now<br>have deprived me of my senses, had not God<br>who is rich in mercy opened mine eyes by his<br>word and Spirit, to see his glory as revealed in<br>the gospel, that he is the just God and the Savi-<br>our, and that even such a wretch as I is fully<br>warranted to hope in his mercy, this, and this<br>alone gives strength and consolation to my soul,<br>I go to Christ my Saviour and Lord, to his judg-<br>ment seat who died upon the cross for sinners,<br>to him I commit my cause, to him I look for sal-<br>vation; I am also encouraged to hope in the<br>mercy of God, from the many instances record-<br>ed in the scriptures of the salvation of sinners,<br>such as Mary Magdalene, Zaccheus, the jailor<br>at Philippi, and above all the thief on the cross,<br>which exactly applys to my case, that it gives me<br>great comfort. When I consider the love of<br>Christ I love him, and this leads me to call upon<br>his name, and to wish I could do any thing to<br>serve him and his people, and indeed, it is only<br>through the knowledge of him that all true love<br>arises either to God or man. When I ponder<br>in my mind what is recorded of the woman who<br>kissed the feet of Jesus and washed them with her<br>tears, and wyped them with the hair of her head,<br>and what the Lord said about this to Simon the<br>pharisee, I admire the grace of the Saviour, I<br>wish it were in my power to kiss his feet; with<br>what joy and transport could I wash them with<br>my tears and wype them with the hairs of my<br>head, but why should I say so? the blessed Jesus<br>needs none of my washing, it is I a poor poluted<br>sinner that needs to be washed, and I praise and <br>magnify his name, that he hath washed my soul<br>in his most precious blood.<p>Now this is the confession of my faith, and I<br>hope, and am persuaded, none who regard the<br>Bible will disapprove of, seeing I have received<br>so much comfort from it, and I give God's own<br>word for the truth of all that I have said; and<br>it is my earnest desire, that all who see this, may<br>examine the grounds of considence, and apply<br>this my remedy which will never fail.<p>To conclude, I die in peace with all men,<br>heartily forgiving all who have injured me, and<br>asking forgiveness from all whom I have injured.<p>I return my hearty thanks to my Advocate,<br>and Agents, for they did the utmost in their<br>power for me; also, to Mr. McKay and John<br>McDougal, for they have not used me like a<br>criminal, but like one of their own; but above<br>all, I return thanks to those who have been the<br>means, by the grace of God, in enlightening my<br>mind in the knowledge of the scriptures, I can-<br>not express what service they have done me, I<br>leave it to the Lord to recompence them, know-<br>ing that for his sake they showed me kindness;<br>and now, O Lord Jesus, I return to thee, these<br>are my last words, remember me now that thou<br>art in thy kingdom, and be merciful to me this<br>day, as thou was to the thief who called to thee<br>on the cross, and grant that my soul may be<br>with thee in Paradise, that I may be blessed in<br>the enjoyment of thee to all eternity. Amen.<p>(Signed) JAMES DICK.<br>JOHN M' DOUGAL, Inner Turn-key, witness.<p><br>His Behaviour in Prison and on the Scaffold.<p>IN the iron-room, the forenoon of the day of his execution, he was visited by a gentleman<br>who gave him suitable exhortations, after which he prayed himself, in the course of which<br>he prayed earnestly that the Lord might pardon him for shedding innocent blood. After prayer<br>he desired that a part of the 51st Psalm from the 8th to the 16th v. should be sung, after which<br>the gentlemen prayed. He was attended in the Hall and on tho Scaffold by the Revd. Mr.<br>Williamson of the Chapel of Ease here, and behaved decently as one in his unhappy situation.<p>On the Scaffold he made a long address to the Spectators, warning them to beware of bad<br>women and drunkenness, and likewise to wives not to give their husbands bad words when<br>they come home perhaps the worse of liquor. The substance of the whole being in the fore-<br>going speech.<p>After mounting the platform he continued a few minutes in a praying posture, after which<br>he dropped the signal, when he was immediately launched into eterinty  ; after hanging about<br>half an hour, he was taken down, and his body carried to the Anatomising Class in the College<br>for dissection.?He was dressed in black.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  <p>N. B. He acknowedged that he was in bed when his wife came in, and that he immediately<br>got up and snatched a knife from a stool with which he gave her the fatal stab.</p>
