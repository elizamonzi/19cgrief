	<p> THE BEGGAR MAN<p>THE BAND O' SHEARERS<br>The Bonnie Lassie's Plaidie<p>THE BEGGAR MAN.<p>There was an  old man cam'  o'er the lea,<br>Wi' mony a fine story unto me,<br>He was seeking out for charity ;<br>Will you lodge a beggar man, O?<p>The night being dark and somewhat wat ,<br>It's down by the fireside the auld man sat,<br>And cast the meal pock aff his back,<br>And aye he ranted and sang, O.<p>If I was as blythe as blythe could be,<br>As the day that I left my  ain countrie,<br>Blythe and merry would I be,<br>And I would not think it lang, O.<p>If I was as black as I am white,<br>As the snaw that lies on yonder dyke,<br>I would dress myself as beggar like<br>And awa' wi' you I'd gang, O.<p>O lassie, dear lassie, you are too young,<br>And you have na the cant o' the begging tongue,<br>O, you have na the cant o' the begging tongue,<br>And wi' me you canna gang,  O.<p>I'll bend my back and bow my knee,<br>I'll put a black patch on my e'e,<br>And for a beggar they'll tak' me,<br>And awa' wi' you I'll gang, O.<p>So syne the two made up the plot,<br>To rise twa hours before the old folk?<br>Sae gently as they slipt the lock,<br>And through the fields they ran, O.<p>Early next morning the auld folks arose,<br>They missed the auld beggar and his clothes,<br>So they missed the auld beggar and his clothes,<br>Saying there's nane o 'oor gude gear gane, O.<p>She ordered, the old man to wauken the bairn,<br>The milk for tae kirn, and the claes for tae airn,<br>The milk for tae kirn, and the claes for tae airn,<br>And tell her to come speedily ben, O.<p>He went tae the room where the dochter lay,<br>The sheets were cauld and she was away,<br>O&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;dear, O dear, the auld man did say,<br>She's awa' wi' the beggar man, O.<p>Some rode on horseback and some rode on foot,<br>For the old woman she was not fit,<br>She crippled about frae stern to hip,<br>Saying I'll ne'er lodge a beggar man again, O.<p>When three lang years were past and gane,<br>Cam' back the same beggar man again,<br>Saying, auld wife, since your courtship's gane,<br>Would you lodge a beggar man, O.<p>A beggar, a beggar, I'll ne'er lodge again,<br>I hadna a dochter but ane o' my ain,<br>And awa' wi 'a beggar man she has gane,<br>And I canna tell when or where, O.<p><p>O yonder she's coming o'er the lea,<br>Wi' mony a fine story unto thee,<br>O she's gotten a baby on her knee,<br>And anither comin' hame,O.<p> <p>Yonder she's coming o'er yon bower,<br>Wi' silks and satins, and fine flowers,<br>She held up her hand, and she blessed the day<br>That she followed the beggar man, O.<p>The Bonnie Lassie's Plaidie.<p>A butcher lad there lived in Crieff,<br>A bonnie lassie came for to buy some beef,<br>He took her in his arms and down she did fa',<br>And the wind blew the bonnie lassie's plaidy  awa'.<p>Her plaidy  awa', her plaidy  awa',<br>The wind blew the bonnie lassie's plaidy awa',<br>He took her in his arms and down she did fa',<br>The wind blew the bonnie lassie's plaidy awa'.<p>The plaidy was lost and could not be found,<br>The deil's in the plaid, its awa' wi' the wind,<br>But what shall I say to the old folks ava',<br>I daurna say the wind blew the plaidy awa'.<br>It was not long after the plaidy was lost,<br>Till the bonnie lassie grew thick in the waist,<br>And Rabbie was blamed for the hale o' it a',<br>And the wind blawing the bonnie lassie's plaidy  awa.<br>Then Rabbie was summoned to answer the session,<br>They all cried out you maun make a confession,<br>But Robbie ne'er answered them nae word ava,<br>But the wind blew the bonnie lassie's plaidy awa'.<br>The auld wife came in poor Rabbie tae accuse,<br>The ministers and elders began tae abuse,<br>Poor  Rabbie, for trying tae make one in twa,<br>But Rabbie said the wind blew the plaidy awa'.<br>The lassie was sent for tae come there hersel',<br>She looks in his face and says, ye ken how I feel,<br>And ye were the cause o't ye darna say na,<br>It was then the wind blew the plaidy awa'.<br>Rab looked in her face and gied a bit smile,<br>He says, my bonnie lassie I winna beguile,<br>The minister is here, he'll make ane o' us twa,<br>That will pay the plaidy the wind blew awa'.<br>The whisky was sent for to make things right,<br>The minister and elder they sat all night,<br>And sang before the cock began to craw,<br>The wind blew the bonnie lassie's plaidy awa'.<br>Now Rab and his lassie are hand in hand,<br>They live as contented as any in the land,<br>And when he gets fou' he minds o 'the fa',<br>And he sings the wind blew the bonnie lassie's plaidy awa'.<p>The Band&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;o'Shearers.<p>Autumn comes with heather bells,<br>And bonnie o'er thon mountain dells,<br>With yellow corn ripe, Lothian's vales<br>Were ready for the shearing.<p>CHORUS?<p>Oh, bonnie lassie will ye gang,<br>And shear with me the hale day lang?<br>Love will cheer us as we gang<br>To join yon band of shearers.<p>And if the thistles be too strong.<br>That they do hurt your lily-white hand,<br>With my keen blade I'll whang them down,<br>When we are at the shearing.<p>Oh,  rise, my love, the morning's fair,<br>No more thon rainy clouds we'll fear,<br>Hand in hand come let us steer<br>Away unto the shearing.<p>And if the neighbours us envy,<br>And say there's love between you and I,<br>So carelessly we'll pass them by<br>When we are at the shearing.<p>And when the shearing is a' dune,<br>Then we'll hae a rantin churn.<br>And some in corners makin' little din,<br>We'll forget a' the toils o' the shearing.<p>Copies can always be had at the Poet's Box, Overgate, Dundee.</p>
