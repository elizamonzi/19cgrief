	<p> Riot at Dumfries!<p>Hares Arrival.<p>A Full and Particular Account of the<br>Reception&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; of&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;WILLIAM&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;HARE,<br>one of the West Port Murderers, at<br>Dumfries, on Friday morning last, on<br>his way to Ireland !<p>This atrocious character was liberated on Thurs-<br>day evening, the 5th February, from the Calton<br>Jail, and took his seat, disguised, in the mail for<br>Portpatrick ; but having been recognized at Dum-<br>fries, a terrible riot took place in consequence.<br>The Mob having attacked the Jail wherein he had<br>taken shelter.....We copy the following paragraph<br>from the Courant of this day :<p>'? THE MURDERER&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;HARE.?We&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;mentioned in<br>our last publication, that this wretch had been ob-<br>liged to seek refuge from the fury of the populace<br>in the King's Arms Inn, Dumfries.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It appears he<br>was recognised in the following manner:  He was<br>entered from Edinburgh for Portpatrick as an out-<br>side passenger in the mail by the name of Black ;<br>and after  travelling&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;stage  or&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;two,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the guard,<br>without knowing  him, consented to allow him to<br>get inside  the  coach, as  the night was damp and<br>cold, but  he  had only got  up  one or two of the<br>steps'at the coach door, when a highly respectable<br>legal gentleman, who was&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;an&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;outside  passenger,<br>and who knew  him,  having&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;been&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;professionally<br>employed in the late case against  the ruffian, call-<br>ed  out,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'. Would  you put  a  murderer  inside ?"<br>This led  to the  discovery, and the coach had not<br>long arrived at Dumfries when the news of his in-<br>famons arrival became generally known.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A crowd<br>instantly assembled, evincing  the most determin-<br>edly hostile intentions.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For protection, the wretch<br>was locked up in the tap-room of the Inn until the<br>Porcpatrick&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;mail&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;should&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;start, which&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;is&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;usually<br>about  nine&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;o'clock&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  Until&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;that hour&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;mob<br>though  it continued to increase, many coming no<br>doubt to get a glimpse of such a notorious'charac-<br>ter, was tolerably quiet,  under an expectation that<br>he would&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;take&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;his&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;departure&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;by the  Portpatrick<br>mail.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  By nine&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;o clock,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;for  half a  mile&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;on  the<br>road, the crowd became immense<p>" The coach drew  up to  the  inn door, but for<br>Hare to have ventured out  would  have&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;been cer-<br>tain destruction, and, consequently, the coach drove<br>off without him.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It had  not proceeded far when<br>it was stopped  by the  populace,  and a most strict<br>search  was  made in  case he was concealed, even<br>the boot  was  examined.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Being disappointed, the<br>people became more enraged, and, in consequence,<br>the magistrates were seriouly alarmed for the peace<br>of the town.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As a russe, they caused a post-chaise<br>to draw up  at the front of the inn,  into which, it<br>was  stated, Hare  would proceed  on his journey.<br>They, at the same time, however, got another chaise<br>to the bottom of the yard of the inn, from whence<br>he contrived to escape unobserved from a  back<br>window and  to walk along  to the vehicle, which<br>was driven rapidly to the jail, followed by the mob,<br>who soon found out the trick.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The jail was then<br>assailed with  stones, the most of the windows of<br>the Court Room were broken, and one of the doors<br>forced.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  The police and constables,  however, suc-<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ceeded, with&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;some difficulty,  in  restoring  order,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; but the crowd  remained in&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the  street  till after<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;dark.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; During the night, the wretch was taken out<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of jail and privately conveyed on foot out of town,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;on the Carlisle  road, under an escort of police<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; officers,"  Edinburgh Evening Courant, Feb. 9, 1829,<p>PRICE ONE PENNY.</p>
