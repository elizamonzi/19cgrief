	<p> MURDER<p>A Full and Particular Account of the Life, Transactions, Con-<br>fessions, and Behaviour of MARGARET DAVIDSON, who was<br>Executed at Aberdeen, on Friday the 8th October 1830, for<br>the most atrocious and inhuman Murder of her Husband, by<br>pouring Poison down his throat while asleep, and her Body<br>afterwards given for Dissection.<p>ABERDEEN, 8th October 1830.....This day,  Margaret Davidson, who was<br>found guilty at  the last  Circuit Court of Justiciary in this city, under-<br>went the last sentence of the law for the murder of her husband, by poison.<p>This unfortunate woman may be considered one of the most wicked that ever<br>disgraced a civilized country.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It appears she  laid the plan, that plan which<br>brought her to this untimely fate, several years ago , although she had it not in<br>her power to do the deed, she was a woman of a savage nature, and deeply in-<br>volved with jealousy and revenge against her poor deluded husband; she had<br>often threatened for to take his life, although the poor man never  thought that<br>she would have put her threats in execution.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She perpetrated this crime in the<br>most treacherous manner; while he was asleep, and his mouth open, she poured<br>down his throat the deadly draught, which held him in the utmost torture, till<br>death put an end to his sufferings.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It fills the breast with the greatest horror,<br>to think how deliberately she committed the crime ; and every person of feeling<br>shudders at the bare recital.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At her trial she plead Not Guilty, with the greatest<br>confidence that she would not be convicted, but God who saw all her transac-<br>tions, brought it to light.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The evidence clearly proved that she had murdered<br>her husband.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Shortly after she received the sentence of death, she began to re-<br>flect on her wickedness, and in presence of two Clergymen,  she made  the fol-<br>lowing confession :?" I am the persen that murdered my husband, by adminis-<br>tering vitriol, which occasioned his death; it was  nothing  but jealousy which<br>caused me to commit the crime ; I had it in my heart two years ago for to mur-<br>der him, but I always thought to get some other person to do it, in order that my<br>hands might not be stained with his blood.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My sentence is just, I  deserve to<br>die for what I have done.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The temptations of the devil has been  strong in<br>me when I committed such a crime.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I  hope my fate will  prove a warning to<br>every person, particularly  women, not to follow my example, and deep from<br>jealously and revenge"<p>During her imprisonment she seemed for to be but little affected for what she<br>had done ; she was frequently waited on by different Ministers, who endea-<br>voured to bring her to a sense of her awful situation, their spiritual advices she<br>very thankfully acknowleged. She was visited by some of her relatives a few<br>days before her execution, and their parting scene was truly affecting. She<br>wrote the following letter to Mr F-----?n :?" I let you know that I am quite<br>resigned to my fate, and oh ! that you and all my acquaintance may take warn-<br>ing by me a wicked wretch, now a disgrace to my friends and relations; I have<br>been too late in taking a thought of myself; keep holy the Lord's day, and ne-<br>ver be led into any of the crimes which has proved my ruin ;?adieu, MAR-<br>GARLT DAVIDSON."<p>THE EXECUTION.<p>At an early hour on Friday morning, the unfortunate culprit was waited on<br>by two Clergymen, who had  brought her to reflect  on  her  wicked  state, and<br>to make preparations for another world ; after  spending some time in prayer,<br>the Rev.Gentlemen left her, and returned shortly after.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In a few minutes past two<br>o'clock, the Magistrates,with their proper attendants, entered the Hall, and shortly<br>afterwards proceeded to the scaffold ; a most fervent prayer being offered up in<br>her behalf, and a Psalm being sung, she then replied to the Clergymen and all<br>present, that her sentence was just, and that she richly deserved the punishment,<br>after shaking hands with every one around her, she mounted the fatal Drop ;<br>she was seen praying very earnestly for some time ; she then dropt the signal and was launched into<br>Eternity amidst an immense multitude of spectators from various parts of the country ; her body, af-<br>ter hanging about half an hour was cut down and delivered over to the Surgeons for Dissection. On<br>this melancholy creature no one seemed to be sorry for her fate, but looked on at the awful spectacle<br>with indifference, and shewed no marks of compassion.<p>Printed by Robertson and Co.....Price One Penny.</p>
