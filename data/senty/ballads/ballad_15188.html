	<h2>Transcription</h2>
	<p> A Full and Particular Account of the<br>Trial and Senetnce of WILLIAM<br>THOMSON, JAMES THMSON,<br>and JOHN, FRAM, who are to be<p>Executed at Dalkeith, on Thursday 1st<br>March, 1827, for Highway Robbery.<p>YESTERDAY, Monday, 22d January, 1827,<p> came on before the High Court of Justicary,<br>the trial of William Thomson, James Thomson,<br>and John Fram, labourers, accused of attacking and<br>assaulting, on the 30th November last, at or near<br>the foot of Langside Brae, in the parish of Dalkeith,<br>George Dickson, farmer, Cousland, who was return-<br>ing home from Dalkelth market, when they seized<br>hold of his horse ,and struck the said G. Dickson<br>several sever blows on the face, head, and breast,<br>with large wooden bludgeons, or other offencive<br>weapons, by which he was severly wounded, to the<br>great efusion of his blood ; and that they afterwards<br>robbed him of a silver hunting watch....a copy of<br>the Scotsman, and a letter addressed to Mrs Dick-<br>son, besides several memorandums.<p>George Dickson was in Dalkeith on the 30th day<br>of November,....he left it at 5 o'clock in the after-<br>noon, on horseback, quite sober. He took the di-<br>rect road by the Cow Bridge, and Langside Brae,<br>to Cousland. Thers is a plantation on the west<br>side of the brae, and on the east side there is a<br>smaller one, of about two acres. There is a small<br>burn at the bottom of the brae, near which there<br>were several piles of stones laid up for breaking.<br>He was at Langside Brae about 10 minutes past 5,<br>it was twilight; when at the foot of the brae, a<br>man started out from these stones, and took hold of<br>the reins of his horse. He had a large stick in his<br>hand, with which he made a stroke at witness. It<br>appeared to be a stick, neatly cut, having a large,<br>knot at one end. Witness gave his horse a touch<br>with his foot, upon which the animal reared, but<br>the moment he came down, another man seized<br>him on the other side. The horse reared several<br>times, witness always endeavouring to bring him. <br>above his assailants, but every time he came to his<br>feet he was seized by one of the fellows. Witness<br>received a severe blow on the side of the head ; and<br>when the horse came to his feet the last time, one<br>of the men pulled out witness's watch, (which he<br>described) and some papers, which were in his side,<br>pocket ; also a newspaper, which was in his coat<br>pocket. Witness here identified a letter and some<br>papers : and stated, that he received in all, four se-<br>vere blows upon the head. He lost a great quan-<br>tity of blood. He said that there were four men<br>in the party, and one cried twice, ' Murder the-------,<br>murder him.'&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Witness looked at the prisoners :<br>He said he knew them all by sight; they were all<br>of the party who robbed him.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Three of the four<br>men had on dark coloured clothes, and one had on a<br>red vest with stone coloured sleeves,...it was Fram<br>who was thus dressed.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It was William Thomson<br>who came forward and gave him the first blow : it<br>was Fram who cried out ' Murder him.'  A man, or<br>rather a boy (William Leslie) was brought into<br>Court, and identified as the fourth of the party. The<br>whole, or most of the party, had sticks newly cut_<p>The Lord Justice Clerk, in an address which oc-<br>cupied an hour and a half, laid before the jury the<br>whole case, as brought out in evidence.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After<br>which, the jury, without leaving the box, unaui-<br>mously found all the prisonrs guilty, but recomend-<br>ed James Thomson and John Fram to the mercy<br>of the crown.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They were then sentenced to be<br>executed on Thursday the 1st of March, at or near<br>Dalkeith, or such other place as the Sheriff should<br>fix upon.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
