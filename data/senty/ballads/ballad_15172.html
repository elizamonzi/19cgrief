	<p> Horrid Murder.<p>A Full True and Particular Account of a Cruel and<br>Dreadful MURDER, committed on the Bodies of<br>Two ORPHAN CHILDREN, by Mrs LONG,<br>their Mother-in-law, at Gainsboro', in Lincolnshire,<br>on  the 26th January, 1824, and who also attempt-<br>ed to Cut her own Throat<p>THE following surprising and solemn miracle attended with so<br>awful a judgment, will make a deep impression on the minds<br>of a discerning public. It displays the abhorrence of Divine pro-.<br>vidence, against wicked actions committed as it were in defiance of<br>Omnipotency. Numbers are astonished that; such a  wretched wo-<br>man should have existence, but more when they hear the barbarous<br>and inhuman act of cruelty she perpetrated upon Three poor Or-<br>phan Children, to inherit a large property that was left them at the<br>death of their own father, Mr Long, an independant Gentleman, at<br>Gainsbro'. When he was upon his dying bed, he sent for his<br>three lovely children, Samuel, Sarah, and Jane, all under ten years<br>of age, and begged of his wife to bring them up in the fear of God,<br>which she faithfully promised him she would do, but shortly after<br>his death she became acquainted with one Mr J. B r, a young-<br>gentleman from the country, which soon, made her forget her pro- ?<br>mises, and instead of behaving to them in a motherly manner, she<br>was always forming a plan to destroy them for the sake of their for-<br>tune, when one day she  received a note from the young gentleman.<p>A COPY OF HIS LETTER.<p>" Dear Madam,?I have taken the opportunity of writing a few<br>lines to let you know that I have been thinking of what past be-<br>tween you and me the other day, about changing our situation but<br>I can by no means think of marrying a woman with three children<br>and you say. you have no other property but what is left to them,<br>were it not for that,  I should have no objection to fulfil my pro-<br>mise, so no more at present from your sincere friend and well-<br>wisher,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; J.B----r."<p> After this wicked wretch read this letter, she begun to ill-use<br>these poor fatherless and motherles  children in an inhuman man-<br>ner, without any cause, and in a most shocking emaciated state,<br>locked them up in an old out house, determined to starve them to<br>death, reporting it about she sent them to a Boarding school in the<br>Country ; but after they had been three days and, three nights in<br>that deplorable situation, the Devil infused it into the heart of this <br>reprobate, to murder them. The hardened wretch thinking it<br>would be impossible to be discovered, she immediately seized a<br>large case knife, determined to put an end to their existance, but<br>when these poor innocent children saw the door open, they begun<br>to smile, and thought she was going to take them from that  horri-<br>ble place of confinement, where they were almost perishing to,<br>death with hunger and cold, when the wicked wretch seized two of<br>these poor innocent babes with violence, and plunged the knife in-<br>to their tender bosoms; but it is happy to relate, that the poor boy<br>made his escape, and alarmed the next door neighbours, who im-<br>mediately ran to their assistance, but too late for the two poor<br>harmless babes who were lying in gores of blood too horrid for<br>description, and when this wretched woman found that she was<br>detected, and could not have her will of the other, she cut her own<br>throat, but the surgeon was iokmediately sent for, and by his aid<br>and assistance her life was saved, and is now in custody in a most<br>dangerous situation, but is hopen she will recover, and take the aw-<br>ful and just judgment of the law, which cannot but remain a last-<br>ing warning to the world at large.<p>Edinburgh, Printed for Alexander Turnbull, price one penny.</p>
