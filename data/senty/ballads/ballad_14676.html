	<p> COPY of a very interesting LETTER from&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  <p>Botany-bay,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<p>Received in Glasgow, a few days ago, from one of the Persons<br>engaged in the unfortunate affair of Bonnymuir, giving a par-<br>ticular account of the  situation of the whole of the  people<br>who were transported for being concerned on that unhappy<br>occasion; with a description of that Colony.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  <p>THE following very interesting Letter was received a few days ago from Thomas<br>M'Culloch, Stocking-weaver, addressed to his wife in Glasgow, dated<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sydney, New South  Wales, October 12, 1821.<p>I send you these few lines, hoping they will find you and the children in good<br>health, as they leave me at present, thank God for it. We arrived here on the 18th<br>of May, all in good health (after being at sea five months). I was taken off the<br>stores, by a Mr. Panton, a native of Scotland, and employed by him as a labourers but<br>not agreeing with me, he was so kind as to transfer me to a Captain Irvine, and I am<br>to be with him as a house-servant, and I am going to remove about 40 miles up the<br>country.<p>If you think of coming here, there shall be nothing wanting on my part to bring<br>you, as I have every encouragement from several Gentlemen that can enable me to<br>do so, as your presence here will free me from bondage; as any man's wife that comes<br> here as a free settler, can take her husband from Government employment, or being<br>a servant to any of them. Captain Irvine has promised to do every thing for us to<br>make us comfortable. By your friends applying to the Secretary of State at London,<br>you could obtain for us 3 or 400 acres of land. It is Andrew Dawson's wish that his<br>wife would come here also, and we will endeavour to get you cut both together; but<br>if you do not think of coming, I hope that you and the rest of my friends will do all<br>they can to obtain a mitigation of my sentence, as my mind never can be at rest till I<br>be with you and the rest of my family.<p>Sir Thomas Brisbane arrived here two days ago; he is to be our new Governor, and<br>the Governor can pardon any man he thinks proper; a great many have obtained their<br>liberty since we arrived here; Captain Irvine, Mr. Wyeems, Commissary-General,<br>and other Gentlemen, have promised to befriend us; and the whole of our party is<br>much respected here by the most respectable people in this country, and if you will<br>only come out, a steady man and woman can do well, as they are very rare articles to<br>be found here.<p>Andrew Dawson, James Cleland, John M'Millan, and Allan Murchie, are kept in<br>Government employment, on account of their being blacksmiths, who are valuable in<br>this part of the world; W. Clarkson and John Anderson is with Mr. Lord, a respecta-<br>able Gentleman, who much esteem them; A. Johnson is principal servant to the; Com-<br>missary General; Thomas M Farlane and Thomas Pink are with the Barrack Master;<br>Jam s Wright is a shopman to a Dr. Phillips; Benjamin Moir, John Barr, and David<br>Thomson, is with Sir John Jameson; Andrew White, bookbinder; and Alex, Hart,<br>cabinet-maker, are in Paramatta with Dr. Douglas; Wm. Smith is also at Paramatta,<br>with Mr Marsden; Robt. Gray and Alex. Lattimer, is in Van Dieman's Land with<br>Mr. Mulgrave.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<p>This is a fine country, and will grow any thing that will grow in any other coun-<br>try, and in general have three crops a year. Loaf bread 3d per lb , butter 2s. per<br>lb., beef and mutton 10d., eggs 2s. a dozen, tea 2s. 6d. per lb., sugar 6d, potatoes<br>10 s. per cwt. A free labourer gets from 25s. to 30s. a-week, and a tradesman who<br>has a trade to suit this part of the country can make it a great deal better. I see<br>Gilbert M'Leod, (late printer of the " Spirit of the Union,") often?he is very well,<br>and is acting as a schoolmaster. The letter concludes with compliments to a number<br>of friends and acquaintances, and he requests to be remembered to his shopmates. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;THOMAS M'CULLOCH<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;John Muir, Printer, Glasgow.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  </p>
