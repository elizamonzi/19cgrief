	<h2>Transcription</h2>
	<p> An account of the Execution of WILLIAM  DORNAN, and ROBERT SMYTH, who were<br>banged at Air, on Friday the 26th  day of  May, pursuant to their sentence, for shopbreak-<br>ing and theft?with an account of their behaviour at the place of execution.<p>THE number of unhappy  men  that  in  the&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;pre-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>sent enlightened state  of  society forfeit their&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>lives to the injured laws of the  happy country in <br>which they  live  is  truly  deplorable ,  and  would dis-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>grace the dark ages long past.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  <p>It proves but too clearly, that religion is daily <br>more and more  neglected; and, of course, the <br>hearts of those who neglect it become wicked and <br>depraved. He who does not consider religion as <br>one of his most principal duties?a duty which <br>not only smoothens the rugged path of this tran- <br>sient life?teaches resignation to the will of that<br>Supreme Power by whom we&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;live;  move, and have <br>our being, but insures all the happiness we are per- <br>mitted to enjoy in this world, and promises, through <br>the&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;merits  of  our&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Blessed  Saviour ,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; to  every  true<br>believer, eternal life, with felicity indescribable, in <br>the world to come.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<p>  In the present eventful period, no doubt, trades-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>men in general have been much depressed; for the&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>enemy with which Britain has so long and nobly&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>contended with, after trying every effort that un-<br>bounded ambition could invent to ruin this happy&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>country without success, he at last aimed a blow at&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>our  commerce,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;attended  with  circumstances the&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>history of no nation or time can parallel, as he saw<br>by trade we were happy, rich, and content.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>the wisdom of the government  under which we&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>live, in a great measure, frustrated this diabolical  <br>scheme also; and few tradesmen that are industrious<br>can yet say they want bread.<p>The&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;tradesman who is sober and industrious,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>much as the times are complained of, can yet live&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>in a decent manner; but he who indulges himself&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>in idleness and dissipation is sure to work his own&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>destruction although trade was in the most flourish-<br>ing state.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The two unfortunate men who suffered<br>this day, Friday May 26,  1809, at Air, are ano-<br>ther lamentable proof of what has been advanced<br>on this subject; for they were both useful trades-<br>men, and by not pursuing their industry with con-<br>tentment, they were led into practices that brought<br>them to a shameful and premature death, and de-<br>prived  society for ever of that&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;assistance which<br>it was their duty to have given it.<p>They were both natives of Ireland?William<br>Dornan was by trade a blacksmith, and Robert<br>Smyth a shoe-maker. Smyth had enlisted with the<br>21st regiment, and afterwards deserted.<p>They appeared to be connected with a man of<br>the name of Cunning, a cotton spinner, from Bel-<br>fast, who was at Air the time the robbery was com-<br>mitted, and appeared at their trial as an exculpatory<br>witness. He then stated, that in September last he<br>was in Air, and on the evening of the 10th, he<br>went to the quay, and staid there till late expect-<br>ing to have got away with a vessel which did not<br>sail. He then came up to town along with another<br>man of the name of Muir, who he believed went<br>afterwards to Dublin and enlisted. When near the<br>far end of the bridge he saw Smyth and Dornan<br>listening to a quarrel. They advised him not to<br>cross the bridge, but to go round by the street to<br>avoid the bustle. When passing up the street he<br>saw two men carrying bundles. Smyth and Dor-<br>nan then run after them, and got two bundles<br>which those who had run off dropped He also<br>stated that he never touched the bundles, but im-<br>mediately left Dornan and Smyth.<p>This was also the very same manner in which<br>Dornan and Smyth said they got the goods, when<br>taken before the Magistrates, and examined respect-<br>ing the robbery, although Smyth, who was first<br>apprehended, in a public-house in Prestick, while<br>on the road to Air, and before  this examination<br>took place, admitted knowing something of the<br>goods stolen, and further, that  he was one of the<br>two who were at the shop that was entered, but<br>that he only stood at the door while Dornan hand-<br>ed out the goods. He also agreed, when brought<br>to Air, to shew the place where the goods were<br>concealed and war, seat accordingly under a guard.<br>He said on the road, that Dornan was at Irvine<br>trying to get a passage in any vessel  for Ireland, and<br>to take the goods with him, and that he would be<br>back between four and six.<p>When they came to the place where the goods<br>were hid, Dornan was discovered, who run off on<br>their coming near him, but was pursued, and then<br>taken; and the goods, in two large packages, were<br>found in Prestick Lands, by Smyth's directions.?<br>This transaction, contrasted with what was said by<br>Cunning the exculpatory evidence, but too clearly<br>evinced their guilt; indeed the Judge who presided<br>at the trial considered him as an objectionable wit-<br>nese, but the Advocate Depute having no objections<br>to him, well knowing the Jury would see the absur- <br>dity of what he advanced when they compared his<br>statement with other parts of the evidence, there-<br>fore he was permitted to give his evidence as above<br>related.<p>The articles taken from the shop, which was en-<br>tered by means of false keys, consisted principally<br>of nineteen pieces of print, five of gingham, silk<br>chambray, black silk velvet, cotton, ditto, spotted<br>muslins, imitation shawls, handkerchiefs, &c.?<br>But although the robbery was immediately adver-<br>tised, and the goods diligently searched for in every<br>suspicious quarter, no discovery [&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  ]<br>by accident, a child in a house at cloncaird, where <br>Sally M'Glauchlan, Smyth's  wife, had been en-<br>gaged as a reaper, observed a number of silk hand-<br>kerchiefs in a bundle which belonged to Sally?she<br>told her mother, and she communicated it to her<br>husband, who took the necessary steps to have<br>Sally apprehended, and her examination led to a<br>full discovery of the robbery.<p><p>The unfortunate men, from the day they were<br>condemned, conducted themselves with the most<br>pious resignation, and appeared highly sensible of<br>the  treatment and  indulgence they  experienced<br>during their confinement.<p><p>Their behaviour at the place of execution was<br>in every respect becoming their awful situation.-?<br>They appeared on the scaffold about three o'clock,<br>took an affectionate leave of the Magistrates and<br>Ministers who attended them?then addressed the<br>multitude in a firm manner, acknowledging the<br>justice of their sentence, and exhorting them to take<br>warning by their melancholy fate, which they<br>brought on themselves by neglecting their industry,<br>and indulging themselves in idleness. After they<br>finished their address they shook hands with the<br>executioner, prayed fervently about ten minutes,<br>gave the fatal signal, and were launched into eter-<br>nity in presence of the greatest concourse of people<br>ever remembered to be assembled in Air on any oc-<br>casion whatever.<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <p>Printed by Thomas Duncan, 159, Saltmarket.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
