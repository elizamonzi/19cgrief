	<p> A Full and Particular Account of that Funny and<br>Laughable WEDDING that took place in Cross-<br>causeway, Edimburgh, on Tuesday Evening, the<br>15th March 1815, between a young Dashing High-<br>land Lad, and a well known Old Lady of that place.<p>THE following' ludicrous circumstance excited an extraordinary<br>sensation in the crosscauseway and neighbourhood, on Tues-<br>day evening, the 15th March instant. It appears that a young,<br>blooming good looking lad, of the name of M'L------, a watchman<br>of' very captivating exterior, had, for a considerable period previous,<br>paid his addresses to a well known old Lady, a purifier of tripe, re-<br>siding in that place, (better known by another appelation, H----------<br>Mary, who at length yielded to his ardent and pressing suit, and<br>Tuesday was mutually fixed on for the celebration of their nuptials.<p>The fair enamorate, in order, as it would seem, to engratiate her-<br>self the more deeply into the good graces and favour of her future<br>Lord, impressed Twenty-five Sovereigns into his hands, in order,<br>she said, to make him appear very genteel on the occasion, and par-<br>ticularly to provide him with a new watch, a necessary appendage,<br>of course, to a gentleman. She also undertook to furnish a most<br>splendid marriage banquet, which was accordingly ordered, and to<br>which a gaeat number of the friends, relations and acquaintances of<br>both parties were formally invited.<p>Accordingly, at the appointed hour, the company assembled, in<br>their gayest apparel, among whom were a great many Knights of<br>the baton, in fine trim. The modest blooming bride appeared<br>among the astonished natives, dressed in eastern splendom and<br>magnificence, the very silk gown worn by her on this happy occa-<br>sion, like the Laird of Dumbiedykes' mother's gowns, would stand<br>its lane on the floor, it was so rich, and the other parts of her costly<br>dress corresponded with the gown. She continued to grace the<br>happy assemblage with her presence, for a considerable time after<br>the hour appointed, smiling sweetly to some, and courtseying mo-<br>destly to othsrs, in great good humour, of course, anxiously expect-<br>ing the arrival of her happy lover, to crown her wishes at the hymen-<br>eal altar.<p>The clergyman having arrived about this time, to which the now<br>most anxious and impatient bride was  introduced,  but there  was<br>still no word of Mr M'L-----.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The minister sat down beside the<br>bride, who encouraged her to hope, that her beloved partner would<br>soon make his appearance, and ease all her anxious doubts and fears,<br>which now became evident to the whole company. With some<br>pleasant chat. and the assistance of an occasional cordial glass now<br>and then, the reverend gentleman managed to prolong the pleasing<br>hopes of the arrival of the long expected bridegroom for several<br>hours after the time previously appointed ; but it was now become<br>pretty evident that Mr M'L------did not intend to make his appea-<br>rance at all, for he fairly absconded.<p>It appeared  that Mr M'L------had  adopted the notion, thac he<br>would exhibit his finery to much more advantage upon the Highland<br>hills, than on the streets of auld Reekie.<p>The chagrin of the disappointed bride was now awful in the ex-<br>treme but she could not still help but encourage the pleasing hope,<br>that the bewitched enchanting man would not deceive her yet.  It<br>turned out otherwise, however ; and the old lady fell into an awful<br>hysterical fit, from which a glass of gaod brandy was scarcely able<br>so recover her. At last, finding herself really abendoned, and that<br>the could not better herself, she allowed herself to be put into good<br>spirits again, by repeated applications of strong water. At her sug-<br>gestion, the party par-ook of their elegant and sumptuous supper,<br>consisting of every delicacy of the season, and the good old Lady<br>comforted herself for the loss of her false admirer, by repeated and<br>potent doses of Uisgebetha, mollified with  hot wateo and sugar,<br>after supper, the catgut scraper struck up a merry lilt, and they con-<br>tinued to trip it on the  light  fantastic toe till five o'clock in the<br>marning, when the bride went home, and she had to go to bed<br>again alone, which she reluctantly did, but still hoping that Mr<br>M'------would yet relict, and speedly return to the fond and longing<br>embrace of his dearly beloqed M??.</p>
