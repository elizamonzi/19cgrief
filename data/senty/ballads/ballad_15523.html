	<h2>Transcription</h2>
	<p> SPEECH<p>OF<p>Sir  Daniel Sandford,<p>One of the Radical Candidates for the City of Glasgow, at Camlachie, on 6th<br>December, 1832?Conduct and base Plot of the Edinburgh Whigs to stifle<br>the New-Born Liberties of Glasgow?The Radicals triumphant.<p>SIR DANIEL after some preliminary remarks, stated that he had that day<br>received a letter from Edinburgh, which informed him that the Edinburgh<br>Whigs "were giving out that they had opposed his pretensions in Glasgow,<br>because he had not consulted Lord Holland, and because the ministry were op-<br>posed to him. (Cries of "oh, oh, and laughter.") So here it appeared that the<br>Edinburgh Whigs were the great movers of the opposition to his pretensions,<br>and the small whig coterie in this city were the mere slaves of another whig<br>coterie in the metropolis?(cheers)?mere puppets who moved as the strings<br>were drawn?who raised their little arms, and followed every mavement just as<br>it was imparted to them by their Edinburgh keepers. (Much laughter.) Now<br>ne wished the electors of Glasgow to draw from this fact an important practical<br>lesson, and he would relate one or two farther particulars to place the matter be-<br>fore them in a still clearer light. He had in his pocket a letter which he had<br>received from the Edinburgh whig leader in the important month of June last,<br>when they were struggling for the security of the Reform Bill, in which that<br>leader pours forth his whole soul in gratitude to him for his exertions on that<br>occasion. There was no hostility expressed?no opposition?but all was the<br>language of eulogium and gratitude?eulogium so high, that had he required a<br>certificate, as had been found necessary by one of his brother candidates, he<br>might have laid the document just as it stood before the electors?(laughter)?<br>but he and his friends needed no certificates?their claims to notice were known<br>to every elector. Such was the language used towards him by the Edinburgh<br>whigs during the struggle. But what was it now ? O we must oppose this<br>impudent fellow, because he presumes to come forward without the sanction of<br>Lord Holland, contrary to the wishes of the ministry. (Laughter.) He would<br>ask the electors did they conceive it necessary that Lord Holland should be con-<br>sulted as to their representatives ; or that they should require the information of<br>any ministry on the subject ? (Cheers, and cries of No.) But the allegations of the<br>cabal were not true. He pledged his word of honour as a gentleman, that what he<br>said on former occasions was true - that some of the liberal ministers had ex-<br>pressed to him an anxious wish that he should be returned to Parliament; and<br>as to Lord Holland when last in London that nobleman recommended him strong-<br>ly to become a candidate for Glasgow, and offered him the whole weight of<br>the ministerial influence. He replied that he was highly obliged to him, but he<br>thought that ministerial influence would do more harm than good in Glasgow.<br>(Cheers). These stories had been trumped up by the barefaced impudent Edin-<br>burgh Whigs, and their friends, the little cabal of whigs here, for the purpose<br>of keeping up the influence of their friends here, for whom we had fought the<br>battle when they were not able to fight it for themselves ?(Cheers ) He ought<br>to apologise for keeping their attention so long to what might appear a personal<br>question, but he wished to show the electors and the people who the party were<br>in whom the people should stand most in apprehension at the present moment.<br>Glasgow could never again be a close corporation burgh, but let them take care<br>that it does not become a close party borough. (Loud cheers.) He would tell<br>them another story which showed the designs of the small coterie of whigs act-<br>ing here. He was in Edinburgh when the passing of the Reform Bill was look-<br>ed upon as certain, and was a visitor at the house of a leading Whig, when the<br>subject of who were likely to be candidates for Glasgow was started. It was<br>remarked as a thing to be hoped for that Mr Oswald would come forward. He<br>said he did not know whether he would or not, and expressed the great respect<br>he had for Mr Oswald, both on account of his private character, his consistency<br>in liberal views, and the hereditary honours he was possessed of, but expressed<br>his fears that after all, from Mr Oswald's tastes and time of life, he might not<br>make an efficient member. " O," it was replied, by one of the company, " we<br>don't want efficient members for Glasgow?we want two good votes."?They want<br>two good votes?two dead votes?and he supposed they wanted two dumb votes,<br>too. (Laughter.) He thought he might be able to show the motive for all this.<br>All the patronage and all the influence for Scotland had hitherto flowed in one<br>channel?Edinburgh ; and the Edinburgh Whigs were fearful lest Glasgow<br>should interfere with this snug preserve of their own, and therefore wished that<br>she should return only two dumb votes. He put it to the electors if they would<br>allow this free burgh?for it was now virtually free, to become a mere appendage<br>to the burgh of Edinburgh. (No, no.) This was the ground of the attempt to<br>force on the citizens two nominees by the small coterie, and all the opposition<br>made to him and to the other independent candidates. (Cheers.) If he had suc-<br>ceeded in producing a conviction in their minds that a plot had been formed to<br>stifle the new-born liberties of Glasgow, it lay with them to crush the design.<br>More than one candidate was before them free from the trammels of any cabal<br>?who were not the nominees of any party, ready to do their work, be it dirty<br>or clean, but whose whole labours would be in the service of the people. It<br>would be their own fault if they did not at this crisis send independent men to<br>Parliament in whom they could vest the destinies of the country for weal or for<br>woe ; unfettered men, who would not give dumb votes, but who would raise<br>their voices on every subject which affected the interests of the country. Sir<br>Daniel then repeated his sentiments on church establishments and the corn laws,<br>and concluded amid great applause."<p>These are the actions of men who would force and cajol the Independent<br>Electors of Edinburgh to elect a PENSIONER for our good city.</p>
