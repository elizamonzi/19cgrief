	<p> THE<p> Last&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SPEECH <p>OF<p>COLL,  OXBURGH.<p>Who was  Executed at TVBURN MAY 14th, 1716.<p>Delevered by him to the Sheriffs, and Printed at LONDON by their<br>Order.<p>Clifton has made it almost necessary for Persons in my Circum-<br>stances, to say or leave somewhat by their last Words, declaring<br>their Sentiments with Relation to what they die for: In Com-<br>plyance with which, I have thought fit to make the following<br>Declaration.<p>In the first Place, I declare I die a Member of the Holy Roman Catho-<br>lick Church, tho' a very unworthy One ; and I desire all the Members of<br>that Cmmunion, to assist my Soul with their charitable prayers.<p>I declare for my self, That I am in Charity with all the World, and<br>do from my Soul forgive all my Enemies, and all others who have any<br>Ways injured or done me Wrong And particularly, I forgive all those<br>who have promoted my Death, by malicious Misrepresentations, or other-<br>Ways : And earnestly beg GOD to forgive them, and grant them the same<br>Blessings I desire for my own Soul.<p>I likewise ask Pardon of all such as I have offended.<p>It has been said, that the Catholicks, who were taken at Preston., en-<br>gaged in that Affair in View only of setting a Catholick King on the Throne,<br>and re-establishing the Catholick Religion in England; but that is not the<br>only Calumny charged on them, I declare for my own particular, that if<br>KING JAMES the 3d had been a Protestant, I should think my self obliged<br>to pay him the same Duty, and do him the same sevice, as if a Catholick; <br>nor do I know any Catholick that is not of the same Principle : For<br>I never could find that either by the Laws of GOD, or the Ancient Con-<br>stitution of the Nation, Difference of Religion in the Prince made any Change<br>in the Allegiance of the Subject.<p>I might have hoped, from the great Character Mr. Will gave me at<br>Preston ( when I treated with him for a Surrender ) of the Clemency of<br>the Prince now on the Throne (to which he said, We could not better<br>entitle our selves than by an early Submission ) that such as Surrendered them<br>selves Prisoners at Discretion, on that Prospect, would have met with more<br>Lenity than I have Experienced ; and I believe England is the only Coun-<br>try in Europe, where Prisoners at Discretion are not understoo'd to have their<br>Lives sav'd.<p>I pray GOD of his Infinite Goodness restore the Nation to its former<br>happiness by Extinguishing all unhappy Divisions, that all Animosities<br>and Feads may be buried and and no other Emulation remain among the<br>Subjects of Great Britain, but, who shall be most  zealons, in advancing the<br>inn Glory of GOD, and the true Interest of the Nation.<p>EDINBURGH,<p>Re-printed by WILLIAM ADAM'S Junier, and sold at the Printing house<br> opposite to  the Trone Church 1716.</p>
