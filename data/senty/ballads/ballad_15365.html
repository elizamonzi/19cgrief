	<p> An ACCOUNT of<br>A most Horrid, BLOODY, and Terrible<p>APPARITION,<p>Which lately Appeared in the Parish of SHOTTS;<p>AND<p>A TRUE AND GENUINE ACCOUNT OF<p>A DISMAL AND SHOCKING MURDER,<p>In the very Words expressed by the GHOST itself,<br>as faithfully taken down by a Most Holy Person,<br>who was present at the whole<p>AT a late meeting of many industrious persons of the parish of Shotts, and who had been seduced<br>A to associate together at the instigation of one, who was enraged at not having procured a good<br>place from his Majesty, many of the company became heated by talking of subjects which even the<br>wisest do not comprehend. Under the pretence of reforming grievances, without knowing whether<br>they did exist, they begun to talk of overthrowing the government, established by GOD in this country,<br>and in its place establishing a diabolical plan, by which those who were the greatest thieves, or the most<br>atrocious murderers, would be the sole rulers of the land. They had completely forgot the holy doc-<br>trines of our Blessed Redeemer, who, by the mouths of. his Apostles, commanded us to submit our-<br>selves to every ordinance of man for the LORD'S sake, whether it be to the king as supreme, or unto<br>governors, as unto them that are sent by him for the punishment of evil-doers, and for the praise of<br>them that do well: for so is the will of GOD.?As free, and not using our liberty for a cloak of malici-<br>outness,  but as the  servants of  /ill/ Honmur all  men: Love  the  brotherhood.?Fear God: Honour<br>the king.<p>In this state of frantick madness, they were much alarmed by a hollow murmuring sound, like the<br>rolling of thunder, and which continued to increase and approach towards them, and at length ended in<br>a loud and awful yell: when the door of the room burst open, and there appeared before them a most<br>hideous spectre, with a visage as white as snow, his hair clotted with blood, and clad in a white winding-<br>sheet, so thin, that it did not conceal his body, mangled and torn in many places.?At this awful visita-<br>tion, the whole company shook from joint to joint, their hair stood on end, and heavy drops of sweat<br>poured dcwn their bodies. At length, the apparition broke silence?<p>" I am what remains of the once ROCHEFOUCAULT, a native of France: Like you, I was a reformer in that<br>country; and, after overthrowing the established government, I thought a constitution was obtained to<br>make all happy.?But, alas ! the bonds of society were thrown loose, and a desperate band of robbers and<br>renegadoes, by force acquired the ruling of the land. That they might command the multitude, they<br>destroyed all religion, and blasted the name of the Blessed JESUS, as a cheat and impostor. Those who<br>had no hope or dread of an hereafter, stopped at no crime. Robbery, murder, and assassination in cold<br>blood, became familiar to those emissaries of hell. As to their King, the Anointed of the LORD, whom<br>they had sworn to defend, in the words of the holy David, " He heard the blasphemy of the multitude,<br>" and fear was on every side, while they conspired together against him to take away his life." O, accurs-<br>ed nation of assassins !?I sought to escape from such blood-thirsty villains ; but the leaders of the party,<br>knowing that I would take no part in their infernal schemes, found me out retired with my wite and fa-<br>mily, and, in her arms, they thrust hundreds of poniards into my body; and, merciless blood-hounds<br>they tore my dear wife to pieces, with the unborn infant then in her womb. Take heed, therefore, in-<br>fatuated people, from my disastrous fate : Let it be a warning against all seditious attempts ; and remem-<br>ber, " That the powers which be, are ordained of GOD : whosoever therefore resisteth the power, resisteth<br>" the ordinance of GOD ; and they that resist, shall receive to themselves damnation."<p>With these words of St Paul, the apparition vanished in a cloud of fire ; and terrible were the feelings<br>of those who remained. At length, the holy person, who has furnished this narrative, said, Let us, on<br>our knees, pray to GOD : and, through his divine assistance, he sent forth this ejaculation?" O GoD, the<br>Father of our Lord JESUS Christ, out only Saviour, the Prince of Peace, endue us with thy holy grace,<br>seriously to lay to heart, the great dangers we are in from our unhappy divisions. Take away all hatred<br>and prejudice, and whatsoever else may hinder us from godly union and concord, and being true and<br>loyal subjects under our present happy constitution. That, as there is but one body and one spirit, and<br>one hope of our calling, one Lord, one faith, one baptism, one God and Father of us all; so may we<br>henceforth be all of one heart and one soul, united in one holy bond of truth and peace, of faith and<br>charity ; and may, with one mind and one mouth, glorify THEE, through JESUS Christ our Lord."<p>AMEN.</p>
