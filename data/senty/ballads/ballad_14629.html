	<p> Horrid & Barbarous<p>MURDER.<p>Committed upon the Body of Mary Thomson,<br>By her sweet-heart David Brown,<p>A FARM-SERVANT NEAR CARLISLE,<p>Who Seduced her under promise of Marriage,?and when, on account of her<br>pregnancy, she became urgent on their marriage, he appointed to meet<br>her at Lime Wood, where, in a lonely spot, he stabbed her with a knife,<br>and then threw her into a pond, with a quantity of stones tied into her<br>shawl. With an account of the wonderful discovery of the body, on which<br>was found the letter of appointment,?and which led to the apprehension<br>of the perpetrator of the dreadful crime.<p>DAVID BROWN, a young man, aged 21 years, and farm-servant to Mr<br>James Luke of Campton, has been fully committed to Carlisle Jail, for<br>the wilful murder of his sweetheart, Mary Thomson, a lovely girl, aged 19,<br>the only daughter of Isaac Thomson of Amsterdale, and servant to a respec-<br>table farmer of that neighbourhood. They had kept company together for<br>about twelve months ; and having, under promise of marriage, seduced her,<br>the consequence was she proved pregnant. On discovering her situation, she<br>urgently entreated him not to abandon her to the scorn of the world, but to<br>fulfill the solemn promise he had made, and marry her. He put her off from<br>time to time with evasive answers ; and after a week or two, he sent her the<br>following letter, which, happily for the ends of justice, was found upon her<br>person after she was murdered.<p>" Dear Mary.?To night, at seven o'clock, meet me at the north end of Lime Wood, near the<br>Willow Glen, and we will, quite undisturbed, at our leisure, arrange matters for our marriage,<br>and adopt plans for our future course of life Destroy this note, and let no person know you are<br>to meet me, else it may marr our projects.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yours, &c. D. BROWN."<p>With heart somewhat relieved, this poor young creature at the appointed<br>time hastened to the fatal spot, and with smiles the insidious fiend received<br>her. They walked on at a slow pace for about half-an-hour, till they came<br>to a lonely and dreary spot, where was a lake surrounded with trees. In a<br>moment the villian seized her, and with a knife stabbed her. She fell on her<br>knees, the blood flowing from her side, and tears running down her comely<br>cheeks, and cried, " Mercy ! David, Mercy!?Think on your baby, think<br>on myself!?think on the solemn vows you made !" But all in vain?The<br>villian repeated his murderous blows till she lay a lifeless corpse at his feet,<br>drenched in her reeking blood.<p>He then threw her body into the lake ; but the watchful eye of Providence<br>was upon him, and before the week expired, it was discovered, the monster<br>apprehended, and now awaits his trial, in irons, in the county jail.<p>COME all false-hearted young men,<p>And listen to my song,<br>'Tis of a cruel murder<p>That lately has been done.<br>On the body of a maiden fair,<p>The truth I will unfold,<br>The bare relation of this deed<p>Will make your blood run cold.<br>Near Amsterdale, in fair Carlisle,<p>Mary Thomson she did dwell,<br>In spotless fame long time she lived,<p>Till this to her befell.<br>By  David Brown's deluding tongue,<p>Poor Mary was beguiled,<br>And soon to her misfortune,<p>By him she proved with child.<br>Some days ago this damsel fair,<p>Did write to him with speed,<br>such tenderness she did express,<p>Would make a heart to bleed.<br>She said,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;my dearest David,<p>I am with child by thee,<br>Therefore, my dear pray let me know,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  <p>When you will marry me.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  <p>That selfsame night he did appoint<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To meet her in Lime Wood,<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where his true love soon did him meet,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ne'er dreading ought but good.<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When to the fatal spot they came,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A knife then forth he drew,<p>And while she loud for mercy call'd,<br>Did pierce her body threw.<p>He took the shawl from off her neck,<br>And round her body tied.<p>With peeble stones he did it fili,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thinking the crime to hide.<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;O then into the watery lake,<p>He plunged her straightway,<p>Which with her precious blood was stain'd,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And soon did him betray.<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;O then this young man taken was<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And into prison sent,<p>In rattling chains he is confined,<p>His crime for to lament.<br>Until the Assizes do come on,<p>When trembling he must stand,<br> Reflecting on the deed he's done,<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Waiting the dread command.<p><br>SANDERSON, PRINTER, 243, HIGH STREET, EDINBURGH.<p></p>
