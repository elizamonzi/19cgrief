	<p> Trial and Sentence!<p><p>A Full, True, and Particular ACCOUNT of the Trial and<br>Sentence of ROBERT JOHNSTON, GEORGE GAL-<br>LOWAY, and JAMES LEES, for Assault and Robbery, on<br>the 25th of October last, on the High Road, south of St.<br>Patrick's Square, Edinburgh; one of whom, (Robert John-<br>ston), is to be Executed at Edinburgh on Wednesday the<br>30th of December next. George Galloway to be Banished<br>for Fourteen, and James Lees for Seven years, beyond seas.<p>YESTERDAY, (Monday the 23d November, 1818,) came on before the<br> High Court of Justiciary, at Edinburgh, the Trial of ROBERT JOHN-<br>STON, GEORGE GALLOWAY, and JAMES LEES, accused of Assaulting<br>and Robbing Mr JOHN CHARLES, Candlemaker in Edinburgh, early on the.<br>morning of Sunday the 25th of October last, on the high road, a little to the<br>south of St. Patrick Square, on his way home to his house in Sciennes Street,<br>and taking from him the sum of £360 sterling, two bills, a watch key, and<br>part of a watch chain. Galloway and Lees pleaded Guilty to the indictment,<br>and Johnston Not Guilty.<p>John Charles, Candlemaker in Edinburgh, declared, that he was in a house<br>in the Fleshmarket Close, on the evening of the 24th ult. along with three other<br>persons, and staid there till about twelve o'clock, at which time he left the house,<br>and proceeded along the South Bridge and Nicholson Street, on his way home.<br>He was perfectly sober, after passing St. Patrick Square, about half way to the<br>Weighing-house, witness saw three persons a few yards before him, one of them<br>came forward and attacked him, and the other two came on afterwards. Wit-<br>ness then called out Robbery, and Police, when one of them presented a pistol<br>at him, and said, D?n you, do you see that; if you call out again, I will blow<br>your brains out: but could not tell which of the three it was. Witness was<br>then tumbled off the footpath, and grasped by the throat, which bled his lip;<br>and while one held him down, by lying upon him, he felt another put his hand<br>into his pocket, and pull out his money, consisting of L. 360, a bill for L. 212,<br>and an acknowledgement for L. 40, and also that his watch was violently grasp-<br>ed at, but not taken from him : Witness then saw the three persons who rob-<br>bed him run over the wall, and one of them had on a fustian jacket, which he<br>found afterward to be Johnston, who was the most active in the robbery. He<br>had just time to get on his feet, and was looking for his hat, when a watchman<br>came up to him. There was another hat lying on the ground, which was taken<br>to the watch-house, whither he also went, and stated to Captain Brown the whole<br>particulars of the robbery : Witness was afterwards informed by Mr Harvie, so-<br>licitor, Leith, that a considerable sum of money had been lodged in his hands<br>by a person named Munoch, which he suspected was part of what was stolen<br>from him.<p>William Munoch, servant to Mr Darling, Leith, is acquainted with Johnston<br>and Galloway. They came to his room on the 25th ult. at half-past seven o'-<br>clock, when Johnston asked him to rise and get a dram of whisky with him<br>and Galloway, witness went with them to a house at Bonnington Toll, possessed<br>by Mrs Taylor, where Johnston asked him if he would keep some money for<br>him a day or two, which he consented to do, and got from him accordingly, a<br>number of notes all squeezed together. Johnston told him he got the money<br>from a drunk man, and witness immediately put it into his pocket. They then<br>proceeded to another public house nearer Edinburgh, and after sitting there for<br>some time, witness went home, when he found that the money he received  a-<br>mounted to £304 : 6s Witness did not know what to think of the money and<br>therefore communicated the whole affair to his master, who went next day along<br>with him to Mr Harvey, solicitor, and delivered the money to him, together with<br>all the circumstances of the case. Witness saw the money given to Captain<br>Brown, and a receipt got for it, and put his initials on the back of the notes,<br>which he now sees and identifies. This witness was seriously admonished to<br>keep good company in future.<p>Alexander M'Kay, night watchman, knows the prisoners, and saw them on the<br>night of the robbery, at half-past twelve o'clock, when they were all together, and<br>another boy with them. James Richardson, night watchman, knows Mr Charles,<br>and  remembers on the night of the 24th ult. of hearing a call of " Robbery !"<br>and " Police," upon which he immediately went to the place from which the cry<br>proceeded, and found Mr Charles standing without his hat, which was soon found,<br>and another hat lying near it, when Mr Charles  told him he had been robbed.<p>After the examination of several other witnesses, the&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lord Advocate shortly<p>addressed the Jury for the Crown, and the Lord Justice Clerk then summed up<p>the evidence at considerable length; when  the jury&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;without  leaving their seats,<p>returned a viva voce verdict, unanimously finding the prioners, Galloway and<p>Lees,Guilty,upon their own  confession, and also John ston from incontoverta-<p>able evidence.<p>The Lord Justice Clerk then pronounced the awful sentence of the law upon<p>the prisoners,  which was, that Galloway should be transported beyond seas for<p>fourteen, and Lees for seven years; and that Johnston should be executed on<p>Wednesday the 30th of December next.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; His Lordship then solemnly exhorted<p>Johnston to prepare for his awful change, and to spend the few days yet allow-<p>ed him on earth in endeavouring to make up his peace with Almighy God.<p>PRICE ONE PENNY.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
