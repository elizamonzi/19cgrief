	<p> A Full and Particular Account of the Trial and Sentence of James<br>Anderson and David Glenn, who are to be Executed at the spot where the<br>crime war committed, on Friday, the 12th December 1823, for the<br>Murder of John M'Clure, and their bodies to be given for Dissection.<p>BEFORE the High Court of Justiciary, at Edinburgh, on Wed-<br>nesday the 5th November 1823, JAMES ANDERSON, DA-<br>VID  GLENN,  MARGARET  FREW, and MARGARET AN-<br>DERSON, were indicted for Murder, in having, on the 6th day of<br>July last, attacked John M'Clure, on the road leading from the<br>town of Ayr to the village of Ochiltree, and beat and kicked him in<br>such a manner as to occasion his death a few hours after.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  To<br>which they pled Not Guilty.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <p>Thomas Young, a student, who left Ochiltree in company with<br>the deceased Mr John M'Clure, and who was attacked on the road<br>at the same time with him, by the prisoners, described, at consider<br>able length, the circumstances of the attack.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They gave no provo<br>cation whatever.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They appeared to be intoxicated, and witness<br>and M'Clure did not even speak to them before they attacked them<br>His evidence was corroborated by that of James  Bryden, another <br>student, and of James Tod, merchant, Ayr, who passed  them at the<br>time in a car or gig, and who on seeing them attacked, stopped the<br>gig and eame to their assistance,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; M'Clure was struck, kicked, and<br>terribly abused, and Bryden says, in the last attack M'Clure&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;was<br>standing on the side of&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;road, holding his umbrella before<br>him, when Anderson ran in upon him, and knocked him down a-<br>gain.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; M'Clure called out, " O !  man, let me alone, I can do no<br>more, and you have done enough."&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He was ultimately got into&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; .<br>the gig and taken home, and died in two hours after.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After the ex-<br>amination of several witnesses, the pannels' declarations were read<br>in which they stated that they had been drinking in the toll-house,<br>and were  much intoxicated.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some  had  a confused  recollection<br>of the affray on the road, and others said that they recollected no-<br>thing'at all about it.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; John Hunter, keeper of the toll-bar at Holm-<br>ston, near where the assault took place, was then  examined, in ex-<br>calpation, but his evidence brought out nothing in favour of the ac-<br>cused, but rather tended to confirm several parts of the evidence for<br>the prosecution.<p>The Lord Advocate addressed the Jury for the Crown, at consi-<br>derable length, and stated, that this case was to  have been tried at.<br>the Ayr Circuit, but, from an accidendtal error in the indictment, it<br>had been certified to this court; and he was glad it had taken, place'<br>here, where no local feelings could interfere with the investigation.'<br>His Lordship concluded by saying, that the evidence.warranted'<br>him in asking from them a verdict of murder against all the prison-<br>ers.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He was followed by Mr Napier for the prisoners, who insist- <br>ed on the possibility of the death of M'Clure being occasioned by<br>apoplexy, brought on by agitation and exertion on the unlucky oc-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>casion.<p>After which the Lord Justice Clerk summed up the evidence,<br>At great length, and decidedly expressed his own opinion, that the<br>crime of murder had been proved against the male prisoners,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The<br>Jury, in twenty minutes, returned an unanimous verdict,  finding<br>James Anderson and David Glenn Guilty of the crime, libelled ; but<br>in consequence of the murder not having been premeditated, recom-<br>mended them to mercy; and the libel Not Proven against the fe-<br>male prisoners.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The women, after a solemn advice from the Lord<br>Justice Clerk, were dismissed from the bar.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; .&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <p>After a few  observations from Lord-Picmilly. in which Lord<br>Meadowbank entirely concurred, the Lord Justice Clerk then said,<br>in performing the painful duty which now devolved on him,he did<br>not wish to say any thing to aggravate those feelings, with which,<br>by their demeanour, the prisoners seemed to have been impressed<br>throughout this investigation ; but it was incumbent him to warn<br>them to adopt that line of conduct which would be most  for their<br>interest, both in this world, and that, to come, whatever might be<br>the issue of this day's proceedings.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The recommendation of the<br>Jury, and the ground of it, would be forwarded to the proper quar-<br>ter ; but he advised them not to trust to its success ; for, in consi-<br>dering that recommendation, the whole of the case would be taken<br>into view; and he thought it his duty not to hold our to them any<br>flattering hopes that might not be realized.  On the contrary, he<br>implored them to consider themselves as on the brink of eternity.<br>If their repentance was sincere, mercy was promised to the chief of<br>sinners; but if they remained hardened a more dreadful day of<br>;  reckoning awaited them.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Even if their lives should be spared, it<br>would be incumbent on them to follow a new course of life, and by<br>their future good conduct, to redeem the past. The sentence of the<br>Court was, that they should be removed from the Jail of Edinburgh,<br>on the 17th of November, and transmitted to the Jail of Ayr; from<br>whence they should be taken to such place as the Magistrates might<br>appoint, on Friday the 12th day of December next, and there public-<br>ly execn ed, and their bodies given to Dr Munro for dissection.</p>
