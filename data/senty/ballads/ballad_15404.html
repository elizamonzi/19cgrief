	<p> Most Shameful <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;RIOT<p>AT THE<p>Anti-Popery Lecture<br>Roxburgh Street Church.<p>Edinburgh, Saturday,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;March 18, 1841.<p>Seldom has our city been the scene of<br>such a disgraceful riot as that which took<br>place last night, The following are a few<br>particulars connected with it, as they have<br>reachedus; but the whole will of course<br>soon undergo a judicial investigation.<p>For some weeks past a Mr Leckie has<br>been delivering a course of lectures against<br>Popery, in Roxburgh Street Chapel, in<br>which he zealously endeavoured to refute<br>and expose the errors and fallacies promul-<br>gated by the doctrines of the Church of<br>Rome. These lectures, we understand,<br>have been pretty well attended throughout,<br>and in general conducted with a good deal<br>of decorum ; though it was evident that his<br>severe animadversions on the tenets of their<br>faith were productive of any thing but the<br>most amicable feelings in the bosoms of that<br>section of his auditors who were adherents<br>of the Roman Catholic persuasion. Symp-<br>toms of these feelings.  occasionally evinced<br>themselves at some of the meetings ; but on<br>Wednesday evening their demonstration<br>was somewhat more noisey than on previous<br>occasions. The subject of that evening's<br>lecture being to be resumed last night, the<br>house was early filled, and from the turbu-<br>lence which  prevailed&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;before  the&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;hour of<br>lecture, it became apparent that the opposi-<br>tion party had mustered their forces in great<br>strength, and now bade defiance to all order.<br>In this state of things, it was deemed ad-<br>viseable to postpone the lecture till another<br>meeting would be held in which order might<br>be secured.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But on Mr Leckie's attempt-<br>ing to make this announcement to the meet-<br>ing, it became the signal for commencing a<br>general row ; and, amidst the most defening<br>mixture of shouts, yells, groans, and hisses,<br>the book-boards of several of the pews were<br>torn down, and thrown promiscuously about<br>the house.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The noise and confusion of the<br>scene soon extended itself to the outside of<br>the house,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;where an&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;immense  crowd was<br>soon collected.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Meanwhile the proceedings<br>of the assailants within went on briskly?<br>the peaceable part of the auditory,  in en-<br>deavouring to make out, were met by the<br>uplifted sticks of the others, and were glad<br>to shelter themselves behind the pillars and<br>even under the seats.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  A body of police,<br>however, at  length  arrived, and succeeded,<br>though with some difficulty, in taking into<br>custody some of the  principal  actors in the<br>affray, whom they conveyed to the police-<br>office ; a dense crowd accompanying them<br>the whole of the way.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We understand that<br>considerable damage has been done to the<br>fittings of the Church.<p>In expectation of the case being heard to-<br>day, the Police Court was considerably<br>thronged. It is said, however, to come on<br>before the Sheriff on Tuesday.<p>---------ooo--------<p>Sanderson, Printer, Edinburgh.</p>
