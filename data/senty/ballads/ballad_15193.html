	<p> A Full and Particular Account of the<br>Trial and Sentence of Allan Grant,<br>James Kenny Stewart, Mary Muirhead,<br>and Isabella Kerr or Gray, who were<br>tried at Edinr. before the High Court<br>of Justiciary, for the Crimes of Murder,<br>Robbery, and Theft, on Monday the<br>5th day of March 1827, and who are<br>all to be transported, Grant for Life,<br>Kenny Stewart and Mary Muirhead<br>for Fourteen, and Kerr or Gray for<br>Seven years.<p>AT Edinburgh, on Monday the 5th March 1827,<br>came on before the High Court of Justiciary,<br>the trial of Allan Grant,sometime a travelling pack-<br>man, James Kenny Stewart, Pensioner from 94th<br>Regiment of foot, Mary Muirhead, and Isabella Kerr<br>or Gray widow of Wm. Gray, Writer in Edinburgh,<br>accused of Murder, Robbery, and Theft; in so far<br>as they, on the evening of the 10th January last,<br>within the house occupied by the said James Kenny<br>Stewert, in North Bank Street of Edinburgh, wick-<br>edly and feloniously stole and theftuously carry <br>away, from the now deceased Mark Dow, late Shoe-<br>maker in Edinburgh, a bill, notes and silver to the<br>amount of upwards of £80 sterling, and other<br>articles ; also, in or near the same place, they viol-<br>ently, wickedly, and feloniously attacked and ass-<br>aulted the said Mark Dow, by violently throwing<br>and dashing him on the stair, or on the flagstones<br>in the passage, by which his neck was dislocated,<br>and he shortly thereafter died in consequence; and<br>further, they wickedly and feloniously attacked and<br>assaulted the said Mark Dow, and seized and threw<br>him with great violence upon the pavement of the<br>said passage, or on the stair leading therefrom up<br>to Bank Street, and, while lying upon the pave-<br>meat or stair and disabled from making any resist-<br>ance, they seized and robbed him of a black cloth<br>coat, a pair of leather shoes, a black cloth vest, a<br>black hat, a white neckcloth, and a pair of braces,<br>all his property. To all which they pled Not<br>Guilty.<p>Several witnesses were then examined, one of<br>whom knew Grant for 8 years as a common thief.<br>Another police officer stated, when he was brought<br>to the office, a one pound note was found in the<br>sleeve of his coat, with six shillings and threepence,<br>and a silver pencil case in his pocket.<p>It was intimated, after a number of witnesses<br>were examined, and the prisoners declarations was<br>then read, that Grant was desirous to alter his plea,<br>his counsel having advised him to plead guilty to<br>the theft, (except as to the bill) as libelled, which<br>was done accordingly. The Lord Advocate had<br>now brought forward, he said, every individual<br>who could throw any light on this dark transaction,<br>but the evidence had failed to establish the murder.<p>His Lordship then restricted the libel, and the<br>jury after a few observations from the Lord Justice<br>Clerk, returned a unanamous verdict, finding the<br>murder and robbery not proven?Gray guilty in<br>terras of her own confession?Muirhead, Stewart,<br>and Grant guilty, in terms of their own confession,<br>and upon the evidence adduced.<p>Lord Meadow bank then proposed that Crant<br>should be transported for life?Stewart and Muir-<br>head for fourteen years, and Gray for seven years,<br>and they were sentenced accordingly.<p>Grant was known as a hawker through the city,<br>and is of a singular formation of body ; having at<br>one time had his back broken by a bank of earth<br>falling on him. Kenny Steware is a respectable<br>looking young man, who had lost his left hand<br>when a soldier. The two females have been long<br>known to the police as public pests.</p>
