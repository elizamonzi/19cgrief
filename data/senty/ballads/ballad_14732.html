	<p> EXECUTION<br>OF&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>THOMAS CONNOR AND BELL M'MENEMY,<p>For Robbery and Assault with intent to Murder.<p>Glasgow, October 22d, 1828.<p>This morning Thomas Connor, and Beil<br>McMenemy suffered in front of the New Jail, a-<br>greable to their sentence. The crowd began to<br>collect this morning by day break, and by Seven<br>o'clock the crowd became so great, that num-<br>bers were severely bruised and otherwise hurt by<br>the extreme pressure against the railing which<br>separates the green from the street.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<p>About ten minutes to eight, the unfortunat<br>criminals made their appearance. Connor<br>seemed much dejected, and had to be supported<br>to the platform, while McMenemy, though be-<br>longing to the more timid sex, appeared to meet<br>her fate with greater resolution. Her courage<br>failed her, however, when she reached the plat-<br>form, and saw the multitude, who were met to<br>witness the miserable end of herself, and her<br>companion in crime.<p>Upon taking leave of her friends before com-<br>ing out to the Scaffold, she with great emotion de-<br>livered an advice to the young and unguarded.- the<br>following were the principal topics of her solemn<br>warning. She advised all in general, and females<br>in, particular, to avoid vicious and profine,asso-<br>ciates?to keep regular hours?to cultivate ac-<br>quaintance with the sober, the industrious, and<br>the religious part of the community?and regu-<br>larly to attend Divine Worship , and while such<br>conduct would secure them from ignominy, to<br>which she was deservedly exposed, it would also<br>give peace of mind, and make them respectable<br>members of Society. She had now seen the evil<br>of her ways, and found that the only way to hap-<br>piness is the way of heavenly wisdom; and<br>with the last words which she would utter on<br>earth, she would solemnly call upon all to<br>turn from their wickedness, and seek mercy<br>while it is yet, to be found. Hoping her last end<br>would prove a warning to those following a course<br>of iniquity, she Would bid them all FAREWELL!<p>After taking a farewell.of this world, her coun-<br>tenance exhibiting deep marks of penitence and<br>resignation, she placed herself in a proper<br>situation for the executioner to do his duty.<br>Her companion who had gazed on her for some<br>time with an expression of grief and des-<br>pair, now placed himself by her side. They<br>shook hands, and their faces were covered. Af-<br>ter a few minutes spent in private devotion, the<br>signal was made, and the partners who had lived<br>together in crime, were ushured together into the<br>world of spirits.<p>These unfortunate individuals who have this<br>day suffered the highest penalty which the law<br>can inflict, were tried on Wednesday, the 17th of<br>September last, along with other two, who were<br>acquitted.<p>They were all charged with the crimes of as-<br>sault and robbery. Having attacked a person<br>of the name of McKennon, near the Paisley<br>Canal, on the night of the 20th of May last, after<br>having cruelly abused him, they robbed him of<br>two Pounds and a pair of shoes.<p>Ever since their sentence, they have been to<br>all outward appearance extremely penitent, con-<br>fessing their crimes, and praying for forgiveness.<br>The female appeared to be much shocked with<br>the idea of appearing before the crowd, and was<br>extremely agitated by the rumours which were<br>abroad concerning her.<p>This unfortunate young woman formerly resid-<br>ed in Paisley, and it was in this town that she first<br>departed from the line of honesty. Shortly after-<br>wards she removed to Glasgow, where evil com-<br>pany completed her ruin. She is but 25 years<br>of age, and the only woman that has been exe-<br>cuted in Glasgow these 32 years. Such was the<br>public excitement on this occasion, that the City<br>was in a commotion during the whole night; and<br>strangers continued to pour in from Paisley, and<br>other parts in the country from three in the morn -<br>ning up to the hour of execution.<p>During the time which, has elapsed since re-<br>ceiving sentence, they have been regularly visited<br>by most respectable Clergymen of various per-<br>suasions, who all united in their laudable en-<br>deavours, to open the eyes of their understand-<br>ings to a proper sense of their condition.<p>A few minutes before they left the hall,  they  <br>lifted their voices, along with a number of persons<br>present, in praising God, by singing the follow-<br>ing hymn.<p>When rising from the  bed of death,<br>O'erwhelm'd with guilt and fear,<br>I see,my Maker face to face,<br>O how shall I appear <br>If yet while pardon may be found,<br>And mercy may bo sought,<br>My heart with, inward horror shrinks,<br>And trembles at the thought.<p>When thou, O Lord, shalt stand disclos'd<br>In majesty severe,<br>And sit in judgment on my soul,<br>O how shall I appear&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  <br>But thou hart told the troubled mind<br>Who doth her sins lament,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>That timely grief for errors past,<br>Shall future woe prevent.<p>Then see the sorrows of my heart,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  <br>Ere yet it be too late ;<br>And hear my Saviour's dying groans,<br>To give these sorrows weight.<br>For never shall my soul despair<br>For mercy at thy throne<br>Who knows thine only Son has died<br>Thy justice to atone<p>It may not be improper to notice, that this un-<br>fortunate female appeared at her execution dres.,<br>sed in a suit of clothes most generously bestowed<br>by the Female Benevolent. Society. The multi-<br>tude was most immense ; every spot from which<br>it was possible to obtain a glimpse of the sufferers<br>being literally crammed with spectators.<p>Printed  by Edwards .&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
