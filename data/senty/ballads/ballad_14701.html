	<p> Second&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Edition.<p>AWFUL CRUELTY.<p>Account of the cruel and inhuman treatment of a child, by its own Father, of<br>the name of M'Gregor, or Rogers, residing in Kirkintilloch, who kept the <br>child in an empty barrel for some years, till he was more like one of the<br>monkey species than a human being, and for whole days without any food,<br>striking and abusing him in the most unmerciful manner, ordering him to be<br>cast in to the swine; on his body were marks as if the child had been burned<br>in the fire! he was covered with wounds and his feet were swollen, and large<br>blue blisters on them; his loins and thighs were skinless, and he exhibited<br>altogether a deplorable instance of culpable neglect and savage cruelty.<p>Cruelty.?We have been informed that, in the neighbourhood of Kirkintil-<br>loch there has been found a young boy, who has been concealed for years in<br>a meal-barrel, aud fed on the coarsest of food, by its father, a conntry labou-<br>rer, whose name is Rogers. When seen by Mr Fleming, one of the crimi-<br>nal officers of the police establishment, the child was dreadfully emaciated.<br>The Sheriff is making investigation into the circumstances.--Chronicle.<p>Further Particulars from the same paper.?Upwards of two years ago, a<br>labouring man in the neighbourhood of Kirkintilloch had a child sent home<br>to him by the mother, which his relations seem to be so much ashamed that<br>in order to conceal it from their neighbours, they kept in a meal-barrel. The<br>position in which it was compelled to crouch and compress itself was such as<br>to render it completely deformed?its knees almost on a level with its head,<br>while its emaciated frame renders it an object of pity. It speaks not, but<br>chatters like a monkey in distress. Death, and not preservation, seems too<br>evidently to have been the object of those noder whose charge it was placed.<br>The manner by which it was discovered was merely accidental. A neighbour<br>happened to call in to talk a little, in passing, when, to his astonishment, a<br> thing, to use his own words, awful and unearthly came creeping out, utter-<br>iug cries different from any human creature.  He knew not what it was; but<br>this he knew, that he was terribly feared; and the other person seemed to be<br>as much confused as he was, for, on sceing it approach, he rose hurriedly,<br>gave it a kick, and ordered it back to its place, as if it had been a dog. The<br>visitor, however, seeing distinctly that it was not a dog, went and gave infor-<br>mation to the authorities, by whom an examination is now instituted.<p>A friend of ours, who visited the place where the child is, says that he was<br>completely horror struck when he entered the apartment, on Sunday last,-<br>The child, he says, had been led on potato-skins, and was a mere skeleton,<br>being more like a monkey than a human being, hair covering a great part of<br>the body. It is said, the sums contributed for the support of the child, by<br>visitors, on Sunday, amounted to two pounds seventeen shillings.<p>The child was discovered by, the neighbours to be harshly used, receiving<br>no attention from the hands of its parent, but unmerciful beatings and never<br>taken into bed, although the wife had no child of her own, but allowed to lie<br>at the fireside on a miserable shake-down. In consequence of this treatment<br>the child rapidly lost strength; and in a short time, from being a well-condi-<br>tioned boy, he exhibited a cadaverous hue and an attenuated form, searceiv<br>left him a vestige of the human appearance. His unnatural protectors have<br>frequently, day after day, in the house himself, with the door locked,and have<br>returned at one o'clock in the morning from Glasgow, while the frightened  ann<br>wretched child wearied with crying, has been ordered to his pallet, without a<br>bit of bread. Previous to leaving his nurse he could say small words, such<br>as ' aye, and no,' but under this horrible neglect, and atrocious usage, he<br>soon ceased to speak a word, and now the only sounds he can utter resemble<br>the grunt of the sow, which fitly formed one of the household.<p>Many are the statements made regarding the conduct of the parents wreak-<br>ing their vengeance and spleen upon the devoted head of their unhappy<br>child; and even now, though improved by the fostering care of his present<br>nurse, there are marks upon his body add llmbs that bear out all that has been<br>stated even to the burning of the child on the flre! She states that when she<br>received him, by permission of the father, about a fortnight ago, the child was<br>by all the world line a monkey without hair; he was covered with wounds,<br>and his feet were swollen, and large blue blisters were upon them. There<br>were also marks upon the belly, and he had a peculiar way of sitting, as if he<br>had been accustomed to lie and sit on a barrel, his loins and thighs were also<br>skinless! and he exhibited altogether a deplorable instance of culpable neglect<br>and savage cruelty. Now though his skin is healed, save a severe eut on the<br>head, his appearance is truly pitiable; starvation and brutality have so strongly<br>marked him, that while his shrunken figure shows but an infantile size, his<br>comparatively old and intelligent face rather startles the beholder. Have the<br>authorities nothing to do with the father?<p>Muir, Printer, Glasgow.</p>
