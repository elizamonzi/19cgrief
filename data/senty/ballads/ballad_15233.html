	<p> WILLIAM BURKE.?A New Sung.<p>Come all you resurrection men I pray you beware.<br>You see  what  has&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;happened  William&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Burke,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and  likewise<br>William Hare.<br>Hare he kept a lodging house, it  was in the  West Port,<br>Where all kinds of travellers an to it did resort<br>He lodged all both great and  small , as she track to your [&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  <br>Till at last he began to murder them, to the Doctors for to sell<br>The first was  Margret Paterson, as I did he r them say,<br>A young girl in the Cannongate, that drink had led&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;astray<br>This William Burke fell in with her, and soon she did agree<br>With him to go, but little know that her butcher He would be.<br>The next was poor Daft Jamie, as I did hear them say,<br>That often  on the streets with bairns used to play.<br>Ta the Fleshmarket he often did resort,<br>The Fleshers all being, kind to him, for with him they did good sport.<br>And the barkers all,  both  great and small, with him she&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;well<br>agree,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>Although that he was void of sense, right innocent with be.<br>But one day as Jamie walked all along [  ] the street,<br>With these two body snatchers he sh[&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;] for to meet,<br>Then Burke&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;showed him some&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;money, and said Jamie cam<br>away<br>And like Judas with our Savious this lamb they did slay.<br>They went into a silent place and got this murder done<br>The next was an old woman that same to seek her son.<br>'He was a soldier and in the Castle lay,<br>And Burke saw her a stranger, and soon did  her betray.<br>He said, I keep lodgings, and come along with me.<br>And you shall be well used, and that you soon shall see<br>He showed a bed and said to her, mistress, you'll  lye here,<br>Aud you will get soon asleep,before  it be morning clear<br>Now she has took off all  her clothes, and went into her rest,<br>But she little knew the serpent that was within their breast.<br>And now then the gathered, and soon to work they fell<br>And they murdered this old woman, and  to doctor did  her<br>sell;<br>And now they got this over, and thought that all was past,<br>But down come the police and taken they were at last,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>And now before the bar of Justice they did appear,<br>But Hare and his wife turned evidence themselves for clear.<br>Now Burke received his sentence, and is sent back to the Jail<br>Now he lies there to morn his wretched case,<br>And Hair should be there if right does take place.<br>And for these women they should be burnt for such a murder,<br>Never to be seen again in any town  or country.<br>Written by John Logan !<p>The Committee who undertook, at Dr. Knox's request,to  in-<br>vestigate the rumours against him, have published their Report,<br>signed by nine gentlemen. The Report says they have seen no<br>evidence that Dr. knox or his assistants knew that murder had<br>been committed, and believe they did not: that they are satis-<br>fied no suspicion was excited in Dr. KnOx's mind that they were<br>so ; that there were no marks upon the bodies which could lead<br>to such suspicion ; that no such suspicion wee ever hinted to<br>him; that, consequently, no attempts were made to disguise<br>appearances. They consider Dr- Knox culpable in entertaining<br>she opinion that uninterred bodies could be purchased from re-<br>latives; and that this opinion led him to give ear to the tales of<br>Burke ; and that, by the laxity of his system of receiving bo-<br>dies, he gave a facility to Burke and Hare, in the disposal of<br>their victims, which other wise would not have existed. This<br>they consider the only ground of censure against Dr. Knox,<br>None of the evidence is given.</p>
