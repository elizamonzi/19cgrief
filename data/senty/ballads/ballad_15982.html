	<p> Discovery,<p>OF&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  <p>Ancient Relics.<p>A Full, True, and Interersting Account' of<br>that Remarkable and Important Discovery<br>made yesterday in taking down the old<br>houses in the Castle-hill, when there was<br>found a box contanig several Ancient Coins,<br>a Massy Gold Ring, an old fashioned Dirk.<br>and a Wonderful Prophecy made in the<br>yerar 1550, respecting great events which<br>are to happen this present year. <p>A Report has  just reached  us of a very <br>Remarkable and Interesting Discovery bar-<br>ing been made yesterday by the labourer.<br>employed in taking down an old house in<br>the Castle-hill', of a wooden Box containing<br>Several very ancient relics and a Wonderful<br>Propheey made in the year 1550, relative to<br>Strange events which are to take  place this <br>present  year.<p>From the confused statement  so hastily <br>made to us  we  have  endeavoured to collect<br>the following interesting particulars : ??<p>Our  readers are already  aware that  most.<br>of the tenements in tho Castle-hill are of <br>very ancient  constructure, more especially <br>those situated  in the closes  or alleys leading<br>from the main street down to the Grass<br>market  and  were in former  days inhabited<br>by the wealthy and the powerful of the -<br>land. Though we could mention the names<br>of many  of the noble occupiers  of these once<br>magnificent but now decidedly humble dwel-<br>lings,we deem it here would be superfluous.<br>and referring the curious to Chalmers'  Tra-<br>ditions, we shall at once proceed to the sub-<br>ject of the discovery.<p>As some of the workmen employed in tak-<br>ing down the houses  in the Castle-hill which<br>stand in the line of the New Improvements<br>were busily engaged  in loosening part of a<br>joint wall of mutual gable. and while one of<br>them was in the act of displecing a stone of<br>pretty large dimensions, his attention was<br>arrested at the sight  of a wooden box con-<br>cealed in a cavity beneath On examination<br>it was found to be made of oak, in a state of<br>excellent preservation, the sides were clasp-<br>ed with iron, and the lid carefully nailed and<br>sealed down. It appeared that it must have<br>been secreted in the wall at some period  sub-<br>sequent to its erection, for a piece of stone<br>was found neatly fitted in on the inside of<br>what had lately been a small chamber.<p>On opening the box, there was found de-<br>posited within several very ancient coins, a<br>massy gold ring, seemingly of great antiqui-<br>ty, a curious sort of dirk, richly Studded<br>with silver, and a piece of parchment tightly<br>rolled together, bearing the following curious<br>inscription, wrote in old fashioned but very<br>intelligible characters:?<p>" 1550, Januarie 12. [A Bytter Frost.]<br>In ye year 1881, There shalle be myghtie<br>trobelles. Ye countrye shalle be on ye brink-<br>of destroctione, but they re shalle aryse meane <br>aboundinge in vertew and talente, we shalle<br>restor it to helthe and soundenesse, and cause<br>ye pepel to lyve in prosperytye. Ye power<br>turned agynst ye pepel shalle be yeelded to'<br>its ryghtful owners."<p>It is to be hoped that these valuable anti-<br>quities will be carefully preserved and sub-<br>mitted to the inspection of the curious.<p>Edinburgh, Printed for the Booksellers,.<br>Price One Penny.</p>
