In your trial you have been assisted with able Counsel, and the Jury by whom<br>you have been convicted bestowed upon the circumstances of your case the most unwearied<br>attention; and you are now to receive the sentence which the laws of the country have a-<br>warded, and which it is my painful duty to pronounce. The evidence upon which you have<br>been convicted entirely shuts out all hopes of mercy being extended to you in this worlds<br>I therefore wish to impress upon your mind, that your days are numbered, that you stand<br>upon the verge of eternity, and very shortly you must appear before the tribunal of the At<br>mighty, where we shall all have to answer for our conduct in this world. I chaage you not<br>to buoy youaself up with the slightest hope of mercy?it never can be granted to you in this<br>world. I therefore solemnly advise you to make the best use of the short time you have to<br>live. I am sure that the excellent Ministers of our holy religion, of this city, will be ready<br>to afford you that spiritual advice and comfort which your awful situation requires; and I<br>trust you will avail yourself of every assistance for sincere repentance. The learned Judge<br>concluded by passing sentence of death, ordaining the unhappy man to be Executed at Glas<br>gow, on Wednesday the 7th of June next, betwixt 8 and 10 in the morning.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<p>John Muir, printer, Glasgow. </p>
