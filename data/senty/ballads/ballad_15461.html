	<h2>Transcription</h2>
	<p> Life, Sufferings, and Death<p>OF<p>Janet Fleming,<p>Daughter of a respectable Farmer near Dunse who was seduced by a pro-<br>fligate young Nobleman - brought to Edinburgh, and kept in the great-<br>estep'cndour or some time  and then cruelly deserted and thrown upon<br>the town?where, after passing through the num rous vicissitudes of a<br>wicked life she at last fell a victim to disease and died in a noted house<br>in James's Square. With a copy of an Interesting Letter she wrote to<br>her aged parentn, a few days before her death?an account of their Visit<br>to her miserable abode,?and a copy of Verses found under her pil ow<br>after her decease.<p>MISS JANET FLEMING was the elder daughter<br>of Mr Alexander Fleming, a respectable farmer<br>in the vicinity of Dunse. At the early age of seventeen,<br>Janet had the misfortune to attract the attention of a,<br>Profligate young nobleman who happened to be on a<br>fishing excursion in that neighbourhood Determined<br>to effect her ruin, he took every opportunity of putting<br>himself in her way; and, by making her numberless<br>little presents, and filling her head with notions of future<br>grandure, he prevailed upon the unsuspecting maid to<br>quit her parents' roof, and go  with him to Edinburgh.<p>Upon her arrival in town, her noble seducer placed<br>her in stylish lodgings, where she was dressed in the most<br>fashionable manner, and had a maid to wait upon her.<br>He took her to all fa hionable places of amusements, and<br>never seemed happy but when in her company. In this<br>manner about twelve month passed away, in a continual<br>round of dissipation, when there appeared a visible change<br>in the conduct of her noble and vile seducer. His visits<br>became less frequent?he upbraided her with extrava.<br>gance?and she, in return, reproached him with seducing<br>her from her dear parents and peaceful home. Things<br>went on in this way for a few weeks, when the wretch<br>set off for the Continent, leaving her in possession of<br>only a few shillings, and heavily in arrears with her land-<br>lady. For some time she subsisted by pawning the trin-<br>kets and other valuables presented by her seducer, until<br>she attracted the notice of a young gentleman of fashion,<br>with whom she cohabited for nearly three months. Left<br>again to her own resources, and descending step by step,<br>she was at length reduced to obtain a livelihood by the<br>casual wages of' prostitution ; and ran from one scene of<br>dissipation to another, undergoing all the pains of loath<br>some disease, which persons seldom escape whose lives<br>are spent in acts of debauchery. At last, worn out by the<br>fatigues of a wicked and vicious life, she lay down on<br>that fatal bed from which she would never rise in life.?<br>and, conscious of her approaching dissolution, wrote the<br>following short epistle to her afflicted parents ;?<p>" Dear Father and Mother.?If you have not altogether discarded from<br>your m  mory, as unworthy of even occupying a place in your thoughts, her<br>whom you once loved, and reared wich such parental fondness. but who so<br>vilely repaid your affection te attentions and slighted your friendly instruc-<br>tions, as to oppress with sorrow the hearts and cover with shame the heads<br>which she was bound to lighten and to honour, you will yet drop a tear of<br>pity on the receipt of this.<p>Deluded by the flattering promises of Lord .----? , I was prevailed on<br>to desert my peaceful home, and acconpany him to this town, where after<br>a few months of the most assiduous attention his conduct became more re-<br>served, and at length she artful seducer left me a prey to misery and ruin<br>I cannot paint to you my further degradasion?suffice it to tay, that, for the<br>last twelve months, I have frequenty been in a state of utter destitution :<br>and  in  mements  of retrospective cogitation, have often been disposed to<br>add self-destruction to my catalogue of crimes But. God be praised,I <br>have been yet been prevented from rushing unbidden Into the presence of<br>my Almighty Maker, with all my sin unpardoned on my head. Stricken<br>now  by disease, and stretched on a bod of siekness, I feel the cold hand of<br>death press heavy apon me, and, mourning for the enormity of my trans-<br>gressions, I am still afraid to meet his chill embrace. Ere this world closes<br>on her for ever, once more to behold her beloved parents, and receive their<br>kind forgivenes, would afford a last consolation to their unfortunate daugh-<br>ter, JANET FLEMING."<p>With the utmost alacrity her agonized parents prepar"<br>ed for to visit their wretched daughter, and the follow-<br>ing morning saw them set off on the coach for Edinburgh,<br>accompanied by their younger daughter It was evening<br>when they found themselves in the precints of James's<br>Square, when they soon found the residence which con-<br>tained the poor unfortunate. No words can paint their<br>feelings on beholding her once more?no longer the red<br>cheeked, sparkling eyed girl they were wont so fondly to<br>look upon, but now'a pale, emaciated victim of disease,<br>stretched upon the bed of death. For the two succeed-<br>ing days she was unremittingly attended by her parents,<br>for whose exertions, and the religious instructions of a<br>worthy divine whom they had called, she was extremely<br>grateful. On the third evening, she breathed her last,?<br>dying apparently a sincere penitent,?surrounded by her<br>weeping parents and friends Under her pillow was<br>found the following lines :?<p>A woman's honour is a woman's all<br>You're lost for ever if perchance you fall;<br>In this, wit, fortune, beauty, form, and mind,<br>You give like atoms to the whistling wind.<p>All worth, all pleasure, is with honour 1ost,<br>A truth which thousands witness to their cost;<br>The fate of women deeply we deplore.<br>They fall like stars that set to rise no more.<br></p>
