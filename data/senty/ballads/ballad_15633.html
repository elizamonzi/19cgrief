	<p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; THE<p>Last&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SPEECH&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and DYING&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; WORDS<p><p>Ancient&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Baver&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Officer&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;in  Montiqu's&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Regiment.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  Who&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;was&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;execute at  the<br>Iron of Perth upon the Second Day&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of July  1720.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For killing 0F&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr.<br>Daroch Danceing-Master.<p>My time being but very short in this World, it is high Time for me to prepare for the<br>Way I have to go. I was born in Plymouth of right honourable and creditable Parents,<br>who have not been neglectful to instruct me to go in the right Way. But I still being ne-<br>glectful of their Reproof. I am now 28 Years of Age, of which I never spent one Hour in<br>the Service of GOD untill just how, I being now upon the Point of Death, all my Life-<br>time have I spent in Wickedness, and now GOD has been pleased in His Justice to bring<br>we to a most shameful and untimely Death which I truly deserved long ago, But my Father<br>having a  great  Love for me did bring me by it. But altho I had escaped the Punishment of<br>Man, yet 1 could not escape the just Judgement of GOD, For still afterwards I continuing<br>in my wicked Life I being a great Sabbath-Breaker, Cuiser and Swearer, and greatly given to<br>the Lusts the Flesh, and I being a great Dsobeyer of my Parents, neither would I listen.<br>to their Reproof, which is the Cause that I now suffer for hero now, I still dreaded this<br>Storm that I have to bide.  But I never studied to seek unto GOD that these Thing might be<br>prevented Oh! I have been a blind led poor miserable Sinner, never bow ing a Knee to GOD<br>for the riper I turned in Years I still waxed riper in in Sin and Wickedness. As for this<br>that I am to suffer for now, and as for him that I am to suffer for, he was an intimate Comerade of<br>shine, I went often times to fee his Ball where being some young Lady's, there the Devil<br>tempting me to fall into a Snare with them, I being often times tempting them to ly with me.<br>But their Master not suffering such Things which the Devil deluding me all along. I pikt a<br>Quarrel with Mr. Daroch the Master whereby that I might have Satisfaction of his Person,<br>but he not being given to Quarrels, I meeting him in the Kirk-yard of Perth then I bred a Quar-<br>rel with him and falling to beat him then he turns to me, where being stronger then I, he dirted<br>me all upon the Streets, I being not able for him in Grips, I went to make clean my Cloaths, and<br>he going to wash himself at a Well, I coming and finding him there, then I having a small Stik<br>in my Hand, I took him Over the Head he not be aware of me then turning about unto me I having<br>a Souldier that I hyred to bear Part with me, he being better skill'd in that Art than I. At the<br>two first Times he gave me a Wound in the Shoulder where I fell backward. Altho I had<br>the Devil in my Mind,yet he had on evil in his Mind;for he came to lift me up,but as the Souldier who<br>asslited me held him by the two Arms I recovering my self up upon my Feet again I being in<br>great Wrath against him the Devil being still in my Heart provoked me to commit the Murder<br>upon his Body, he not being able to defend himself. Then I thrust my Sword thorow his Breast<br>iustantly being laid Hands upon by the civil Law, not falling into the Hands of the military,<br>and being put into Prison I was found guilty of Death have received my Sentence, and now<br>alas I have but few Hours to live here. How shall I think to stand before the Bar of GOD<br>who ha spent my Time into such Wickedness, never waited upon Ordinances, nor thought<br>upon Death, till within 36 Hours of my Death. The Ministers of Perth took great Pairs<br>upon me encouraging me to seek for the Life to come, they told me to get to my Knees to<br>seek Mercy from GOD. But how shall I expect Mercy who have spent my Life in so<br>great Wickedness. Oh ! that I were to begin my L fe again; what Sort of a reformed Person<br>Should I be. Oh ! How would I frequent the Ordinances, still I would spend my Life in<br>Reacing and Prayer, I still mispent all the Sabbaths of my Life, the last.Sabbath I spent<br>it in Whoredome ; If such things could be that I might spend my last Sabbath in the Service<br>of GOD But my Hour is come, I am made a Monument to many Spectaiors. GOD did<br>gift me. with both Wit and Beauty, but alas I had no Grace therewith. I acknowledge my<br>Sentence to be just. I forgive all Persons hoping that GOD will forgive me. I pray GOD<br>may bless the Magistrates and Ministers of Perth likewise Mr. Darling Minister of Kinoul<br>and Mr. Lyon Minister of Kinphan, for these worthy Men's Prayers have not been wanting<br>to me.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; H I S  P R A Y E R.<p>O LORD, I being now upon the Brink of Eternity, I not being worthy to live any longer upon<br>thy Earth, but LORD keep me from the second De.th,and if it be thy holy and divine<br>Will, send I pray Thee; Thy blesseh Angels to transport my Soul to that blessed Calestial<br>City, and to wash me in the Blood of my Bissed Saviour tie LORD&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; JESUS&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; CHRIST, and<br>grant O LORD that I may enter the Gates of the heavenly Jerusalem. O that all both Young<br>and Old, great and sma1l would take Warning by me, and improve their Time while they may, left <p>the Time shall come when you shall say I have no Pleasure in them ;as I have now.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And likewise ,<br>Remember thy  Creator in the Days of thy Youth.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I have no more to say, but into thy&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hands<br>do I commit my Spirit, O LORD JESUS receive my Soul.<p>F I N I S</p>
