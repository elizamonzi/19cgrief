	<p> THE&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;L A S T<p>SPEECH and DYING WORDS,<p>Of Neil Cordey Sentinel in the Fuziliers, who was<br>Execute in the Grass-Market of Edinburgh on the<br>25th Instant ; for Murdering John, Anderson<br>Coachman in the Cannongate,<p>I Am brought here this Day to suffer an unnatural and shameful Death, for the<br>horrid Crime of taking away the Life of my fellow Creature, which was oc-<br>casioned by my going into the Company of the Corporal and his Wife, who<br>were both Drunk at the Time; so being easily perswaded to sit down with<br>them, which is the Cause of shortning my Days, and that Day being a remarkable<br>Day, for I was not out of the House till I was ordered to go to the Burial of one of<br>my Commerads, being imployed all that Day in reading some devout French Books, and<br>not being very well that Day nor desireous to Drink ; so after that we went to ano-<br>ther House, but came Home in good Time, and drank two Pints of Ale, then I got<br>my Candle lighted and was going to Bed, so he and the Land-lord would have more<br>Drink, then went into his Room. A little after he was going to the Door, they all de-<br>sired him to stay in the House, but he would not, so he went and fell out with these<br>People, but which Way I know not, for the Land-lord and his Wife was in the Room<br>with me, so a little after one called me by my Name, and said there was a Man<br>slaughtered, so I went to the Door to see what the Matter was, and seing one of<br>them beating him, asked what the Matter was, and some of them said then. was an-<br>other of the Rascals, and that Man saying something of the Black-guard, and gave<br>me worse Language than the rest, likewise the Mob coming closser upon me, and he<br>going to assault me, I pushed at him to keep my self free from him and the Mob, but<br>did not think to do him any harm, but the Devil, which is always ready, did assist to<br>that unhappy thrust.<p>I was born in Ireland of honest Parents, in the County of Antrim, and was brought<br>up in the Faith of the Church of England, and entered the Service at 15 Years of<br>Age; but, Alas.! has been an unworthy Member, and acknowledges I never saw<br>that Man before, nor had no Malice against him, nor did design to wound him,<br>far less kill him, but only to keep him and the Mob off me; and does believe<br>some of the Mob threw him on my drawn Bayonet, and am not sensible how the<br>Wound was given, being in an Hurry in the midst of the Mob,and heard the Desunct<br>say, He has wounded me, and immediately went home to Bed, and, mounted the<br>Guard next Day, not expecting any Danger; and see'd the Desunct come up to my<br>Room a little after he had got the Wound, and said I was no the Man ; But,<br>Alas! I was the unhappy Instrument ; for he neither knew me nor I him, never<br>having seen other before.<p>I was married in July 15th last, to one Elizabeth Macdonald, of  honest Parents<br>at lnverness, who has been a good Wife to me, and has contribute much to my<br>Spiritual Comsort in this my Extremity, and recommends her to the Conduct and<br>Assistance of GOD Almighty, and all his good People, she being with Child, and<br>far from her own Friends.<p>I die in perfect Peace with all Men, forgiving the World, as I expect Forgiveness<br>of GOD Almighty, through Jesus Christ my only Redeemer. I own the Justness<br>of my Sentence, and the Return of the Verdict; and the Kindness of the Judges<br>in giving me some little Time to prepare my self for that great Journey. Likeways<br>I have been very much bound to the Ministers of Edinburgh, who were not deficient<br>in visiting me, and assisting me with their Prayers. I likeways beg the Aid and As-<br>sistance of all good Christians in their Prayers to GOD for me. Unto thy Hands<br>O LORD I recommend my Soul and Spirit.<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Save me  O  mv  REDEEMER.<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Neil Cordey.<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;EDINBURGH, Printed by Robert  Brown, 1719.</p>
