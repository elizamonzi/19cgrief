The Author begs leave to submit the following as a specimen :?Extracted from<br>the Edinburgh Literary Journal, dated Jan. 24, 1829?" It seems a work of inestimable<br>value."<br>The Work is embellished with a striking Portrait of Jamie.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To be had of the Author,<br> W. SMITH, 3 Bristo Port, and several Booksellers in Town and Country.</p>
