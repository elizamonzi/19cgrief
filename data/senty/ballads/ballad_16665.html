	<p> THE<br>LAST&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;W OR D S<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;OF<p>JOHN KNOX,<p>Who was Shot in the North-Inch of PERTH the 24th of AUGUST&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>1716, about 7 in the Morning.<p>MY Friends and Country-men, being in a Few Minutes to appear be-<br>fore GOD's Tribunal to give Account of the Deeds done in the<br>Body ; and apprehending that those who are to oversee the Execution of the<br>Sentence against me, will not allow me to speak my Mind freely, I leave this<br>Paper to be published after my Death : And in Case it be kept up or de-<br>stroyed, I  have left another Copy with a Gentle-woman in Town, who, I'm<br>confident, will cause publish it, since it is the Desire of a Dying Man.<p>With Shame and Sorrow, I acknowledge that I am a great Sinner,<br>and that I have offended GOD in Thought, Word and Deed; yet I Trust<br>there is Mercy for me, as for all other Penitents, thro' the Merits and Medi-<br>ation of my blessed Saviour. I heartily forgive all my Enemies, as I desire<br>Forgiveance at the Hand of GOD.  Tho' the LORD's Prayer is, by many,<br>much neglected, and the Use of it in a great Measure abolished, I cannot but<br>highly esteem it. As to that Part of it which concerns the pardoning of Injuries<br>done to me, I will say it with my Last Breath, and I thank GOD that I can,<br>with all the Sincerity of the World say, That from the Bottom of my<br>Heart I freely forgive all Men as I desire to be forgiven of GOD.<p>I bless GOD I suffer for well doing, for asserting  the Right of my only,<br>Rightful Soveraign K. JAMES the VIII. and endeavouring to relieve my<br>miserably oppressed Native Country. My Prosecutors tell me, It is  for my<br>Desertion of the Camp at Stirling, and they alledge, tho' they have not made,<br>it appear, that I joined the Kings Army, whom they call Rebels ; and that<br>I was with the Duke of MAR in Perth all Winter. My wretched<br>Prison-keeper who is turned so violent on the Usurping-lay, says, He has it<br>from those be calls honest Men : But from him, and all such as he is, good<br>LORD deliver all good Christians.<p>Now, to satisfy my Prosecutors and others, I acknowledge I served under<br>the D. of Brunswick for sometime, but with the greatest Reluctancy ; and<br> when Conscience could no longer endure the Violence done to it,I joined the<br>King's Army that went to Preston, where the King's Interest was ruined,<br>and many a brave Man was betrayed out of Life and Fortune; for I think my<br>self bound to tell them, that I reckon there was Treachery as well as Cowar-<br>dice in some who had the chief Command there. I heartily wish all of them<br>may Repent and Amend. It has been said, that some of those who carried<br>on the Union got the Repentance of Judas ; but I heartily Pray that all who<br>are hired  to Support the D. of Brunswick on the Throne, denying and re-<br>jecting their true Master and Sovereign may get Peter's Repentance, who de-<br>nyed his.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  For I am fully persuaded that till our Natural and Rightful So-<br>vereign is in the settled and peaceable Possession of his just Right, and the<br>Principles of Whiggery, which destroy all Order and Government, are extirpa-<br>ted ; Peace will never flourish in Britain which I pray GOD may forward.<p>I am the second Sacrifice in this Place for King JAMES the VIII. I Pray<br>GOD I may be the last, and that of His Infinite Mercy He may put a Stop to<br>the Bloodshed and Murder of these Times.<p>Since it is GOD's Will that I am deprived of my Life, I hope to glorify<br>GOD by my Death, which I shall suffer chearfully, since roved away in the<br>23d Year of my Age for my King and Country.<p>I pray GOD may preserve the King, and that He may always Bless him,and<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; all the Endeavours and Enterprises for his Restauration;That God may encrease<br>the Number of his true Subjects, and convert all the Enemies of our King<br>and Country.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Being now to recommend my Self to GOD by Prayer, I<br>bid you all Adieu.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  sic Subscribitur,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;JOHN&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;KNOX.</p>
