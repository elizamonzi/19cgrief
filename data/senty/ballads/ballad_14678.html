	<p> FORTY WHITEBOYS SENTENCED<br>TO&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;DEATH!!<p>An Account of the Proceedings of the Special Commission at Cork<br>for the Trials of the Whiteboys, when nearly FORTY unfor-<br>tunate Human Beings received the awful sentence of Death; se-<br>veral of whom were ordered for Execution on Monday last 25th day<br>of Feb., 1822, and their bodies to be given for Dissection.<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;CORK, FEBRUARY 18.<p>THIS day, at nine o'clock,the Judges M'-<br>Clelland  and Moore, came into Court,<br>which from an early hour, was crowded to ex-<br>cess in all parts by persons of the highest re-<br>spectability.<p> Fourteen men were put to the bar, charged<br>with having at Carriganisi, in this county, on<br>the 24th day of January assembled illegally in<br>company with some other persons, and hav-<br>ing fired a gun at the liege subjects of the<br>King. The Jury found the following ten pri-<br>soners guilty?D. Murphy, D. Reardon, Pa-<br>trick Lehane, Pat. Breen, T. Gogg n, Corne<br>lius Buckley, Cornelius Lucy, Jerem. Hurley,<br> Humphry Hincy, and J. Kellaher. Four were<br>acquitted.<p>The Court met again on Tuesday, when o-<br>ther fifteen men were brought before them,<br>charged with having assembled with arms on<br>the 25th of January last, near Macroom, and<br>with having fired on two of the Magistrates.<br>The Jury returned a verdict of Guilty against<br>twelve of the prisoners.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<p>On Wednesday the Court continued its sit-<br>tings, when eight more were convicted under<br>the Whiteboy Act.<p>On Thursday J. Leary and G. Cotter were<br>found guilty of compelling T. Evans to deliver<br>up a sword. The wounded appearance of E-<br>vans excited expressions of horror and pity<br>from all present, and shewed the barbarity<br>with which he had been treated. He was<br>borne into Court, and supported whilst giving<br>his evidence. D. Cronin, E. Brien, were<br>found, guilty of unlawfully assembling on the<br> 21st of Jan last, and firing on the Earl of Ban-<br>try and several Magistrates, at the head of a<br>civil and military force. Cronin was recom-<br>mended to mercy; being subject to fits.<p>On Friday, Cornelius Rylahan, John Ma-<br>hony, and Daniel Bryan, were found guilty of<br>aiding in the murder of Hugh Cologan, on the<br>31st of January last, when the Churchtown<br>barracks were burned by a party of the White-<br>boys, and two police officers murdered. Mr.<br>Justice Moore then proceeded to pass sentence<br>upon them, which he did with solemn effect,<br> and ordered them for execution on Monday<br>last(25th Feb.,) and their bodies to be dis.<br>sected and anatomised.<p>When the Jury who tried the last case were<br>deliberating on their verdicts the several pri-<br>soners who had been convicted during the Com-<br>mission, were brought to the bar, to be sen-<br>tenced, which painful duty was performed by<br>Baron M'Clelland, with an impressive solem-<br>nity which, it, is to be hoped,reached the hearts<br>of those to whom it. was immediately addressed<br>with as much effect as it did those of the au-<br>ditory. Towards the conclusion of his ad-<br>dress, the Learned Judge intimated that a se-<br>lection had been made of the cases of the pri-<br>soners, that some of there were to undergo at<br>an early day the ignominious end to which<br>their crimes had brought them, while the  ex-<br>istence of the others would be prolonged to a<br>more distant day, and if in the interval tran-<br>quillity was restored, a perfect change effected<br>in the disposition and conduct of the peo-<br>ple, and a surrender of arms, mercy may be<br>extended to them; but if there were not these<br>demonstrations of returning peace and tran-<br>quiliity, their doom was certain The Baron<br>then proceeded to pass the awful sentence of<br>the law on the thirty-two persons who had<br>been capitally converted, intimating that the<br>recommendation of the Jury as to three of them<br>would be transmitted to the proper quarter.<p> The last lrish Papers we lament to say, fur-<br>nish more than the usual number of atrocities,<br>and among them is to be found one care of<br>such preeminent wickedness, such unmanly<br>and beastly barbarity, as proves that the sa-<br>vages of Munster have not only renouncod the<br>laws of their country and their God, but have<br>divested themselves of the frist instincts of the r<br>nature. They carried off nine of the wives,<br>belonging to the Soldiers of the Rifle Brigade<br>and violated the whole of their persons. The<br>wars of the Cherokees and Osages, of North<br>America, or the Malays or Dahomians of A-<br>frica, furnish no parallel for th s loathsome -<br>bomination, before which murders and house-<br>breakings rise into comparative innocence.?<br>Nothing could equal the feelings of the injured<br>and incensed soldiery; and but for the lauda-<br>ble persuasions of their offices, the retributive<br>consequences might have been dreadful.<p>John Muir, Printer. Glasgow.</p>
