	<p> HUZZA !<p>FOR<p>PROVOST  SPITTAL !!!<p>AN EXCELLENT NEW SONG.<p>Tune?" THE ARETHUSA."<p>I..<p>YE Whig Reformers all draw near,<br>To Aytoun's trash ne'er lend an ear,<br>But join with me in a counter cheer-<br>Huzza for Provost Spittal!<br>To hear what Aytoun's friends advance,<br>You'd think the other had no chance,<br>And that he was as snug<br>As a flea in a rug,<br>But take my word it's all humbug,<br>And that Aytoun first must have a tug<br>For the Provostship with Spittal.<p>II.<p>For if the voters you inspect,<br>A great distinction you'll detect,<br>And those are much the most select<br>Who give their votes to Spittal.<br>The Aytounites, we all must feel,<br>Are really not at all genteel?<br>But horrid low,<br>From the Cowgate and Bow,<br>St Mary's Wynd and the Potterrow?<br>Where respectable Whigs would never go<br>To canvass even for Spittal.<p>III.<br>A Haberdasher though he be,<br>Yet Aytoun knows he's as good as he-<br>A Lawyer who ne'er touched a fee<br>Must not compare with Spittal.<br>And Spittal too has lately bought,<br>In Berwickshire, a pretty spot,<br>Called Justice Hall,<br>At which, though small,<br>He'll be very proud to see you all,<br>If you'll favour him with a morning call,<br>Whene'er he's Provost Spittal.<p>IV.<p>And though Aytoun jokes at Spittal's shop,<br>It's far too good a thing to drop,<br>And now must needs be quite tip-top<br>When he is Provost Spittal.<br>So all of you, some afternoon,<br>Just step to the sign of the gold balloon,<br>Where, I dare to say,<br>You'll get away<br>Some ribbon or silk for a holiday,<br>Which, out of your thousand a-year, he'll pay.<br>If you'll cheer for Provost Spittal.<p>V.<p>And what's this mighty fuss we hear<br>About a thousand pounds a-year-?<br>It  would be cutting much too near<br>To grudge that sum to Spittal.<br>For though the Old Town Council's up.<br>The New one still must dine and sup ;<br>And much depends<br>On what he spends<br>To enable the Provost to gain his ends,<br>By giving a snack to his good Whig friends.<br>That vote along with Spittal.<p>VI.<p>It would indeed be mighty hard,<br>If the Whigs should lose their just reward,<br>And all their prospects now be marr'd,<br>By Aytoun beating Spittal.<br>Reform's not worth a single fig,<br>Unless it serve to help a Whig ;<br>With much ado,<br>They carried it thro'<br>For themselves alone, and not for you,<br>You vile and low-bred Radical crew,<br>That refuse to vote for Spittal.<p>VII.<p>Then Whig Reformers, one and all,<br>Up with the Laird of Justice Hall,<br>And down with every Radical<br>That will not vote for Spittal.<br>The Tories now are fairly down,<br>And Whigs alone must rule the town ;<br>So never fear,<br>Though Aytoun may jeer,<br>When it comes to the scratch he'll disappear?<br>So Reform for ever and the thousand a-year,<br>And huzza for Provost Spittal!!<p>Waugh, Printer, Edinburgh.</p>
