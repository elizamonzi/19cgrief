	<p> EXECUTION<p>OF THE GILMERTON<p>MURDERERS,<p>DOBIE AND THOMSON.<p>A Full, True, and Particular Account of the<br>Execution of David Dobie and John Thom-<br>son, for the Murder and Robbery of Mar-<br>garet Paterson, near Gilmerton, on the<br>night of Saturday the l7th of April, 1880,<br>and who, in pursuance of the Sentence of<br>the High Court of Justiciary, were hanged<br>at the head of Libberton's Wynd, Edin-<br>burgh, on the morning of Wednesday the<br>18th August, 1830, and their bodies after-<br>wards given to Dr Monro, for public dissec-<br>tion.<p>The Execution of these two unfortunate<br>men took place this morning, Wednesday the<br>18th August, on the scaffold erected for the<br>purpose, at the head of Libberton's Wynd.<p>The enormous, unheard of Crime of which<br>the unhappy culprits were convicted, is set<br>forth, in so far as due regard to public decen-<br>cy permits, in the following abstract of the<br>Indictment on which the prisoners were<br>tried and found guilty : ?<p>That albeit, by the laws of this and every<br>other well governed realm, Rape; as also As<br>sault, more especially when committed with<br>intent to Ravish ; as also Murder ; as also<br>Robbery ; are crimes of an heinous nature, and<br>severely punishable : yet true it is and of ve-<br>rity, that you the said John Thomson and<br>David Dobie did, both and each, time afore<br>said, at or near the part of the road, &c. &c,<br>wickedly and feloniously attack and assault<br>the said Margaret Paterson, and did strike her<br>several severe blows with your fists, and kick<br>her on the head and sides, and other parts of<br>her body, whereby she was rendered insensi-<br>ble, and did?[Here again the words of the<br>indictment are unfit for publication. They<br>describe particularly the soul harrowing atro-<br>cities of the monsters, in forcing into the bo<br>dy of their already brutally maltreated and<br>insensible victim, three rough cornered pieces<br>of stone a number of small pieces of coal, a<br>quantity of coal dust, a quantity of hay, and<br>the bone of the corsets of the deceased !!!<br>or some other instrument unknown. And<br>having mentioned the dreadful lacerations and<br>wounds thus produced, the indictment went<br>on]? Of the injuries so inflicted, or of one or<br>other of them, the said deceased Margaret<br>Paterson languished till her death : LIKEAS<br>the said John Thomson and David Dobie did,<br>both and each, or one or other of you, time<br>aforesaid, &c. &c., wickedly and feloniously<br>rob the said deceased Margaret Paterson, and<br>did take from her by force and violence, a<br>small tin box, two pawn tickets for gowns,<br>one pledged for 8s. 6d. and the other for 4s,<br>the more particular description of the said<br>pawn tickets being to the prosecutor unknown,<br>8s. 6d. or thereby in silver money, a key, a<br>checked cotton or muslin handkerchief, a<br>green shawl, a coarse towel, some pieces of<br>card or pasteboard, and some pieces of bread<br>and meat being all the property or in the<br>lawful possession of the said deceased Marga-<br>ret Paterson.<p><p>The behaviour of the Prisoners in jail, since<br>their condemnation, has been generally peni-<br>tent and  resigned. The following letter, said<br>to have been written by Dobie to his wife,<br>breathes a  spirit perfectly becoming a man in<br>his  awful situation.<p>"Dear Wife- I write these lines to you,<br>hoping you may receive some consolation from<br>them. This is the only comfort that I can be-<br>stow, to let you know the state of my mind ;<br>although my guilt does stare me in the face,<br>I trust God will be merciful to me a humble<br>penitent; although my hands are stained with<br>the blood of the innocent, I trust the blood of<br>Christ will wash me from all my guilt.<p>" I am quite resigned to my fate; I forgive<br>all mine enemies, and I trust they will also<br>forgive me ; I die in peace with all men. You<br>will not have the melancholy satisfaction of<br>laying my body in the dust; but I beg as a<br>last request that you do not grieve on that<br>account, as these dry bones may yet live to<br>future glory, where man cannot scatter.<br>Shew this letter to the aged father of Mar-<br>garet Paterson, whose hoary head we have<br>brought with sorrow to the grave. We sin-<br>cerely implore his forgivenness, which is a<br>poor consolation for the loss of a daughter he<br>held so dear, which, by our wicked hearts has<br>left him to bewail the loss of a child, and you<br>a faithless husband.<p>" Give my last respects to all my friends<br>and comrades, and to the grace of God I leave<br>them and you for ever.?Farewell."<p>The Prisoners were brought over from the<br>Calton Jail to the Lock-up house, exactly at<br>a quarter past five o'clock last night. They<br>were dressed in shabby blue coats, the same<br>as they wore during their trial, and they<br>looked very dejected, and pale,?the colour<br>having forsaken the cheeks even of Dobie.<p>During the night, the unhappy men spent<br>a considerable time in devotion, and they ex-<br>pressed themselves to be as resigned to their<br>fate, as they were apparently penitent.<p>At the usual hour of eight o'clock in the<br>morning, the dismal procession  moved from<br>the Lock up-house to the Scaffold.<p>SECOND EDITION.<p>Further Particulars of their behaviour on<br>the Scaffold.<p>The Rev. Dr Lee gave out the 40th Psalm,<br>in which both Dobie and Thomson joined<br>with firm and clear voices. Thomson was the<br>image of perfect resignation?composed, tran-<br>quil, and seemingly even satisfied. Dobie was<br>as usual restless, and looked frequently round<br>him at the people. He had recovered his colour<br>since last night.<p>After the Psalm was sung, the Rev. Dr Lee<br>made a long and impressive prayer, fervently<br>imploring the divine blessing and mercy on<br>the assembled multitude, and more especially<br>on the unhappy culprits whose lives were for-<br>feited to the outraged laws of their country.<br>Some parts of the Reverend Doctor's prayer<br>fixed Dobie's attention, in spite of his restless-<br>ness.<p>After the conclusion of the prayer, the<br>wretched men were placed on the drop, The<br>rope was first adjusted round the neck of<br>Thomson, who immediately began to pray<br>fervently in a loud distinct voice. He was<br>evidently wholly engrossed in devotion.<br>Dobie continued to talk earnestly and with<br>his usual restlessness to those around him for<br>some time.<p>When the rope was at length put round<br>Dobie's neck,?he also began to pray loudly<br>and fervently, many times repeating, ' O,<br>Lord, have mercy on our souls !' and trembl-<br>ing just before this, he had asked for and<br>drunk about half a tumbler of water.<p>At length, he cried out to Thomson, ' Are<br>you ready '?' Yes,' was the answer, as soon<br>as Thomson was sufficiently roused from the<br>abstraction of his devotion to hear him. They<br>then cordially shook hands with one another,<br>and Dobie, who held the signal, threw it<br>down, and they were launched into eternity<br>a little before half past eight o'clock.<br>Both the wretched men struggled for about<br>four minutes.<p>There was an immense concourse of specta-<br>tors<p>After hanging the usual time, the bodies of<br>the malefactors were cut down, to be deliver-<br>ed for dissection, in pursuance of their sen-<br>tence.<p>FORBES and OWEN, Printers, 115 High Street.</p>
