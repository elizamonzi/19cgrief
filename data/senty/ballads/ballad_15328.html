	<p> TRIAL  AND&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ACQUITTAL.<p>The Trial of  Mr James Stuart  who was  tried at<br>the High Court of  Justicary, for beings art and part<br>in a duel in which Sir&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alexander Boswell&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;lost his<br>life, and after a  trial of 18&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;hours&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;he  was&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;acquited<br>from the Bar<p>THE Trial of Mr James Smart came on this day. (Monday,<br>10th June,) before the High Court  of Jucticiary.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The<br>Indictment having been reard, the Lord Justice Clerk then ask-<br>Mr Stuart whether he was guilty---answered " My&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lord&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I  am<br>not guilty, "  Mr Cockburn, then made an eloquent and impres-<br>sive speech, in which he fully denied all the charges&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;in the in-<br>dictment ; And  on Mr Cockburn adverting to the death of Sir<br>A. Boswell, Mr Stuart seemed very murch affected Mr Cock-<br>burn said, there was not a  friend the&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;deceased had  felt such<br>poignant anguish at his heart.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He concluded  by saving, that<br>Mr Stuart acted under a moral necessity; and that a verdict of<br>not guilty would be most grateful  to humnilty and  most con-<br>sistent with the laws.<p>Solicitor-General.?As no objections had been stated  to the<br>relevancy of the indictment, he had not to slate in reply.<br>Earl Rosslyn was the first witness called.<p>Soliciter General.? Are you acquainted with the gentleman<br>at the bar? he answered I&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;am, and  then  went on to state at <br>great length and with much  perspiicuity;  all the circumstances<br>connected with it,<p>Honouroble John Douglass.?1 was acquainted with Sir A.<br>Boswell. In the month of March I attended him to an niter-<br>view with Lord Rosslyn. The interview was in the Waterloo<br>Hotel. I went with Sir A. into a room where the Earl of Ross-<br>lyn was was, and he held in his hand, I think, two papers. Lord<br>Rosslyn mentio ed, that he had called this meeting upon a very<br>unpleasant business?those papers were copies? that a frind of<br>his obtained possesson of the originals, which contained obnoxi-<br>ous passages as to Mr Stuart's character.<p>Dr Wood.? On the 26th March last. Sir Alexander Boswell<br>called upon the deponent;?he requested my professional at-<br>tendence ;? he left my house, and returned soon after ;-?I Then<br>accompanied him and Mr Douglas in a carriage to Queensferry<br>afterwards to the village of Auchertool. We then proceeded<br>to the ground. Mr Stuart and Lord Rosslyn were upon, the<br>ground also. Lord Rosslyn desired me to remain at sorne space<br>of ground, But I went forward?I heard the discharge of the<br>pistols. Mr Listen and I turned our backs for the purpose of<br>not seeing, when we turned round, upon hearing the fire, we<br>saw Sir Alexander had fallen?we ran and found that the ball<br>had entered the middle of the right clavicle. Two bones were<br>exstracted on the spot, the first by myself, and the second by<br>Mr Liston. It was my opinion from the first that the wound<br>was mortal, Sir Alexander said in the course of the journey,<br>that he was determined to fire in the air.<p>Mr Liston.?Mr Stuart called upon the deponent to go to<br>the country along with him. And  when on Fife side, he in-<br>formed him, he was to fight a duel with Sir Alexander Boswell.<br>Mr S. said he had no malice against Sir Alexander: he said, if<br>he had the misfortune to hit him, he wished it might be on the<br>great toe, as a gentleman in  England did lately on a similar oc- <br>casion.  The deponent gave the same evidence as Dr Wood.<p>Mr Thomas Allan, banker.? Deponent heard of duel shortly<br>after it happened. He saw Mr Stuar at Calias. Mr Stuart ask-<br>ed deponent what news. I said the news were bad for him?<br>then says he, Sir A. is dead, When I told him that was the<br>case, he burst into tears and was much agitated.<p>Mr Walker (a tutor in Sir A.'s family)--I am tutor to Sir James<br>Boswell. I have been tutor in the family for several years and<br>knew Sir A Boswell. I think the hand-writing of the Whig<br>Song is not Sir A. nor that of any of the family. The address<br>seems to be the same with the rest.<p>The Lord Justice Clerk said the Jury would weigh all thes <br>tircumstances seriously in their minds, they would give a verdict<br>consonant to he he dictates of their own conscience, aud, if in<br>this case they were nnabled to come to a decided and clear<br>opinion, the advantage and privilege of that doubt belonged to<br>the gentleman at the Bar. The Jury chocse Sir John Hope,<br>Bart as their Chancellor ; and after consulting for a few minutes<br>in the Jury box the chancellor delivered an unanimous verdict<br>Not Guilty.  The verdict was received with loud cheers.</p>
