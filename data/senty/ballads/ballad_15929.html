	<p> FEMALE FOOT BOY!<p>An account of the Extraordinary Life and Adven-<br>tures of Catherine Wilson, an interesting young<br>woman, about twenty years of age, daughter of re-<br>spectable parents, near Perth, who assumed man's<br>apparel at the age of fourteen, and hired herself to a<br>drover, when she came to Edinburgh, and got into a<br>respectable gentleman's family as foot boy, but being<br>discharged was compelled to work as a bricklayer's<br>labourer ; how she assumed the name of John Thom-<br>son, and married her landlady's daughter, Mary Gray,<br>and on Saturday last resumed her petticoats.<p>A young woman, of the name of Catherine Wilson, a native of Perth, had,<br>it appears by her own account, assumed the dress of a boy between six and<br>seven years ago. She states that, on the death of her parents she found herself<br>without protection, and this induce 1 her to put on a suit of her deceased brother's<br>clothes, and in the name of John Thomson to seek employment in that disguise.<br>She was then not quite fourteen of age, and engaged herself in service among<br>the graziers. About five years ago she came with a drove of cattle to Hallow<br>Fair, Edinburgh, when she left the employment of the graziers, and was engaged<br>as a helper in the stables of Mr Lawson, and she continued in his service<br>until she got promoted to a better situation in the establishment of J. Williams,<br>Esq., in whose family she continued for two years, as groom and foot boy.<br>Having, however, given some offonce to her employer, she was discharged, and<br>while out of place she followed job employment as a "lumper," at Leith, and<br>lodged at the house of a woman named Gray. By some accident this woman<br>became acquainted with her sex, and terrified the poor wench by telling her she<br>was liable to transportation for having gone about the country in male attire.<br>This Mrs Gray had a daughter named Mary who had become pregnant by a<br>butcher of that neighbourhood. The Grays, both mother and daughter then<br>proposed to this female John Thomson, that she should marry Mary  and father<br>the child, in order to conceal the shame of the unfortunate Mary, and to prevent<br>the compulsory disclosure of the real father. Poor John did not relish this<br>matrmonial engagement, quitted the place, and sought employment in Edin-<br>burgh.<p>At Edinburgh, she entered into the service of a bricklayer, nnd learned to<br>carry the hod with much dexterity, but there when she had obtained the good<br>will of her master, Mary's mother followed her with entreaties and threats, and<br>at last a letter from Mary herself, reproaching poor John with deserting the ob-<br>ject of his seduction, was sent in such a manner as to fall into tne hands of<br>John's employer, who discharged his servant for conduct so depraved. Now,<br>being assured that the father of the child would advauce a sum of money as an<br>outset, John Thomson at length consented, and the marriage ceremony was<br>actuallly performed about two years since in the church.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; John Thomson was,<br>not very easy in the character of a husband ; the promised dowry was never<br>paid, and poor John found it was no easy matter to maintain a wife and child<br>and wife's mother into the bargain. John left home, being very discounted. <br>Another young Thomson was about to make its appearance, and the parish<br>officers were very alert in their enquiries after the unhappy John. In fact the<br>poor girl declares that she should long ago have disclosed her sex had she not<br>been intimated by the threats of Mary's mother. However, it appears that last<br>week the parish officers had rendered the situation of aflairs extremely urgent,<br>and having made a countryman of her own her confidant, she procured female<br>habiliments, and on Satnrday last resumed her petticoats, and thus divorced<br>herself from her matrimonial troubles.<p>She is a stout, short, good-looking young woman, and states herself to be in<br>her twentieth year; but probably on account of her labourous occupation, she<br>looks four or five years older. She has gained from all her employers an excel-<br>lent character for industry, sobriety, and honesty. She left this with the in-<br>tention of going to Glasgow, in search of employment among the factories, which<br>will be more suited to her sex.<p>R. Reynolds, Printer 489 Lawnmarket, Edinburgh,</p>
