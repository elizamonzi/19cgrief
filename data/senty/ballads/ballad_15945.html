With  the curious evidence Of the other passengers<br>and guard, who were examined as witnesses. Damages laid at L.50.<p>(From the Glasgow Cornier of Saturday, May 10,  1823)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <p>PEGGY PRUDENCE, versus STEENY SLY.<p>THIS was an action to recover damages for<br>an  ged  theft  of a kiss, by Steeny Sly from<br>Peggy Prudence.<p>The  first  and principal issue set forth, that<br>the said Steeny Sly, while an outside passenger<br>on the Perth  and Glasgow Royal Mail coach,<br>on the  1st  April, 1823, about the hour of 12<br>did rob Miss Peggy Prudence  of a kiss, law-<br>fully  in  her possession, she at the time  having<br>her head  out of the window of her lodging in<br>the main Street of  St. Ninians, and the defend-<br>er on the top of the coach, which, from the<br>narrowness of  the street, came close to the<br>window, where the said Peggy Prudence was;<br>when the said Steeny Sly stole a kiss from<br>Peggy Prudence, to great loss and damage of<br>the Pursuer.?Damages laid at L.50<p>The case was opened by James Spinnet, Esq.<br>who, after an eloouent speech for the pursuer,<br>procceded to call his witnesses.<p>Peggy  Prudence. Depones that, on the day<br>libeled, as she was looking over the window<br>the Perth coach came past. when a young<br>gentleman, dressed in black, stretched out<br>his neck, and before she was aware, stole a<br>kiss from her, he was sitting on the to of the<br>the coach, is sure Steeny Sly is the person, as<br>she afterwards met him in Stirling; when, as<br>she thretatened  him with this  action, he wished<br>to rake up matters and return her the stolen<br>kiss.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  <p>Cross-examined by John Squeezer, Esq.  for<br>the defender. Never gave a kiss to  the defend-<br>er in her life; he tried to return the stolen one <br>at Stirling, bat she did not take it, saw him<br>afterwards  give it to her sister&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  <p>Lawrence Queer Guard to the Coach ;.saw<br>the young man kiss the  girl, he (the lad) stole<br>it; it did not appear to be given by the lass.<p>Cross-examined--Never stole a kiss in his<br>life. On being cautioned to take care what<br>he said, owned that at a time, he may have<br>stolen one, but is not a habitual stealer of<br>them; sometimes takes a loan of them as he<br>goes  through  St. Ninians, but always returns<br>them when he comes back?the street is very<br>narrow and the coach may at times have given<br>a jolt?the street is not inconveniently narrow <br>for him, as  it  is a pleasant thing to shake hands<br>with a friend from the window [&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;]<br>for delivering and getting parcers.<p>Mr. Ricardo said  he was a political econo-<br>mist.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Qa being  asked what he considered a<p>kiss was worth, answered, it depends on the<br>demand for that article?in London they can<br>be got at all prices.<p>Jn  C---k has dealt in kissing a'&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;his life ;<br>fin's them every expensive;wude consider a<br>gude kiss worth at least the sum  libelled,  has<br>bought kisses at a much higher rate.<p>Lord E-----e has had both in his young day<br>and lately, dealings  in kisses; thinks the sum<br>shown forth in the libel not too great<p>Here the proof closed for the prosecution.<br>Mr. Squeezer addressed the Jury in  an elo-<br>quent and able speech in behalf of the detend-<br>er.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He then called.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  <p>Jerry Whip, who was Coachman on  the  day<br>the kiss was alledged to have been stolen. re-<br>members it perfectly; the lad, the defender,<br>was very civil in him, had given him a dram<br>at Dumblane, being asked if the Street of St.<br>Ninians is inconveniently narrow, answered<br>that  it was the d?mn?st ugly, dirty hole of<br>a place he had ever drove through being<br>admonished to avoid profane swearing, beg-<br>ged pardon, but declared it would make any<br>driver in Christendom swear  like a Turk to<br>drive through such a place.<p>Cross-exmined--Is  sure the coach heeled<br>over, and the defender' face forced against the<br>pursuer's- the guard may think the street is<br>not inconvenient for him, but it is quite an-<br>other thing to drive four horses before you,<br>than for to toot on a horn at the back of the<br>coach.<p>Joseph  Hume. --Has not dealt much is kis-<br>ses; likes more substantial Articles; has enquir-<br>ed into the value of kisses in Stirlingshn.; has<br>found that a pound of sweeties, which costs<br>eighteen pence, will buy two and a half kisses,<br>which makes one kiss worth seven pence one-<br>fifth to a fraction.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  <p>Cross-examined.-?Learnt&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; his&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;arithmetic<br>from Coker.....knows two and two makes  four,<br>and how many beans it takes to  make five<p>The  Learned  Judge,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;LORD  HUMBIG.<br>WIG, summed up the evidence with his usu-<br>al ability and impartiality.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  <p>The&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;July, after having  retired for twelve<br>hours, brought in a verdict in favour of the&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>defender.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<p>Counsel for the Plaintiff, Jas.
