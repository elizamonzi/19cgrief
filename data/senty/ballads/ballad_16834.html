	<p> Execution<p>A full and particular account of the Execution of<br>James Brown,  and John  Craig, who suffered <br>the last sentence of the Law in  front of the <br>New  Jail&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of Paisley,  for&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Breaking into the<br>House of Mr. Robertson at Foxbar, and stealing <br>a quantity of Property and ill using the in- <br>mates; also an account of their behaviour since <br>their trial and at the place of Execution.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <p>An Execution in Paisley is a circumstance of very rare oc- <br>currence, and may consequently be supposed to excite a much <br>deeper degree of interest, than in those places where they are <br>regularly witnessed from time with little space between. In <br>1765, Provan was executed at  Gallowsgreen  of Paisley, for <br>the murder of his wife under circumstances of deep and ag-<br>gravated atrocity; since that time down to the present, a <br>period of 64 years, there has been in this town, only one of <br>these&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;melancholy&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;awful  lessons  to&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;erring  humanity.<br>This was the final exit of Thomas Potts who was executed at <br>the cross, (the former place of execution having been appro- <br>priated to other purposes,) in  1797 for housebreaking and <br>theft, this man, with an accomplice, were tried for the rob-<br>bery of Gryffe Castle, in the neighbourhood of Paisley, when <br>Potts was found guilty, condemned, and executed, as above <br>mentioned, since which the Gallows on which Potts ended his <br>career would have remained unemployed, had it not been re- <br>quired by the town of Greenock for a similar purpose, from <br>whence it has  been removed for the execution of these two <br>unfortunate men, James Brown and John Craig, who were <br>this day in pursuance of their sentence suffered the awful <br>penalty of the law. These two men we understood are na- <br>tives of Ireland, but have for some years been  resident in <br>Johnstone, when the affair for which they suffer was concoc- <br>ted, and which  place they left shortly after its perpetration <br>in order to evade the hands of Justice. They were however <br>both seized and brought to this country, and tried at the last <br>assizes where they were condemded for the crime of break- <br>ing into the house of Mr. Robertson of Foxbar. On  trial <br>it appeared that these two unfortunate men along with a per- <br>son of the name of Stewart (who was outlawed on the day of <br>trial,) had forcibly obtained entrance to Mr. Robertson who<br>is an old man upwards of 70 living with only his sister a <br>Lady of nearly the same age.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<p>Since their being brought from Glasgow these unfortunate <br>men have been regularly visited by Clergymen and other re- <br>ligious persons, and have evinced a deep feeling of contrition <br>for their crimes, giving every evidence of a repentance not to <br>be repeated of. In course of this forenoon they were brought<br>into  the Hall and  after some pious conversation and prayers, <br>they were brought out to the scaffold, dressed in a very beco- <br>ming and respectable manner, from their appearance they<br>were earnestly supplicating the almighty for pardon, and in <br>presence of a most immense multitude they were launched <br>into eternity.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ]<p>Owing to Glasgow fast happening on this day, the con-<br>course of people flocking into this town during the early <br>part of the forenoon was enormous while the influx from the<br>towns and villages in the west was no less numerous, presen- <br>ting as a whole one of the most immense crowds seen in this<br>place or any former occasion.<p>PRICE ONE PENNY.</p>
