	<p> OLD TOWN ZOOLOGICAL<p>SECOND ATTACK!<p>OF THE<p>Wild Beasts upon their Keeper<p>IN<p>THE ROYAL CIVIC ARENA,<br>ROYAL EXCHANGE, EDINBURGH :<p>showing how the Animals Fought and how their Keeper Defended<p>himself.<p> The House being crowded in every part to excess,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;hundreds,  eager  to  gain<br>admission, were reluctantly obliged to go away.<p>THE usual Overture was played by the Band in attendance; con-<br>cluding very appropriately, with the New Song of<p>Come you here the Fecht to see,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  <br>Or hear the fun wi' me, man !&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>Or saw you ever sich a den,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>As our Menagerie, man !&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  <p>THE Curtain then rose, displaying all the wild animals in diffe-<br>rent attitudes. The Grampus came forward, and announced that<br>he had been to the " first Weird" and engaged a Stut?the Hippo-<br>potatoe-tamus put them in mind that he was a Hooded Stut, and<br>would prove a very tractable and rare animal in the collection. The<br>Keeper then got him duly in-stalled; but contrary to all expectations,<br>he kicked and gored him the moment he was introduced. The<br>small ape,Genus Legal, who had been trained to perform at the<br>Bar of the Parliament Coffee-house, came forward to the front of<br>the stage. He seemed very sick, and cried for a pail of water,<br>which was instantly brought in. He said that he had been de-<br>puted by the rest of the animals to lead the attack, and to seize<br>upon, and gag the Keeper, a duty he was very unwilling to per-<br>form, but which he was obliged to attempt, in order to prevent<br>himself being torn to pieces by the more ravenous animals, (great<br>growling in the Menagerie). He tugged and drew, and like most<br>animals of his species, tried to make the worse appear the better<br>reason. But his logic seemed too big for his understanding, and<br>he was observed to take several awkward turns to recover his wits,<br> and make himself intelligible,?each attempt, however, only<br>served to make his case the more obscure. At last, he sat down<br>amidst the hisses of the audience, mingled with the growls of the<br>animals. Then the poor old chained rickety Fox, with a lean and<br>hungry look, presented himself, and called forth the com-<br>miseration of all present, from his ill-conditioned appearance and<br>inability,?not his unwillingness to shew his teeth and fight, for<br>he seemed as fierce and ravenous as ever.?But Genus Medic?,<br>always ready with his usual talent, came to the rescue, and<br>said, that the beasts who had already shown themselves, talked<br>of spliting hares, and putting their Keeper through the eye of a<br>needle, but that he was prepared to dissect the whole Mena-<br>gerie of wild animals, and to show by their different formations,<br>that it was their natural ravenous propensities and revengeful<br>dispositions, and not as they said, the honour of the Menagerie, that<br>had called forth this attack, and that they might rest assured that<br>the public would not suffer them to go howling after their Keeper<br>wherever he went, (great cheers by the audience), which was check-<br>ed by the Keeper, who said this noise only made the Animals the<br>more ferocious. Several wild animals, roused by the noise, grunted<br>and growled, and the Wright Hyena made an attempt to devour<br>a Miller who was near him, but he was secured, and chained up.<br>The Keeper remarked, that he had observed the poor Ourang-<br>Outang to be in labour for about a week- past, and fully expected<br>a whiskered production like itself; but lo, and behold ! he had to<br>tell the audience, that the only production of this week's labours<br>was a very small mouse, which the Fox and Ourang-Outang were<br>nursing between them?a natural curiosity, that must prove a<br>great attraction to the Menagerie. The attention of the audience<br>was then directed to a small whelp, the Son of Gib, who had been<br>reared in the Riccarton Kennel. It was expected to fight by the<br>side of the Keeper, but its toe had been severely tread on by the<br>Boot of the great Gulliver, and it could not show battle. The<br>Keeper said that the animals must now see that all their attempts<br>to injure him must recoil on their own heads, and make them<br>to be more securely caged up.<p>The Keeper then apologized for the crowded state of theTheatre,<br>which, he had no doubt, was caused by this extraordinary attack ;<br>but the animals had all promised to confine themselves, in future,<br>to their proper dens, and be peaceable. He therefore closed the<br>exhibition for the day, and said that the animals might go and<br>scratch themselves, which so delighted the Hippo-potatoe-tamus,<br>that he actually held out a foot to be shaken by the Keeper, in<br>token of future obedience, and that dignified functionary actually<br>condescended to handle him, amidst shouts of laughter from the<br>whole house. After which, the curtain dropt.</p>
