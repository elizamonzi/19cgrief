	<h2>Transcription</h2>
	<p> An account of  the Trial of Alexander Cain, alias O'Kane, before the  High Court of Jus-<p>ticiary, Edinburgh, for wounding severely on the bead, and other parts of the body,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Archi<br>bald Stewart, Cattle-dealer, while in Stirling, and robbing him of One Thousand and Ten<br>Pounds ster.?who was found guilty, and sentenced to be hanged, at Stirling, on Friday<br>the 21 st of February, 1812.<p>ON Monday the 13th of January, 1812, came<br>on, before the High Court of Justiciary, E-<br>dinburgh, the trial of Alexander Cain, alias O'Kane,<br>accused of having, on the evening of the 11th of<br>October, {the day on which Anderson and Menzics<br>were executed at Stirling, for robbery) with one or<br>more persons, attacked, in the town of Stirling,<br>Archibald Stewart, cattle-dealer in Dalspidle, who<br>had just arrived from Falkirk Tryst, where he had<br>received a sum of money; and of having struck and<br>wounded him severely on the head and other parts<br>of the body, to the effusion of his blood, and loss of<br>his senses for the time, and of robbing him of one<br>thousand and ten pounds sterling, chiefly in notes<br>of the Falkirk Bank Company.<p>The Jury being sworn in, the witnesses for the<br>Crown were then examined.<p>Sir.Thomas Kirkpatrick, Bart. Sheriff-Depute of<br>the shire of Dumfries, swore, that the notes of the<br>Falkirk Banking Company, exhibited, were taken<br>from the person of the prisoner, in a small public-<br>house in the town of Dumfries; some of them were<br>concealed near the waistband of his breeches; and<br> also, two twenty-pound notes,which he endeavour-<br>ed to conceal in his hand, while they were search-<br> ing him; and several others were found concealed<br>in the chimney of the room where he was.<p>Archibald Stewart, cattle-dealer, Dalspidle, not<br>being able accurately to understand the English lan-<br>guage, Mr. M'Intyre, a gentleman accidentally in<br>Court, who understood Gaelic, being sworn, acted<br>as interpreter:?Received L.9oo from Duncan Ca-<br>meron, in October last, L.770 in Mrs. M 'Kenzie's<br>tent, and L.7O in M'Nab's house in Larbert, all in<br>Falkirk twenty-pound notes and five-pound notes;<br>tied them up all together; he received, besides, two<br>drafts from Duncan Cameron, for L.200 each, and<br>a missive letter for another L.200; he left Larbert,<br>and arrived in Stirling about Dusk, but could not<br>say exactly about what hour; he put up at Henry<br>Abercrombie's, St. Mary's Wynd; dined there, and<br>afterwards went out by himself to see his horse sort-<br>ed; his money was in his waistcoat inside pocket,<br>and the drafts, &c. wrapped up in leather in his<br>coat pocket. Some other cattle-dealers were also<br>at Abercrombie's, and they having gone to the bank<br>to transact some business, after he had looked at his<br>horse he went to see and meet them; but not having<br>met them, he went into a house and had a dram; a<br>woman was in company; she merely tasted with<br>him, they  had no conversation. On his return,<br>while at an entry at the end of Abercrombie's house,<br>saw two or three men coming towards him; re-<br>ceived a severe blow on the crown of the head,<br>which stunned him; recollects the men taking the<br>money from him; one had his hand on his mouth,<br>another a hand on his neck, while the third said<br>"lay to him;" he thought he felt the man's hand<br>tremble while taking the money; does not recollect<br>the appearance of the men, it being dark, and he<br>stupisied by the blows, but thinks one of them was<br>a tall man. It was a considerable time before he<br>could find Abercrombie's honse; he went in, much<br>cut and bruised; got a Surgeon, and was consined<br>some days. Same night his leather parcel, con-<br>taining the drafts, was found by the Crieff post-boy,<br>and the following day he received it from Mr. Aber-<br>crombie; had been tasting during the day, but was<p>not intoxicated; it was the day two men were ex-<br>ecuted for theft at Stirling.<p>Some witnesses proved Stewart's getting, at the<br>Falkirk Market, on the 11th, the notes which were<br>afterwards found in the prisoner's posession.<p>Several witnesses were examined, who proved<br>that they saw the prisoner lurking about Stirling<br>the day the robbery was committed-that they saw<br>201. notes in his custody, and endeavoured to have<br>him seized, when he made his escape, and took the<br>road towards Dumfries.<p>Daniel Freer, cowfeeder at Lochrin, deponed,<br>that he met the prisoner on a Sunday in Oct. as he<br>was going to church in the afternoon, who asked<br>the way to Dumfries; said he would point it out if<br>he would come with him, as he was going to the<br>church; prisoner told him he had been in bad com-<br>pany, and had slept with a girl the night before,<br>who had robbed him of 449 guineas,, observing,<br>" You will perhaps think that a great sum for a man<br>like me to have, but I have a great deal more;" and<br>on this pulled out a large bundle of notes from his<br>breeches, and counted 700l. of large notes of the<br>Falkirk Bank. Witness, not liking his company,<br>after drinking share of a  gill, left him.<p>Samuel Gibson, serjeant of the police guard,<br>Dumfries. He apprehended the prisoner. Prison-<br>er said, if he would call on him next day he wished<br>to see him by himself; he did so, when the prisoner<br>said he wished he had given him 100 guineas the day<br>he took him to have let him make his escape; that<br>if there was no other person with him, he was cer-<br>tain, from his kindness to him, he would. Witness<br>replied, he might or he might not in that case, but<br>that now it was impossible, as there was another<br>man behind him. Prisoner said?" I think I could<br>trust you with a secret; if you would keep it, it<br> would make you up for life, and save me." Asked<br>witness if he would swear on a book, as was the<br>manner in his country; witness went out and told<br>this conversation to the jailer, who advised him to<br>do nothing against his conscience; on which he re-<br>turned and told the prisoner that it was not the cus-<br>tom to give books to two together in jail, but only<br>to allow one to a prisoner alone, to amuse himself.<br>He said, it was no matter, if witness would hold ,<br>up-his hand and swear, he might have L.400, all in<br>L.5O notes, in half an hour; that there was no<br>danger, as he might keep the money till the noise<br>was over, and then pass the notes one by one.--<br>Asked him, if it was part  of the money robbed from<br>the man at Stirling; on which he put his hand on<br>witness's breast, and. said, " Don't?don't ask that<br>question; you shall have an equal share, which will<br>come at L.140" Witness answered?he would try<br>to convey the money to him, But would take no<br>share. He immediately went to Provest Staig, and<br>informed him of what had passed. Sir T. Kirk-<br>patrick was in consequence sent for, and the prison-<br>er's room fearched, when a parcel, containing a-<br>bout L.340 in Falkirk L.5 bank notes, was found<br>concealed in the chimney. Saw the prisoner search-<br>ed, when the pocket-book and L.20 Falkirk bank-<br>notes were taken from him.<p>The evidence being finished, the sury were inclosed about half<p>pasT eleven night,and next day returned their verdict,all in one&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<p>voice finding the prisoner Guilty. After a suitable admonition<br>from the Lord Justice Clerk, he was sentenced to be hanged at<br>Stirling, os Friday the 21st Feb, next. [T, Duncan, Printer.</p>
