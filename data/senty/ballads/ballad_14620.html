	<p> HORRID<p>MURDER.<p>An Account of the Barbarous and Inhu-<br> man Murder of Mrs Franks and her<br> Daughter, with the Wonderful Manner<br> the Murders were discovered.<p>MRS FRANKS and her daughter resided in a remote<br>place at the village of the Abbey, near Haddington.<br>Upon the night of Wednesday the 28th of October,<br>1829, the above murder was committed in a most cruel<br>and diabolical manner, her throat was cut from ear to ear<br>with that of her daughter, a young girl only 14 years of<br>age; the body of the old woman was dragged into the pig<br>house. Mrs Franks was a widow, and had been at one<br>time in good circumstances of life, and at that period<br>was supposed to have money beside her, which it is<br>thought might have been the cause of this horrid murder,<br>which we can form no other idea of, in order to rob the<br>house, to which the mother and her daughter both fell<br>victims to-the hands of cruel monsters. Upon the fol-<br>lowing morning her son-in-law was apprehended, in con-<br>sequence of a strong suspicion excited against him, and<br>when he was examined he denied the charge with the<br>greatest firmness in the most solemn manner ; but he was<br>accordingly committed to the gaol of Haddington upon<br>the above charge, and from that recommitted to .Edin-<br>burgh. A few days ago a  travelling merchant with a<br>variety of goods was passing through the town, when a<br>young girl began to barter with him for a silk shawl, &<br>presented him with a gold seal, on which were engraved<br>two letters of a man's name. The merchant recognized<br>the seal which belonged to a brother of his, who was a<br>travelling merchant like himself, who was barbarously<br>murdered about six years ago; this struck the other<br>brother with astonishment, and being fully convinced<br>that the seal belonged to his brother, he soon concluded<br>the bargain with the greatest coolness and propriety, &.<br>immediately went his way and apprised Bailie Hay of<br>the circumstance, when a search warrant was granted, &<br>the house searched, when a number of goods was found<br>which he identified to be his murdered brother's proper-<br>ty, and amongst the rest a gold watch, which was proved<br>to be the property of the above Mrs Franks. The young<br>girl was instantly taken into custody, her father, John<br>Smith, and wife, was from home, but in the course of a.<br>few hours were apprehended and examined separately<br>upon both the murder of  Mrs Franks and her daughter,<br>with that of the merchant, but denied the whole of the<br>charges preferred against them, and refused answering<br>any farther questions to forward the examination. The<br>body of the above pedlar was found between Hadding-<br>ton and Linton, in a wood about six years ago, stripped<br>of every thing he possessed. A diligent enquiry was<br>made at the time as to this horrid murder, which proved<br>fruitless, but we trust now that both these atrocious deeds<br>are disclosed, so that the hand of Providence has various<br>ways of disclosing the deeds of the wicked to bring them<br>to a punishment they so justly merit.<p>Both Smith and his wife have long maintained bad<br>characters in this place, and it is but a short time ago<br>since they used a quantity of laudanum mixed in liquor,<br>and induced a traveller selling stocking yarn, to drink<br>of it in order to robe her. This has been their common<br>practice we understand for a number of years. We do<br>not pretend to say that Mrs Franks' son-in-law is not<br>guilty, but from the strongest of proofs that they are<br>both deeply connected. We are happy to state, not<br>doubting those to be the persons, that it will be satisfac-<br>tory to the public, and that the ruffians may meet that<br>pusishment they so justly merit.<p>Printed by T. Robertson, Haddington..</p>
