	<h2>Transcription</h2>
	<p> A full and particular Account of a most horrid Murder, committed on the Body  of<br>young Woman, at Ballinlick, in the District of Strathbraan, and parish of Little<br>Dunkelk, supposed to be perpetrated by her Sweetheart, a young Man of the Name<br>of Gow, who has been since apprehended, and committed to Perth Jail. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Perth, October 20,  1799.<p>DEAR&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SIR,<p>I Am greatly concerned to inform you, that our fa-<br>mily have been much shocked, a the  relation of<br>most bloody and inhuman murder, that was commit-<br>ted on the body of a respectable young woman, a few<br>days ago, at Ballinlick, in the district of Strathbraan,<br>and parish of Little Dunkelk, about  fifteen miles from<br>this place. The deceased is the daughter of Farmer<br>Brown of Ballinlick.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  <p>She had been for some time in terms of courtship<br>with a young man of the name of Gow, who resided<br>in that neighbourhood, and it is understood she had<br>made an appointment to meet with him on the even-<br>ing of Monday the 7th current.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<p>She went out of her father's house pretty late that<br>evening on a ptetence of discovering what the dog was<br>barking at, which, it is said, had been the agreed fig-<br>nal of meeting.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<p>As she did not return soon, her parents concluded<br>that she had gone over to a brother's house, who lived<br>in the neighbourhood, and therefore were under no<br>anxiety on accoont of her absence all night.<p>The next morning, however, to their equal sur-<br>prise and sorrow, they found her body in a well near<br>their own house, with marks of violence on her neck,<br>and belly, besides distinct  vestages of a person's teeth<br>on her right arm.<p>Gow being suspected of having committed this hor-<br>rid murder was apprehended on Thursday last, brought<br>to Perth, and committed to jail to stand his trial.<p><p>I Sincerely hope this melancholy affair will operate<br>as a proper warning to all young women; and tend to<br>make them conduct themselves in cases of courtship<br>with proper circumspection.<p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But, alas! not with standing every effort of parents<br>to prevent it, young women too often err in this re-<br>spect, and disregard all admonitions whatever; which,<br>if paid attention to in time, would secure their future<br>happiness.<p>It is lamentable to observe the fatal consequences<br>that often follow, when a young woman has once fixed<br>her affection on the man with whom she would wish<br>to be happy, and will not follow the instructions of<br>her parents; she thinks every remark, made for her<br>interest, meditates against her happiness, and never<br>perceives, till too late, she has acted wrong.<p>The infidelity of young men is but too conspicuous<br>in many instances relative to promises of marriage;<p>and, though there are daily proofs of the evil effects<br> of female credulity, yet, it still appears  evident that<br>it has very little influence upon the minds of the fair<br>sex in general.<p>It is to be hoped, that every young woman who<br>may hear of this cruel murder, will take care how<br>she cooducts herself during courtship; and however<br>strong her esteem and regard may be for the man she<br>has made choice of, not to make any appointments at<br>improper hours, nor unfrequented places; for it ap-<br>pears by this fatal catastrophe, and many others, that<br>the consequence often is the loss of Character, and,<br>alas! sometimes even Life. <p>DESCRIPTION OF DAMIETTA,<p>Damietta, or Damiat, a sea port town of Egypt, first<br>built at the eastern mouth of the Nile, and called Tha-<br>miatis, under the government of the Lower Empire.<br>Damietta is larger, and not less agreeable, than Ro-<br>setto?it forms a semicircle on easterrn shore of the<br>Nile, two leagues and a half from its mouth.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It con-<br>tains about 80,ooo inhabitants, and has several squares,<br>bazars filled with merchandize, okals, khans, under<br>the porticos  of which are  Indian stuffs, silks from<br>Mount&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lebanon, sal&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ammoniac, and quantites of <br>rice, be speak it a commercial place.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The houses, es-<br>pecially near the river, are very high; most of them  <br>have pleasant saloons built on the terraces, from which,<br>charming places, open, to every wind, there is a view<br>of the grand lake lying on the other side, and of the<br>Nile, which traverses a rich country between them<br>both. Various grand mosques with high minarets, or-<br>nament the city.?The public baths, faced with mar-<br>ble, are similar to those of Grand Cairo.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Multitudes<br>of boats and small vessels incessantly fill the port of.<br>Damietta.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Some, named  sherm, serve to load and<br>unload the ships that anchor in the road; others are<br>coasting pilot boats.?There is a great trade between<br>this city and Syria, Cyprus, and  Marseilles.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The<br>rice mezolaout, the finest of Egypt, is cultivated in<br>the neighbouring plains, and its annual exportationa-<br>mounts to  between&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;200,000 and 300,000 pounds.<br>There are likewise cloths, lal-ammoniac, wheat, &c.<br>Laws, ruinous to the country, prohibit the exportation<br>of the latter; but they are evaded, and it is passed as<br>rice.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Christians of Aleppo and Damascus, for<br>many ages established here, carry on the principa<br>trade; they are suffered to grow rich by Turkish in-<br>dolence, which contents it self with occasional extor-<br>tions.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Exportation of rice is forbidden, but by ar-<br>rangements advantageous to the receiver of thecustoms,<br>the people of Provence annually load several ships.<br>The thing most disadvantageous to the trade of Dami-<br>etta is its defective harbour; the road where vessels lie&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>being totally exposed.<p> Printed by Thomas Duncan, Glasgow.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  <p><p></p>
