	<h2>Transcription</h2>
	<p> Some Account of JOHN SHERRY, who was Executed in<br>of the New Jail of Glasgow, on Wednesday the 1st of No<br>ber, 1815, pursuant to his Sentence, for Highway Robbery<br>the road leading from Glasgow to Paisley, on the 19th May<p>JOHN SHERRY, who this day under-<br>went the sentence  of  the  law,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;was a<br>native  of Ireland,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;was  born in the<br>Country of  Monaghan. He was about 29<br>years of age, and  has  left a wife and five<br>children, the oldest of whom is  about seven<br>years  of age, to lament  his  untimely end.<p>He was put to the weaving business, but<br>left  his parents when little more than eight <br>years of age-a circumstance which he has<br>often regretted; for, after he left their pro-<br>tection, he soon fell a prey to bad company,<br>forsook his industry, went from  place to<br>place, and from one bad scene into another,<br>until he  committed the crime which this day<br>terminated his existence.<p>It is about ten years since he left Ireland,<br>and whether he worked at his trade in Scot-<br>land is a circumstance which could not be<br>learned-but it appears that he had recent-<br>ly fallen in with a set of bad men at Carlisle,<br>who were guilty of house-breaking, and one<br>of  whom was  apprehended and executed<br>for that  crime. Sherry was suspected of<br>being concerned in the affair, but, along<br>with others, made his escape. He was,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>however, afterwards apprehended at Glas-<br>gow, and remained in jail a week, when he<br>was sent off to Carlisle, under the care of a<br>Messenger, who came here for the purpose<br>of conducting him thither. The  mode of<br>conveyance was the top of the coach, the <br>inside being  full; but, on the road to Car-<br>lisle, Sherry complained that  he was in  great<br>pain, on account of his arms  being too hard<br>bound, and requested the Messenger to ease<br>the cords, in order that he might travel a <br>little more comfortably. This request be-<br>ing humanely complied with, and Sherry<br>now finding he could use his arms with con-<br>siderable freedom, watched an opportunity,<br>sprung from the top of the coach, and, be<br>fore the astonished Messenger could get<br>down, was out of sight, and succeeded in<br>making his escape.<p>He was no more heard of till he committed<br>the robbery on the Paisley road, in May last,<br>and for which he was apprehended at Glas-<br>gow, in June, and tried and condem[ned]<br>the last Circuit.<p>Shortly after his condemnation he [was]<br>very penitent, and seemed sincerely resig[ned]<br>to his fate. He was a Catholic and<br>carefully attended by the Re\ill\ Mr. S (?)<br>one  of the Clergymen of that persuas[ion]<br>but he made no objection, to converse<br>other pious Gentlemen, of a different<br>session, who waited on him.<p>Sherry was married when about ninete[en]<br>years of age, and seemed always to have<br>affectionate regard for his wife,who visited<br>him frequtently during his confinement.<p>A few days before his execution, he sent<br>for&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;his&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;wife's&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bible in order to mark<br>several portions of Scripture, which had<br>struck himself forcibly. The last interview<br>he had with his wife was a very affecting<br>one, and such as to excite the liveliest emo-<br>tions of sympathy.<p>He was very grateful for the humane at-<br>tention paid him by every person under<br>whose immediate care he was during his <br>confinement, often expressed himself to that <br>effect, and took an affecting farewel of them<br>previous to leaving the Jail.<p>It is hoped that the fate  of  this unfortun-<br>are young man will be a warning to the pro-<br>fligate, and open their eyes to a sense of the<br>dreadful situation they place themselves in<br>when they forsake the paths of honourable<br>industry to procure a wretched and ignoble<br>subsistence by robbing others on the public<br>highways.<p>Whenever a man feels himself inclined <br>to abandon  the course by which he can alone<br>come honestly through life, let him look to<br>the fate of Sherry, ignominiously cut off in<br>the very days of his youth; and let him re-<br>member, that the same awful fate awaits him,<br>when overtaken by the arm of justice,<br>which, sooner or later, never fails to reach<br>the guilty, and  convince&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;them that they<br>cannot possibly long exist by crime.<p>Printed by T. Duncan, 159, Saltmarket, Glasgow.</p>
