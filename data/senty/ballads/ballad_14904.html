	<p> BURNS AND HIGHLAND MARY.<p>In green Caledonia there ne'er were two lovers, <br>Sae enraptured and happy in each others arms,<br>As Burns the sweet bard and his dear Highland Mary And fondly and sweetly he sang of her charms. <br>And lang will his sang sae enchanting and bonnie<br>Be heard with delight on his dear native plains,<br>And lang will the name of his dear Highland Mary, <br>Be secred to love in his heart-melting strains.<p>O' twas a May day, and the flowers o' the simmer Were blooming in wildness a' lovely and fair;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>That our twa lovers mot in a grove o' green bowers Which grew on the banks of the clear winding Ayr. <br>And oh, to them baith 'twas a meeting fu' tender, As it was the last for a while the would hae?<br>Till the red setting sun showed the close o' the day. <br>Oh ! Mary, dear Mary, exclaimed her fond lover Ye carry my heart to the highlands with thee ;<br>Every burnie aud bank every grove and  green bower,<br>May talk o'the love o'my lassie and me;<br>My life's sweetest treasure my ain charming Mary, <br>To thee I'll be ever devoted and true ; <br>For the heart that is berring sae fast in this bosom, <br>The heart that can never love any but you. <br>Oh ! dinna bide lang in the Highlands my Mary. <br>Oh ! dinna bide lang in the Highlands frae me, <br>For l love these sincerely I love thee ow're dearly, <br>To be happy so far my dear Mary, from thee.<br>I winna bide lang my dear lad in the Highlands,<br>I canna bide lang for ye winna be there<br>Although I hae friends I like weel in the High ands,<br>The ane I love best's on the banks o' the ayr.<br>Then he kissed her red lips thev were sweeter than roses,<br>And he strained her lily-white breast to his heart,<br>And her tears fell like dew-drops at e'en on his bosom,<br>As she said my fond lover, alas! we maun part.<br>Then farewell ho said, an' he flew frae his Mary,<br>Oh ! farewell said Mary, she could sae nae mair ;<br>Oh ! little they kenned they had parted for ever,<br>When they parted that night on the banks o' the Ayr.<p>Yet the green summer saw but a few sunny mornings ,<br>Till she, in the bloom of her beauty and pride,<br>Was laid in her grave , like a bonny young flower,<br>In Greenock Kirk Yard, on the banks o' the Clyde ;<br>And Burns the sweet bard of his ain Caledonia,<br>Lamented his Mary in many a sad strain. <br>Ah ! sair did he weep for his dear Highland Mary, <br>And ne'er did his heart love sae deeply again. <br>Then bring me the lilies and bring me the roses, <br>And bring me the daisies that grow on the vale ;<br>And bring me the breath of the sweet seented gale,<br>And bring me the sigh of a fond lovers bosom,<br>And bring me the tear of a fond lovers e'e,<br>And I'll pour them down on thy gravo Highland Mary,<br>For the sake o'  thy Burns what owre dearly loved thee.<br>Moore, Printer, Cheapside, Belfast.</p>
