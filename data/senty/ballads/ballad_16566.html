	<h2>Transcription</h2>
	<p> An account of his Majesty's Embarkation for England, at the<br>Queensferry, on Thursday the 29th day of August, 1822<br>Also his Majesty's<p>Farewell Adress<p>to the Scottish Nation, which he ordered his Secretary to de-<br>liver to the Lords at Edinburgh, a short time before he left<br>that City.<p>HIS Majesty passed through Edinburgh on Thursday for Hopetoun House, amidst<br>the repeated and hearty cheers of his  subjects, escorted  by the West Lothian,<br>Yeomanry.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr. Sheriff Duff attended him to Cramond Bridge, to see his Majesty<br>out of his jurisdiction.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hopetoun House was graced with an assemblage of most of<br>the persons eminent for rank or abilities, in Edinburgh and West Lothian.<p>About four o'clock the bugles announced to the Archers that they were now to<br>take their station to bid adieu to the King. They formed on the stair, and the king<br>eyed them attentively, and bowed frequently as he passed to his carriage. The King<br>looked remarkably well, and was in the undress uniform. Cheers and blessings loud<br>and long attended his departure; they were cheers of joy at beholding their King,<br>and of regret for his departure. He then drove off for the Queensferry.<p>Previous to his Majesty leaving Edinburgh he ordered the following Letter to be<br>addressed to the Officers of State:?&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  " Edinburgh, August 29, 1822.<p>" My Lords?I have had the honour of receiving the King's commands to signify<br> to your Lordships his Majesty's unqualified approbation of all the arrangements which<br>have been made  preparatory to his Majesty's reception, and during his stay in Scotland.<p>" His Majesty is desirous of returning his particular acknowledgments to the se-<br>veral departments of the State, to the Local Authorities, and to those Societies and<br>Institutions which have so zealously co-operated with them in paying every mark of<br>respect and attention to his Majesty, and in promoting that perfect order, regularity,<br>and success, with which every ceremony has been conducted.  <p>" His Majesty commands me to add, that his residence in Scotland has proved to<br>him a source of unalloyed satisfaction. It has confirmed every favourable impression<br>which he previously entertained of the character and habits of the people; and it has<br>afforded to him that which must ever constitute his chief gratification, the opportu-<br>nity of witnessing the happiness of his subjects, and of receiving the most convincing<br>proofs of their faithful attachment and loyalty.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<p>" He takes leave of Scotland with the most cordial feelings of affection towards<br>his people, and with the deepest anxiety to promote their welfare.<p>" I have the honour to be with great truth and regard, My Lords, your Lord-<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ship most obedient and faithful Servant,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (Signed)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; " ROBERT  PEEL."<p>About four o'clock a gun announced that his Majesty had entered the barge, the<br>numerous flags with which the yachts were decked were soon taken down, and pre-<br>parations for sailing became manifest, when the royal squadron was saluted by a dis-<br>charge of artillery; and again from Bruntisland, the Fort of Leith, the ships in the<br>Roads, the Calton-hill and the Castle, as the Royal yacht came opposite to those<br>places, and the squadron was soon out of sight.<p>The King spoke, much of Scotland, and expressed his admiration of Edinburgh<br>beyond any other European City; the conduct of the people was his constant theme.<br>The King expressed his pleasure to sit for his portrait in the Highland dress to Sir<br> Henry Raeburn.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;John Muir, Printer, Glasgow.</p>
