	<h2>Transcription</h2>
	<p> LETTER<p>Directed to Magdalene Munro, North<br>Berwick, from Robert Emond, pre-<br>sent prisoner in the Calton Jail, on<br>suspicion of the Murder of Mrs Franks<br>and her Daughter.<p>Calton Jail, November 18, 1829<p>MY dear Wife, I am now contined in the Cal-<br>ton Jail charged with the murder of your<br>.sister and daughter, which I declare to you I am<br>perfectly innocent, though I have done as much as<br>deservas the gallows. My dear Magdalene, I am<br>sorry and even wish to take my own life when I<br>think upon what I have done te you. I can't get<br>rest .night nor day. I confess that I am a great sinner,<br>and nothing hurts me more than to think that I<br>am under suspicion of the crime of murder. I<br>assure you that I am perfectly innocent of the<br>crime laid to my charge, and I hope God Almighty<br>who sees into all things will be my advocate on<br>the day of trial I am aware the people are invo-<br>terate against me, because the proof (in their opi-<br>nion) is so much against me. I again, my dea-r<br>est Magdalene, declare, I am innocent, although<br>at this time my mind is so  much affected that I<br>hardly know what I say. I have been examined<br>before the Sheriff of Edinburgh saveral times, but<br>I think they can't prove nothing against me. The<br>public are aware I understand of  the iron heels of<br>my shoes corresponding with some marks in Mrs<br>Franks house, and with a bloody shirt found in my<br>house, which you can prove was occassioned by<br>the blooding of my nose, or you know better by<br>the blood that flowed from your head the Sunday<br>preceding that most horrid murder. I understand<br>that the authorities in Edinburgh are anxious to<p>discover my old  coat,--------but I hope in God<p>they never shall. My dearest wife, my name has<br>been branded in Edinburgh by illiterate stationers,<br>and I suppose that even my name in North Ber-<br>wick is held in as much dread as the notorious<br>murderers Burke and Hare. I must allow suspi-<br>cions are against me, but that is nothing, I again<br>implore you to banish from your mind the idea<p>of being the murderer of your sister and niece.....<p>My love to all your friends for friends I have none.<br>Would that God would take me to himself,..<br>ROBERT  EMOND.<p>We have before alluded to the prints in the<br>bloody floor in Mrs Franks' house, corresponding<br>with a pair of shoes be longing to Emond; these<br>shoes are not likely to be unatched in Scotland ;<br>they were manufactured in Sunderland. We are<br>also informed, that Emond, when he  left his own<br>house on the Sunday night, wore two coats. He<br>acknowledges that he put  an  old intending to<br>sleep in his pig-stye, it was to keep the  other clean.<br>This coat he alleges was so much soiled by his<br>falling in ditches, that he tore it in pieces, and<br>threw it away. When seen at Dreme he wore an<br>old coat. More suspicious circumstances against<br>Emond have transpired,?a shirt with blood on<br>the wrist was found in his house at North Ber-<br>wick; and in addition to this, another shirt was<br>found, the front of which is stained with blood,<br>as if a quantity had spouted against it, and been<br>partially washed out. There is also a print upon<br>the breast, as it a bloody hand had taken hold of<br>it. When Emond was shown this, he exclaimed,<br>' Oh! God, be merciful to me !' Captain Brown,<br>that active messenger, has likewise made import-<br>ant discoveries, tending to connect Emond still<br>more closely with the atrocious murders for which<br>he stands committed.</p>
