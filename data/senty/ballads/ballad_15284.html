	<p> SPEECH-CRYING.-One of the most intolerable nuisances<br>which the citizens of Edinburgh are made to endure, is the in-<br>cessant bawling of speech-criers who infest the streets, and <br>swindle the lower orders out of their pence, by vending the<br>most abominable fabrications of robberies and murders. The<br>whole of yesterday, scores of these sturdy vagabonds were busi-<br>ly employed in hawking "an account of a horrid and barbarous <br>murder, between Glasgow and Lanark," which happened some<br>20 or 30 years ago, making it appear as if it had been perpetra-<br>ten within the last few days. Has the police no control over<br>such miscreants ? Is the publisher not amenable to justice ?<p><p><p>THE  LAST  SPEECH,<p><p><p><br>Confession and dying words of the Lives of John Smith, and George<br>Stevenson, who were Executed, at the West End of the Tolbooth<br>of Edinburgh, this day the 21th of January, 1807. For the<br>Crime of Horse Stealing.<p>I JOHN SMITH, aged 50 years, was born of Respectable and<br>honest parents, in England, who gave me an education suitable to<br>their station, and the mode of my country. My youth was rather<br>sober than otherwise. At an early period of life, I took the sacrament<br>in the English manner, with the erroneous idea that it would take away all sin, therefore, I then plunged into all manner of vice. The<br>sabbath was then profaned, and every crime almost within my reach<br>committed. In this manner my life was spent, until I was led to com-<br>mit the crime for which I now suffer. I bless God that I now see my<br>sins in all their horrid guilt, and place all my hope in the blood of<br>Christ. I am not afraid of death, but concerned for my soul. I re-<br>turn my thanks to those ministers and Christians, from whose instruc-<br>tions and prayers I have received such benefit. I commend my wife<br>and family to the mercy and keeping of the Father of the fatherless ;<br>and entreat her to bring them up in the fear of the Lord, that so we<br>may all meet in heaven. Amen.<p>I GEORGE STEVENSON aged 30 years, was born in Eng-<br>land and received an education rather limited. No great regard was<br>paid to instil into my mind the principles of morality and honesty, and<br>thus having no strong principle within I easily fell a prey to seduction<br>without. I admit the justice of the sentence for which I suffer. I<br>am now ready to bless God, who has given me a sight of my sins, and<br>who I trust has pardoned and redeemed me through the blood and me-<br>rits of the Lord Jesus. I heartily join with my fellow sufferer in my<br>thanks, to those Ministers and Christians who have attended us, and<br>with HIM in the most humble posture and with the most contrite heart<br>entreat for pardon of God for Christ sake Amen.<p>N.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; B.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Public, will soon be in Possession of their Dying&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;say-<br>ings, from the most Authentic' source,</p>
