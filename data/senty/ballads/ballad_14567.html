Robbery,<br>and Murder of Margaret Paterson, in a way<br>so cruel, barbarous, and inhuman, as makes<br>the heart of the most obdurate melt with pi-<br>ty, and the very blood freeze with horror.<br>Together with the Indictment against the<br>Prisoners, the names and evidence of<br>the principal witnesses, and an inventory<br>of the articles produced on the Trial. con-<br>sisiting amongst other things, of the un<br>heard of and murderous implements by<br>which poor Margaret Paterson's destruction,<br>was. accomplished.

The indictment then went on to vary the<br>charge in the usual way, by charging an assault with<br>inteut to Ravish.]?LIKEAS, you the Said John<br>Thomsan  and  David Dobie did, both and each, or one<br>or other of you, time aforesaid, at or dear the part of<br>the  road, &c, &c. wickedly and feloniously attack and<br>assault the said deceased Margaret Paterson, and did<br>strike her several severe blows with your fists, and kick<br>her on the head and sides, and other parts of her body,<br>whereby she was, rendered insensible, and did?[Here<br>again the words of the indictment are unfit for-public-<br>cation. They describe particularly the soul harrowing<br>atrogities of the monsters, in forcing into the body of<br>Their already brutally maltreated and insensible victim,<br>three rough cornered pieces of stone  a number of<br>pieces of small coall a quantity of coal dust!  a quantity<br> of hay! and the bone of the corsets of the de-<br>ceased!!! or some other instrument, to the Prosecutor<br>unknown! And having mentioned the dreadful laceva<br>tions-and wounds thus produced, the Indictment went <br>on]  ,----Of the injurious so inflicted, or of one or  other of <br>them, the said  deceased Margaret Paterson languishe if<br>till her death, which took place in the house in Amos<br>close aforesaid, then and now or lately occupied by the<br>said William Paterson, her father, on the 22d day of&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  <br>April, 1830; and the said deceased Margaret Paterson<br>was thus cruely murdered by you the said John Thom -&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  <br>son and David Dobie, or  by one or other of you :<br>LIKEAS, you the said John Thomson and Divid<br>Dobie did, both and each, or one or other of you, time<br>aforesaid, &c. &c. wickedly and feloniously rob the said<br>deceased Margaret Paterson, and did take from her by<br>force and violence, a gold ear ring, a small tin box, two<br>pawn tickets for gowns, one pledged for 3 . 6d , and the<br>other for 4s. the more particular description of the said<br>pawn tickets being to the prosecutor unknown, three<br>shillings and sixpence or thereby in silver money, a key,<br>a checked cotton or muslin handkerchief, a green shawl,<br>a coarse towel, some pieces of card or pasteboard and<br>some pieces of bread and meat, being all the property<br>or in the lawful possession of the said deceased  Mar-<br>garet Paterson:--<p><p>Inventory of Articles Produced in Court,<p>A green shawl, a woman's bonnet, a small<br>Sin box,, a gold ear-ring,  a  key, a handkerchief,<br>a coarse towel, three angular pieces, of, stone,<br>a small quantity of hay, a corset stick, a pair<br>of scissors, a woman's pocket.<p>When the prisoners were brought out of<br>jail to be conveyed over to the Lock up house,<br>Dobie recognized a person whom she  had<br> known, and  said to him. 'This is an awfu'<br>condition for me to be brocht till.'?' It is,<br>Dobie.' was the reply, ? to which he rejoined,<br>'Weel:?I'm as innocent as the child that's<br>unborn.' Thomson said nothing. Both the<br>men were rather meanly, but decently and<br>cleanly dressed ; and had the usual appear-<br>ance of carters in their Sunday clothes that<br>had already been well worn. Both are of slen-<br>der but athletic make ?Thomson about 5 ft.<br>10 in. high.<p>The declarations emitted by the prisonars<br>were of great length, and chiefly consisted of<br>rambling, inconsistent, and unimportant state-<br>ments.<p>Colin Pentland and his wife were called to<br>prove the accidental meeting of the deceased<br> and the prisoners at their house on the night<br>of the 17th of April, and their subsequent de-<br>parture together, with the carts for Gilmerton.<p>Walter Dingwall, residing at Gilmerton, was<br>called to prove that Thomson's horse had<br>brought his cart into the village of Gilmerton<br>without his master. This witness, and the<br>wife of one Bamberry, a slater in Gilmerton,<br>and others, found the shawl of the deceased,<br>her bundle of bread, &c. in Thomson's cart.<p>Alexander Denham and a young man named<br>Wright, and others, in consequence of Thom-<br>son being missing, set off  on the road to Edin-<br>burgh in search of him, On their return, they<br>were attracted by the groans of the deceased<br>to the spot where she was lying, near the<br>third milestone ; and finding her to be in a<br>very deplorable state, they carried her to the<br>house of Bamberry, into which she was hu-<br>manely received. In mean time, a person<br>had met Thomson coming into the village, and<br>had said to him, from the circumstance of the<br>shawl being found in the cart, ' You have had<br>a woman with you to-night.' To which he<br>replied, 'Yes, she's just behind me.<p>Drs Renton and Morrison, of Datkeith,<br>proved the frightful nature of the injuries in-<br>flicted on the deceased, ?her extreme suffer-<br>ings,?her death in consequence of those in-<br>juries,?the appearances of the truly horrid<br>and shocking lacerations and wounds and the<br>consequent mortification, after death,?and<br>also the finding of the stones, &c. within the<br>body of the ill-fated woman,? The same Gen-<br>tlemen also, and other witnesses proved that<br>the deceased had declared, while in the pros-<br>pect of death, that both the prisoners had<br>committed the crimes to which she fell a victim<p>Several witnesses from Greenend and other<br>places proved that the prisoners had made<br>their treatment of the deceased a subject of<br>ribald jest and boasting to their companions.<p>The tin box, belonging to the deceased was<br>traced to the possession of Dobie ; and her<br>handkerchief was taken from Thomson's<br>pocket, when he was apprehended.<p>The Lord justice Clerk, in discharging the<br>Jury, stated that the verdict which they had<br>returned was perfectly consonant with the<br>opinions entertained by the Court. Sentence<br>was then moved, for.<p>Lord Meadowbank ?My Lord justice<br>Clerk?It is little more than eighteen months<br>ago that the melancholy duty devolved on me<br>to propose sentence of death on & pannel con-<br>victed before you of a crime at that time con-<br>sidered almost unparalleled in atrocity. The<br>utmost stretch of our imagination then did not<br>lead us to anticipate the psosibility, that there<br>were living in the midst of civilized society men<br>who could be guilty of still greater atrocities<br>-?of more unparalleled brutality?revolting<br>to every feeling that actuates the mind of man.<br>I am perfectly certain that, were the details<br>of this case unfortunately made public, as,<br>thank God, the power of the law has enabled<br>you to prevent, those details would have ex<br>cited such feelings in this Christian communi-<br>ty as never were before excited. It is hardly<br>possible to imagine that persons would have<br>been found living in this Christian land who<br>could have brought their minds to the com-<br>mission of such atrocious crimes Melancholy<br>it is to think that, had this unprotected female<br>been wandering the world amongst the barbaro<br>barbarous people, she would have been in a<br>state of comparative safety to what she was<br>within three miles of the metropolis of this<br>most civilised country; such is the fact that<p><p>this poor Unhappy woman, after having fallen<br>into the hands of these abandoned men, was<br>treated in a manner which, of necessity, was<br>to produce death?she was robbed of the mis-<br>erable pittance which she had in her posses<br>sion ; and this was committed on a person on<br>whom they had the intention to satisfy other<br>brutal passions, This is the worst feature of<br>the case. I have not words to express the<br>feelings which the details of this day have<br>necessarily excited in my bosom. I have al <br>luded to them generally, and shall only far-<br>ther allude to them by saving, that I think it<br>Was impossible for any human being, who<br>heard the evidence, to entertain a doubt of<br>the perfect propriety of the verdict which has<br>been returned. With these observations, I<br>have now simply to propose to your Lordship<br>to pronounce the sentence of the law, which<br>is that of death, and that it shall be carried<br>into effect on Wednesday the 18th of August<br>next.<p>The Lord Justice Clerk?John Thomson<br>and David  Dobie, you have heard the verdict<br>which has been recorded, and the opinions<br>which their lordships entertain in regard to<br>your case as exhibited in evidence against you ;<br>and following their example,? feeling that  no-<br>word which I can use are capable of describ<br>ing the unparalleled brurality, cruelty, and<br>wickedness, of the foul transaction which has<br>been disclosed this day. I shall not enter into<br>details farther than to remark that the exhi-<br>bition you have made is calculated to make<br>every man blush. Such wickedness and brutal<br>abomination could not have been believed to<br>have been committed, had it not been sworn<br>to in evidence. Following the principle of law,<br>by which the proceedings have been conduct-<br>ed with closed doors till this stage of the pro.<br>ceedings, I shall-refrain from saying any thing<br>f the crimes of which you stand convicted on<br>the clearest evidence ever produced before a<br>jury. But it is my duty to warn you to pre-<br>pare for the inevitable fate which awaits you<br>in this world ; and I warn you, in the most<br>earnest manner, to prepare to appear before<br>the judgment seat of the Almighty, to answer<br>for all the deeds done in the body. Rest as-<br>sured that if ever there was a case in which<br>the law will take it, full course it is yours. <br>You are now to consider That your days on<br>earth, are numbered, and that you have now<br>no other duty in the world but to pray for<br>forgiveness of all your crimes--to humble<br>yourselves at the footstool of your Creator.<br>Do not  lose a single moment in setting about<br>heartfelt repentance?and God grant that it<br>may be sincere,?and  that forgiveness be ex-<br>tended to you for your crimes. His Lordship<br>then sentenced.  the pannels to be executed at<br>Edinburgh, on the 18th August and their<br>bodies given to Dr Monro. professor of ant-<br>tomy for dissection.<p>Dobie addressed the Lord Justice Clerk in<br>in these words, ' My Lord, I have one thing to<br>say, if you please. They cannot dissect the<br>soul."<p>On the way from the Court to&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lock<br>up house, both the prisoners&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;maintained the<br>same appearance as they had done throughout<br>the trial? that is to say,  there was a  restless&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>recklessness in Dobie's movements and in the<br>expression of his countenance while Thomson<br>was&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;collected,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;silent,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;seemingly&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;quite&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>passive in the hands of his conductors.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There<br>was; however,  an occasional quivering of his;,<br>person,an  a solemn thoughtful&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;expression&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>on his pallid countenance,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;which&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;indicated&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>that he felt more than&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;he wished  should be&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>observed by the spectators.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>Until  the&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;evidence&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;had&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;been&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;all&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;gone&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>through; Dobie induced a hope of being ae-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>quitted ; for he had adopted means for secur-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>ing, as he thought,  evidence&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;in  his&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;favour.<p>While be was in the jail, be  wrote a letter to&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>one of,  his cousins, a female  residing in Gl-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>rnerton, instructing her to swear that she had&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>seen Thonson give him the tin box belonging&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>to Margaret  Paterson ; and this would  have&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>accounted&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;for  one of  the strongest circums&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>stances  against&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;him.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  The  letter,  however,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>never reached the hands of the woman.  It was&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>intercepial,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and given&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to the .Sherial,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;who&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>sent for the female.  and  by an&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;interrogatory<br>ascertained  that this was an attempt to suborn&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>a witness and consequently frustrated it.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>wag perhaps for the same reason that several&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <p>persons from Gilmerton, who were in the list<br>of witnessed, were not called to give their<br>evidence for the Crown, as it was probable,<br>from their-intimacy with the prisoners, and<br>other circumstances, that Dobie might have-<br>been tampering with them also.<p>In the Lock-up house, Dobie said that:<br>some of the witnesses had sworn falsely ; but<br>this was chiefly in reference to the amount of<br>silver that the poor murdered woman had in her<br>in her possession.<p>At seven o'clock in the morning, the pri-<br>soners were placed in the usual carriage to<br>be conveyed back to the jail. After they had<br>taken their seats, a tear or two were observed<br>in the eyes of Thomson. Dobie wept plenti-<br>fully, and lamented for his wife and children-<br>(He had sent a sixpence to his wife while the<br>trial was going on, the day before, by one of<br>the witnesses )?Thomson soon assumed his<br>usual appearance of indifference He fre-<br>quently looked at the people through) the car-<br>riage, and remarked that it was ' a fine morn-<br>ing<p>When they got into the condemned cell,<br>Dobie said to Thomson, ' If the woman had been in my cairt,"jock, naething o' this wud<br>hae happened. The woman was a murdered<br>woman,?there's nae doot o' that ! But how<br>thae stans an hay an' things cam about,<br>(he added with an oath) I dinna ken.' Thom<br>son made. no answer to ail this, which must<br>be regarded as a confession by Dobie that he<br>was coocerned in the crimes, though not in<br>the worst.of them ; and Thomson's silence<br>was a still stronger though tacit admission of<br>the full Treasure of his own guilt.?-particularly<br>as neither 0f the prisoners made one single<br>complaint of the justice at their sentence.<br>Dobie spoke often of his wife and children,<br>for whom he lamented the disgrace he had<br>brought on them, and he expressed his hope<br>that his mother and his wife would be admit-<br>ted to see him- Thomson never once opened<br>his mouth., Dobie put an end to the scene.<br>by saying, ''Come, bring us thus elaes (mean-<br>ing the prison dress :) an' let's pit all thir<br>yins.' the behaviour of the men, since, has<br>been firms,.and becoming their situation.<p>The Gilmerton Carters. ? Dobie and Thom-<br>son are now confined in the same cell; and are<br>attended by che Rev. Dr Lee. Since their<br>condemnatory they have been, very quiet. not<br>a word of rejection has proceeded trom one<br>aginst the other. They are both compara-<br>tively illiterate and ignorant. Dobie can read<br>and write, and Thomson is able to read, but<br>it would appear they have derived little or no<br>advantage from these acquirements.<p>The awful nature of his situation, from the<br>first, made a deep impression on Thomson's<br>mind. Since he uas indicted he has been very<p>dull ; and has  become spare In his person.--<p>His coedemnation has had a still greater effect<br>on his spirits, as he appears at times quite ab-<br>stracted and lost in meditation, while at other<br>time; he is restless and uneasy.?Observer.<p>TRIAL OF&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;D. BERTIE.<p>The Indictment, after commencing in the<br>usual term, set forth That alb.it, by the laws<br>of this and every other well governed realm,<br>Rape is a crime of an heinous nature and<br>severely punishable: yet, true it was and of<br>verify that, that David Bertse, the prisoner at the<br>bar. was guilty of the same, he having, on the<br>1 th day of May last, in a house situated in East Cumberland-strtet, then in the occup-<br>tion of Mrs. Jane Skirving, and  in a room in<br>the said house, which he (the prisoner) occu-<br>pied as a lodger, wickedly solicited Margaret<br>Gray, servant to the said Jane Skirving. and<br>on her rejecting his solicitations, did attack<br>her with force and violence in the said room,<br>-?and that on the said Margaret Gray getting<br>away from him, he did some time afterwards<br>in the passage of the said house, again attack<br>he said Margaret Gray, and did seize her by<br>the arm and forcibly drag her back into his<br>room. wherein, in spite of all the resistance in<br>her power, he consummated the crime, with<br>great force and violence?[and the particulars<br>of which, as stated in the indictment, are unit<br>for publication.]<p>The indictment then went on to state, that<br>he pannel, having been apprehended, and<br>taken before the Sheriff substitute, had emit-<br>ed before him. on the 11th and 13th of May<p>two several declaration which being to be<br>used in evidence against him, had been lodged<br>in the usual place for his inspection, as also a<br>medical certificate singed by Dr Thatcher.<br>and another medical certificate  signed by Dr<br>Black surgen to the  Police Establishment,<br>and by Mr A. L. Black and Mr sidey, sur-<br>geons, ?and also one other article, which,<br>though it was named in the indictment and<br>produced on the trial, it would be in proper<br>to mention here.<p>The trial commenced about twelve o'clock ;<br>and the prisoner having  been  placed at the<br>bar. pleaded Not Guilty.<p>The Examination of Margaret Gray (who is<br>not more than fourteen years of age, and who<br>is a doughter o' very decent parents at loppa.<br>where her father is a mason) occupied two<br>hours and a quarter. She underwent a lone<br>and very minute cross examination ; but she<br>was not materially shaken in her principal<br>evidence.<p>There were twenty witnesses in all. for the<br>Crown, amongest whom were, Margaret Gray,<br>Mrs Skirvin., Catherine Johnston.

These temptations having<br>been rejected by the girl, the pannel, as al-<br>leged, next proceeded to use violence in the <br>way libelled is the indictment After the com-<br>mission of the crime, he had left the house.<br>but he returned to it  again, and was in bad<br>when he was apprehended, about eleven,<br>o'clock on the same night, He has all along<br>positively denied the crimes,<p>The prisoner is a young man about twenty<br>eight years of age, dark complexion, roman<br>nose, short stature, and of gentlemanly dress,<br>and appearance. He was Clerk to a Writer<br>in Edinburgh. He came from Brechin.<p>The  exculpatory evidence occupied a very<br>considera be portion of time, and there were<br>several very respectable witness to the cha-<br>racter of the pannel.<p>The Lord Justice Clerk having made a long<br>and able summing up of the evidence, the<br>jury retired to consider of their verdict.<p>During the absence of the jury, the pannel<br>remained in a state of the utmost agitation<br>and anxiety. He repeatedly gazed round<br>him with an indescribably haggard  expression<br>on his countenance, over which hung a cloud<br>of the blackest gloom and most dismal melan-<br>choly. At times he laid his head down on<br>his hands and arms; and for a few moments<br>seemed asleep; and then  he would raise his <br>head again with the same unaltered expres-<br>sion. It struck almost every person in Court,<br>that his apparance now was like that of a<br>maniac, or rather of a drunk man, arousing<br>from Sleep and trying to collect  his dissipared<br>ideas.<p>After an absence of about twenty minutes,<br>the jury returned at eleven o'clock at night<br>and pronounced by, their Chancellor the fol-<br>lowing verdict:- My Lords: Owing to the<br>contrad ctory statement of the evidence, we<br>find the charge Not Proven.'<p>On bearing these joyful words, the prisoner<br>sprung to his feet clapped his hands uttered<br>an exclamation of gratitude to the jury and <br>(all in an instant) appeared as if he wished<br>to seize his hat, and bound at once out of <br>the Court.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  <p>Persons who shook the prisoner by the hand<br>state that it felt like the clammy band of a <br>person newly dead, or dying.<p>Mary Taylor or Leslie, and George Leslie,<br>were accused of stealing a watch.
