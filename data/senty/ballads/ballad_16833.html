	<h2>Transcription</h2>
	<p> A Full and  Particular Account of Robert McKinlay, William<br>Buchanan, Robert Hunter Guthrie, and Alexander Forbes,<br>who were Executed at Glasgow, on Wednesday the 3d No<br>vember, 1819, for housebreaking and theft.<p>This day were executed, pursutant to their sen-<br>tences, Robert M'Kinlay, Wm. Buchanan, Robert<br>Hunter Guthrie, and Alexander Forbes, convicted<br>of housebreaking and  theft.<p>Robert McKinlay and William Buchanan, con-<br>victed, at the last Circuit Court, of breaking into<br>Bothwell Castle, on the 5th May last, the residence<br>of the Right Honourable Lord Douglas, and steal-<br>ing therefrom a gold watch, a silver sneff-box, a<br> silver spoon, a silver candlestick, a silver bread-<br>toaster and several articles of wearing apparel.<br>'There were  several charges against McKinlay at<br>the time of his apprehension, for housebreaking<br>and robbery; one for breaking into a Gentleman's<br>house in Moore Place, breaking into Dr. Speirs'<br>house in Greenock, a shop at Linlithgow, Dal-<br>beth House, a Cotton Mill at Bridgeton, and Both-<br>well Castle. The last act which he committed,<br>and for which he this day surrendered up his life,<br>was perpetrated, in the most daring manner. From<br>the evidence of a Gentleman who slept in the<br>Castle on the night of the robbery, it was supposed<br>that they Lad entered the house by forcing up a<br>window, and actually entered the room where his<br>Lordship was asleep, and carried off the above<br>valuable articles.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the address book at the gate<br>they described themselves, the one as coming from<br>London, the other from Birmingham. The officers<br>of Justice were immediately on the look-out,<br>when Cameron, the Police Officer, apprehended <br>Buchanan on the 10th May; and he soon after,<br>along with Calder, apprehended McKinlay in the<br>Green asleep, when they  found  his Lordship's<br>neckcloth about his neck, and some of the other<br>articles in his possession.<p>M Kinlay was a native of Glasgow, about 24 years<br>of age, by trade a cotton-spinner, but had long<br>given up the sober pursuits of industry, for the<br>more dangerous way of living by preying on the<br>property of the  public.<p>Buchanan was also a native of this city, and was<br>only about 20 years of age; he had never been bred<br>to any regular employment, being of a very unset-<br>tled disposition, and much addicted to pilfering.<br>He had before been twelve months in Bridewell<br>for stealing yarn off a barrow on the streets. His<br>Lordship used his inrluence to get their lives sav-<br>ed, but without effect.<p>Robert Hunter Guthrie  and Alexander Forbes,<br>convicted of breaking into the house of Alexander<br>McLaren, Kilmarnock, on the 12th May last, and<br>stealing therefrom a silver watch, five shirts, two<br>pairs of shoes, a light Marstiles vest, beef ham<br>jelly, cakes, two pieces muslin, 16 spindles yarn<br>&c. In two days after, they were met by Robert<br>Brown (late of the horse patrole) near Barrhead,<br>Renfrewshire, when he immediately gave chace,<br>and  with the assistance of a ploughman, apprehend-<br>ed them, when he found some the stolen articles<br>in their possession. Upon Brown's evidence, and<br>that of several other witnesses  they were found<br>guilty, and on receiving sentence of death, Guthrie<br>immediately said, "My Lord, the sentence is very<br>hard-I had nothing to do with the tundles-I<br>bought the hat and paid for it, as my fellow pri-<br>soner knows." Although the above unhappy<br>criminals were both young men, neither of them<br>being above 22 years of age, yet their names have<br>long been enrolled in the criminal records of their<br>country. Guthrie at the Spring Circuit of 1818,<br>was tried for breaking into a store-room in Paisley,<br>but the libel was found not proven, and he was<br>immediately liberated; at the following Circuit he<br>was again charged with breaking into a soap-work&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>in Paisley and stealing  a considerable quantity of<br>soap, but he was remitted by the Court back to the<br>Sheriff of Renfrewshire, when after trial he was<br>sentenced to be banished the County. He was a<br>native of Paisley, and by trade a wright.<p>Forbes was a native of this city, of honost indus-<br>trious parents, to whom he has been the cause of<br>much pain by his misconduct. He was by trade a<br>calcuderer, but he had long neglected his business,<br>and went about committing depredations on the<br>public. He has often been in the hands of the<br>Police and suffered various imprisonments. In<br>1817 he was con/ill/ed in Paisley Jail on a charge of<br>robbery, but he, along with others found means to<br>break the prison, and escaped. He soon after was<br>observed in the Gallowgate by a person who was<br>on the search for him, who immediately pursued,<br>but he leaped into the burn at the Spoutmouth, and<br>running up a close dealing to the High Street,<br>effected his escape in Wallace Court. He now,<br>along with his unfortunate companion went about<br>the country committing various depredations until<br>unerring Justice  overtook them, and put an end to<br>their crimes with their lives. Considerable exer-<br>tion was made to have their sentence com/ill/ed,<br>but failed.<p>The melancholy scene we have this day witness-<br>ed must have the effect of touching with anguish,<br>the heart of every friend of humanity__every lover<br>of our species; four young men, (a sight never be-<br>fore witnessed in Glasgow) suffering&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ignominiously,<br>shamefully, and ingloriously on the scaffold, for<br>breaking the laws of their country, whom, had the<br>ability they evidently possessed, been directed<br>aright, might have been in honour in themselves,<br>a happiness to their families, and made them useful<br>members of society. The praise-worthy humanity<br>displayed at the last Spring Circuit has not had<br>the benevolent effect intended by the law author-<br>ities, hut it is to be hoped that the just, tho' heart-<br>rending spectacle of this day, will make a lasting<br>impression on the minds of the spectators, and have<br>a proper effect on all these unthinking persons who<br>prey on the property of their neighbours, for they<br>may rest assured, thas however fortunate they may<br>be for a time, the powerful arm  of the law will imm-<br>ediately reach, and punish them according to their<br>deserts.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<p>Printed for John Muir.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  </p>
