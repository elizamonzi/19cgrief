He was at Dalkeith fair on the 12th of May last, where<br>he sold two horses. He sold one of them for 20 guineas to a Mr<br>Hogg, from whom he received two £5 notes, one of these was on<br>Royal Bank, and the other on Sir W. Forbes and Co. He put the<br>along with three he had brought from home, into the pocket of an<br>inside vest, under the band of his small clothes. Archibald Brock-<br>ie was present, and saw him so dispose of his money. He sold the<br>other horse, to R. Bain, for £4, 10s.?putting the bank notes beside<br>those he previously secured, and 30s. of silver in his fob Witness,<br>after selling the horses, went into the Harrow Inn, with Thomas<br>Marr and Robert Scott, and remained there till about two o'lock the<br>following morning. He was induced to stay so late that he might<br>have company home. They had only two gills of whisky, and<br>three bottles of porter?but all were sober. Had all his money<br>when he left Dalkeith, in company of Marr and Scott. When the<br>party reached Lugton toll, it was joined by the pannels, and shortly<br>after by William Mathewson, and William Wilkie. The whole<br>went on together, till they came to Campend, where one of the pan-<br>nels advised witness to go through the fields. to show him .(Sharp)<br>a nearer way to Gilmerton than the high road. The pannels and<br>witness accordingly left the other men, and went across first one<br>field, and over a dyke till they came to a second park, which was<br>progress of being ploughed. Sharp then went behind him, in a <br>laughing manner, and griped him by the face, throwing him down-<br>backwards to the ground. Sharp put his hand upon witness's<br>mouth, and prevented his crying or speaking; at the same time<br>Mitchell tore away his fob and the silver. Mitchell then offered to<br>go away. Sharp however said, " that was not all yet," and direc-<br>ted him (Mitchell) to go to the other side. Mitchell immediately<br>went to the other side and pulled out the book?took the money out<br>of it, and then threw it down. The pannels were upon witness for<br>three or four minutes, and when they left him they went towards<br>Gilmerton, while he endeavoured to regain the friends he had left<br>on the Dalkeith road. He overtook Mathewson and Scott, Marr<br>and Wilkie had gone on. a little way before. He then told what<br>had happened him. When he got the length of Edmonstone gate,<br>he met a man named Thomson, and being rather confused, the lat-<br>ter agreed to see him to his mother's house. Witness sew Sharp<br>in the market, he knew him well, for they had been brought up in<br>the same town, and were school fellows. Sometime after the rob-<br>bery, he returned to the field, and pointed out the spot where the<br>violence was committed on him.<p>Preceding evidence was corroborated by several other witnesses.<p>The Lord Justice Clerk summed up the evidence at considerable<br>length, remarking that there never was an act of violence to the<br>extent mentioned, more clearly established; but it was for the Jury<br>to say whether it had been fully corroborated, and whether what<br>had been brought forward in exculpation tended to weaken that<br>evidence.<p>The jury, after a few minutes absence, returned a viva voce ver-<br>dict, finding the pannels guilty, but unanimously and earnestly<br>recommended them to mercy.<p>Lord Gillies, after a few observations on the nature of the crime<br>of which the paanels had been convicted, proposed that they should<br>be executed at Edinburgh, on the 17th day of August next. Lord<br>Mackinzie concurred; and the Lord Justice Clerk then feelingly<br>and, impressively addressed the pannels, before pronouncing the<br>awful sentence, which doomed them to piate their crimes on a scaf-<br>fold on the 17th of August<p><br>Edinburgh: Printed for Alexander Turnbull....Price One Penny.  </p>
