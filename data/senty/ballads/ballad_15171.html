	<p> A Full, and Particular, Account of the Execution of John<br>Wilson, and Duncan Fraser, who were Executed, at the<br>Head of Libberton Wynd, on Wednesday morning the<br>28th. January, 1824, for Housebreaking and Theft, with<br>a, Particular Account, of their Behaviour since their con-<br> demnation, and&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;at the Place of Execution.<p>THESE Unfortunate Young Men, JOHN WILSON, and DUNCAN FRA-<br>SER, were tried at Edinburgh, before the High Court of Justiciary, and<br>a respectable Jury, on Monday the 22d of December last, for Housebreaking and<br>Theft, aggravated by being habit and repute common Thieves. They were<br>charged with breaking into the Shop of Mr James Smyth, tailor and broker in<br>St Mary's Wynd, Edinburgh, on the 8th of October last, and stealing therefrom<br>a great many articles of Wearing Apparel. To which charge they both pled<br>Guilty, though repeatedly cautioned by the Lord Advocate, as to the perilous<br>situation in which they stood, and the serious nature of the charge, upon which<br>a capital sentence must inevitably follow, it not being his intention to restrict<br>the libel to an arbitary punishment. They adhered to thier confession of<br>Guilt, however, which was recorded, and they were duly convicted in terms thereof,<p>The Lord Justice Clerk, in pronouncing judgment, said it was distressing to<br>observe, that the offence of housebreaking and theft should be persevered in by<br>persons arrived at the prisoners' age of maturity and discretion, notwithstand-<br>ing the examples which had been very recently made, in this very city, of indit<br>viduals who had forfeited their lives to the violated laws of their country. I<br>was still more distressing to observe, that the prisoners belonged to a class of<br>offenders who laboured under the repute of being habitual thieves, and of hav-<br>ing been previously convicted of theft. Would to God that they had taken<br>warning from the example of the first conviction, and that the Court had been<br>spared the pain of inflicting....that the prisoners had been thus happily rescued<br>from the dreadful necessity of suffering.... and that their distressed relatives had<br>been spared the affliction of, witnessing?the disgraceful punishment of their<br>guilt. His Lordship, under a very evident oppression of feeling, proceeded to<br>to state that he had that morning seen a letter from the father of the prisoner,<br>Wilson, which, appeared to have been written under all the agony of mind which<br>a parent might be expected to feel on contemplating the present disgraceful si-<br>tuation of his son. (This unfortunate lad's parent, we understand, is now in a<br>mad house of this City, having lost his reason on hearing the condemnation of<br>his Son). His Lordship, after recommending the prisoners to apply, without<br>loss of time, to spiritual counsel and assistance, then read the sentence of the<br>Court, ordaining the prisoners to be executed on Wednesday, the 28th of Janu-<br>ary next, between the hours of eight and ten morning.<p>Accordingly, they were early  on Tuesday removed to the Lock-up-House,<br>where they were waited on by several of their nearest relations, and the separa-<br>tion from some of them was most appaling to the most hardened feelings. The<br>Clergy of the city, as well as the Chaplain of the Jail, and other good Christians<br>in town; were most attentive and most earnest for their religious instruction<br>and edification, which they repeatedly and sincerely acknowledged.<p>They slept little or none on Tuesday evening, and the Clergyman and offi-<br>ciating Magistrates waited on them in the Hall of the Lock-up-House, a little<br>before Eight o'clock on Wednesday morning, when they joined most fervently<br>in the devotional supplications put up on that occasion. After which, their arms<br>were pinioned, and the melancholy procession moved up, in a slow and solemn .<br>manner, to the head of Libberton Wynd, attended by a strong detachment of<br>Police Officers. They appeared on the scaffold, decently dressed, about half-<br>past eight o'clock, where a psalm was sung, in which they joined; and a most<br>impressive prayer put up for them to the throne of mercy, by one of the Cler-<br>gymen present; during which they appeared most devout and attentive to what<br>was so eloquently urged in thir behalf. Having taken a solemn farewell of '<br>those around them, they mounted the fatal drop, with a little assistance, where<br>they appeared most fervent in prayer, while the ropes were adjusting round<br>the beam. All things being prepared, and having taking farewell of each other,<br>they dropt the signal, and were launched into eternity about 9 o'clock.<p>Edinburgh, Printed for James Dogherty, Price One Penny,</p>
