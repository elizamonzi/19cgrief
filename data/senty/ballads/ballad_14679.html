	<p> Trial & Sentence.<p>An account of the Trial and Sentence of WATSON, the Ra-<br>dical, who fled from this country in the year 1820, and was to<br>be Hanged in America on the 8th of February last, for the<br>crimes of Housebreaking and Theft, with an account of his<br>life since he landed in that country.<p>Extract of a letter received in Glasgow from Baltimore, dated Feb. 23d, 1822.<p>" You may remember my telling you I had seen the famous Watson, the Spafield<br>leader of the London Radicals, at Nashville, Tennessee. The subsequent history of<br>this unfortunate young man shall fill my sheet, as I have no private business worth<br>communicating. In the fall of 1820, Watson married Miss Mary Poyzer, a most ami-<br>able girl, eldest daughter of an English gentleman of that name, who aided Watson<br>in his escape, paid his passage, and accompanied him to the United States, whether<br>he was then going to take possession of a large property left him by a brother at Nash-<br>ville.<p>Watson accompanied the family of Poyzer to Nashville, and got a situation in a<br>druggist's store,?Mr Poyzer discovering in Watson a partiality for his daughter, and<br>this not being agreeable to him, had discharged him from his house at the time I was<br>in that country ; but the affections of the daughter had been engaged, and she eloped<br>with Watson and was married to him. The father would not permit either of them<br>to enter the house. The seeds of dissipation were too deep-rooted in Watson to per-<br>mit him to remain steady ; he became a habitual drunkard, and ill-treated his wife,<br>and turned her out of doors. The father moved with compassion at the helpless<br>situation of his daughter, took her home again. In order to procure the means of<br>dissipation, Watson had recourse to breaking a store, and in December last stood his<br>trial at the criminal court at Nashville.<p>He was indicted on two charges?1st, Store-breaking and Robbing,__2d, Robbing<br>the Rev. Mr Hume's dwelling of sundry articles of clothing, &c. When the Judge<br>enquired, if he had any thing to say why sentence should not be passed upon him, Wat-<br>son rose, and made such a powerful appeal to the feelings, as filled the whole Court<br>with tears; even the lawyers wept aloud Separate sentences were pronounced upon<br>each offence. For the first offence, to be hanged by the neck, till he be dead, dead,<br>on the 8th of February (this present month). For the second to be branded and<br>cropt. [This reminds of us men who are first hanged and then beheaded, and ap-<br>pears in our own country as ridiculous as the sentence of the American Judge when<br>he orders a man to be burnt in the arm and cropt when dead ; it shows something<br>savage, for it cannot be called a punishment to exercise cruelty upon a breathless<br>corpse].<p>Mr ?? who was present on the trial, tells me application has since been made<br>to the Governor for a reprieve, but it was not granted. The Nashville papers subse-<br>quent to the 8th have not. yet arrived here. No doubt they will contain an account<br>of the Execution.<p>It will be recollected that a strict search was made for Watson on board the vessel<br>which conveyed him from this country, but having dressed himself,in the habit of a<br>Quaker, he evaded their scrutiny. Upon being asked what place he belonged to, he<br>answered, " What, is that to thee, go about thy business, and do not trouble me with<br>thy inquisitive questions." He then walked away, and left Watson in perfect peace<br>when he saw him quit the ship.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;W.
