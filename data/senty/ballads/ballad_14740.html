	<p> A  SHORT ACCOUNT&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <p>OF THE<p>MARTYRDOM  OF JAMES ALGIE & JOHN PARK,<p>WHO SUFFERED AT THE CROSS OF PAISLEY, ON THE 3RD OF FEBRUARY, 1685.<p>(From the Liberator.)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  <p>THE Broomlands church has changed its name.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A stone&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>has been inserted over the main door, bearing the'follow-<br>ing inscription:-<p>MARTYRS' CHURCH,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  <p>Erected in 1835, by the Friends of the&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  <p>Church of Scotland.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <p>"Blessed are they that dwell in thy house, they will&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>be still praising thee."<p>This name is given, ostensibly, as a tribute to the me- <br>mory of the martyrs who are buried in the adjoining field, <br>which field is to be included in the new burying ground, <br>and an clegant mounment is to be created over the precious <br>remains, from a design by Mr. Drummond, architect,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <p>The martyrs, James Algie and John Park, were exe-<br>cuted at the Cross of Paisley, on Tuesday, Feb. 3, l635,<br>for refusing the abjuration and test oaths, and were buried<br>in the Gallowgreen, near to the foot of what is now Max- <br>welton Street. About 50 years ago, what remained of <br>their bones and dust were removed, and interred in the field <br>above alluded to, which at that time was intended for a <br>public cemetry.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  <p>Those patriots who have served their country, who have <br>died in its defence, or who have laid down their lives for <br>the cause of truth, ought to be held in ever-honoured re- <br>membrance. Their heroic deeds, their noble daring, and <br>their godly virtues, are associated with the best and the <br>purest feelings of the human heart; and he whose heart <br>dose not warm, and his puls best his at the recollection <br>of the stern honour, the indomitable spirit of independ-  <br>ence, and matchless perseverance of the persecuted Cove-  <br>nanters, during trials and perils almost unexampled in the&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>annals of civilized life, is neither a true Scotsman, nor the&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>friend of the human kind.<p>Some there are , who consider that the giving of the&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  <br>church the name of " Martyrs'," arises from selfish mo-  <br>tives, with a view that it will operate as an enthusiastic  <br>charm, thereby securing to the house more general patron- <br>age and secular attention ; but in a case like this, the pa-  <br>triot and the philosopher cares little for the motives, if<br>they are founded in honour.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ere long, the men and the <br>motives, and the present generation will be gone and for-  <br>gotten, but the church and its inscription will remain to<br>point out to the patriot pilgrim the path to the martyrs'<br>tomb.<p>The present church of Scotland, however, must retrace<br>its steps, and a long course of defection, before it can bear<br>any resemblance to that Church of Scotland for which<br>these martyrs suffered. The present Scottish Church is<br>essentially Erastian in its constitution, very unlike the pure<br>republican form of the ancient church. In its ancient<br>practice the church conducted its election on the princi<br>ple of universal suffrage; the minister and the members of<br>session were appointed by the people. Accordingly, its<br>presbyteries, its synods, and the General Assembly, spoke<br>the voice of the people, and in truth shewed the very form<br>and pressure of the times. Hence their judicatories were<br>the determined advocates of the rights of the people, both<br>civil and religious, and hence the hatred in which they<br>Were held by the aristocracy and by a profligate court. It<br>was the sage apothegm of Charles II. that a Presbyterian<br>Church was incompatible with a kingly government, and<br>these views led to that severe and ruthless persecution of<br>which the martyrs in question, among many thousands of<br>others, were the victims. There is one curiosity in this<br>state of thlings which is noticed neither by Voluntaries nor<br>Compulsories, viz. a Church firmly established, and yet, so<br>far from being influenced by the State, always acting<br>powerfully in opposition to the arbitrary sway of a corrupt <br>government. <p>As an elucidation of what we have wrote, and to give<br>information on a subject that is but partially known, we<br>deem it proper to give a brief narrative of the" transactions<br>connected with the apprehension and legal murder of the<br>two young martyrs, and we hope that the inference drawn<br>from the whole will shew the absolute necessity for every<br>individual, whatever his rank in life may be, to be con-<br>stantly on the watch, least his civil and religious rights<br>should be invaded.<p>James Algie and John Park were residents in the pa-<br>rish of Eastwood, and had, for some time previous to their<br>arrestment, rented conjunctly the small farm of Kennes-<br>head,1n the barony of Darnley. They had,however, left<br>it some short time antecedent to this, which so irritated<p>the person that had been instrumental in bringing them<br>into the farm, that, in the vindictive spirit of revenge, he<br>sent his nephew, upon Sabbath, Feb. 1st, with a letter to<br>John Cochrane of Ferguslie, at Paisley, baillie of the re-<br>gality of Darnley, informing him that these two persons<br>were inimical to the Government, and that he, as judge <br>ordinary, ought to notice them, as he would be answera<br>ble. The bearer arrived during the forenoon's service, and<br>was put into confinement until it was over, when a party<br>of soldiers were ordered out, and the two young men were<br>seized in their own house while at worship, and imme<br>diately carried to Paisley, where they underwent a long-<br>examination in the afternoon ; but not giving satisfaction,<br>they were, as was to be expected, committed for trial, which<br>was appointed, to take place on Tuesday. On Monday<br>they were visited by a pions Presbyterian minister, one of<br>the indulged, as they were termed." They appeared to him<br>to be pious, consciencious men, and that they had latterly<br>imbibed the doctrines of those who denied the king's auth-<br>ority. He, however, so far overcame their scruples, that<br>they consented to take the oath of abjuration ; but when,<br>in open court, they offered to take the oath, the bloody<br>minded Hamilton of Orbiston answered, "The abjnration <br>oath shall not save you,unless you  take the test also, you <br>shall hang presently." The men, having a just abhorrence<br>of the test, instantly replied, " If to save our lives we must<br>take the test, and the abjuration will not save us, we will<br>take no oaths at all. This was about ten o'clock in the<br>morning, and they were immediately sentenced to be hang-<br>ed at two in the afternoon. Orbiston was the commis-<br>sioner of the court of justiciary, and he was bound by the<br>law, even as it then stood, to liberate them on their taking<br>the oath of abjuration ; but the truth was, Lord Ross was<br>the prime mover in all these bloody transactions, and Or-<br>biston was a mere tool in his hands, and it was determined<br>that these men should die.  Orbiston boasted after the sen-<br>tence was passed,  " They thought to have cheated the<br>judges, but, by G?d, I have tricked them."&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So dreadful<br>was the thirst for innocent blood in these evil days.<p>When they came to the scaffold they behaved with great<br>fortitude, but when they attempted to address the assem-<br>bled multitude, the drums were beat to drown their voice <br>They sang the118th psalm, from the 17th verse down,<br>wards, and when giving out the lines :?<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We shall not die, but live, and shall<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The works of God discover?<p>the miscreant Lord Ross exclaimed, shaking his head,<br>" But ye shall dic."<br>The able and acute editor of Wodrow's history, Dr.<br>Burns, attempts to extenuate this internal saying of Lord<br>Ross, (merely, we suppose, because it was the saving of a<br>Lord), on the grounds that that nobleman  alluded to the<br>chance of a rescuc. But on reading Wodrow's account of<br>the execution, the very reverse of a rescue is quite ap-<br>parent and no man can have the least hesitation in  saying<br>that the exclamation proceeded from the black  malignant<br>heart of the wretch.<p>After singing the psalm and praying, they offered their<br>bible to any of the crowd that  might be pleased to accept<br>them,  but such  was, the general fear that no person would<br>take them.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The martyrs then quietly declared that they,<br>would die with the word of truth in their bosoms.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Their<br>waiscoats were accordingly unbuttoned by the executioner,<br>and the bibles placed nearest their heart,and in a feiv mo-<br>ments these worthy youths  were launched  into eternity.<p>Thus died these noble martyrs ;  and well may their sim-<br>ple epitaph say<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" This shall a standing  witness be,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Twixt Presbytery  and Prelacy."<p>The miscreant Lord Ross outlived the Revolution, and<br>received emolument, and was covered with undeserved<br>honour by the WHIGS; but nothing could allay the horrors<br>of his perturbed imagination, which peopled his den at<br>Hawkhead with demons, and other evil spirits,<br>tan himself was said frequently to pay him a visit; and<br>often had the pious ministers of the Abbey church to wait<br>upon him for the purpose of soothing his awakened con-<br>science. He at length went to his account; the name is<br>now totally extinct, and the family is merged in that of'<br>Kelburne. And happy for the world, if any of that gall<br>and malignity of spirit which characterized Lord Ross be<br>inherited by his successors, it must quietly evaporate in<br>the petty persecution of poachers.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<p>CALDWELL AND  SON PRINTERS.</p>
