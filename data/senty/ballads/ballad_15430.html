	<p> NEW INTENDED<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Act of Parliament,<p>To be passed into a Law, on the first meeting of the Reformed<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Members in the House of Commons.<p>Good people all, I pray attend<br>To these few lines that I have penned,<br>We thought that times would surely mend,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the Reform Election.<br>But cheating it is now a trade,<br>By it some carry a losty head,<br>And the poor honest man can't earn his bread-<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Tis time for a Reformation.<p>At a meeting of the lovers of fair play and justice, held in this town, the fol-<br>lowing resolutions were adopted:?<p>1st, That this meeting has observed, with indignation, the manner that many<br>of our fellow men are treated by their hard-hearted wives, viz. in being starved,<br>abused, flogged, cuckolded, &c. ; degrading men lower than the brute reation.<br>We, therefore, enjoin and command all henpecked husbands to unite against<br>their general enemy, by forming henpecked societies, who shall, at all times, be<br>ready to assist each other. Those societies to remain as long as occasion shall<br>require, unless the women submit, or hazard their ancient power, by coming to<br>a general engagement with their husbands.<p>2d. That all bakers mixing bean-meal, bone-dust, potatoes, or any other spuri-<br>eous composition, among their bread, or detected giving light weight, they shall<br>be put into the oven immediately after the batch is drawn.<p>3d, That all grocers, selling sloe leaves among their tea, ground beans in their<br>coffee, or sand in their sugar, shall suffer the pain of pillory in a treacle cask for<br>one hour, and then set down beside a hive of bees, that they may have the bene-<br>fit of the treacle.<p>4th, That all butchers who stick lumps of fat meat beneath their scales to cast<br>the weight, shall be fed on bullocks' blood and saw-dust one callander month.<p>5th, That all publicans, selling swipes for strong ale, mixing vitriol in their<br>whisky, or making two chalk marks for one, to the annoyance of their customers<br>health and purses, they shall be made to go to church for three Sundays, and<br>stand upon one leg, in a white sheet, for all the boys to spit and hoot at.<p>6th, That any shoemaker, making a pair of shoes with rotten leather, shall be<br>fed on horses manes, and his nose to be stuck to the lapstone with wax for the<br>space of five hours every day during the period of their natural lives<p>7th, All other trades that cheat the public, such as blacksmiths, white smiths,<br>mill-wrights, nailers, tailors, sailors, sawers, lawyers,joiners, coiners, barbers,<br>barbers clerks, masons, bricklayers, clerks, painters, spirit-drinkers and quack<br>doctors, &c., shall suffer the pains and penalties according to the nature of their<br>several offences:?<p>Wee'll rub all Tyrants with a rod,<br>And send all rogues and cheats to quad,<br>For the hangman then will get a job,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the Reformation.<br>Since roguery is all the jest,<br>I'rn sure the doctor is the best,<br>For if you die, of friends berest,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He claims you for dissection.<p>8th, Be it further enacted, that no young woman shall wear more than thirty-<br>six curls in her hair, or more than twelve flounces in the tail of her gown, or a<br>leghorn bonnet more than two yards wide, under the pain of being confined in<br>a garret for six weeks to nurse cats, that she may be well practised in the art of<br>nursing, before marriage.<p>9th, That any married woman, who goes about gossiping, instead of minding<br>her husband's business, he shall be authorised to chain her to the bed-post?<br>feed her on water-gruel - likewise to deprive her of the comforts of matrimony<br>for the long space of eight nights.<p>10th, That any man who drinks more than one quart of rum, or whisky at a<br>time, or eight quarts of ale, his wife shall be authorised to chain him to the<br>handle of the frying-pan till sober.<p>If a man gets drunk and beats his wife,<br>By that means he'll raise up strife,<br>He's sure to lead the Devil's life<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By the rules of Reformation.<br>They say that women should not wear<br>Dandy caps and curly hair,<br>As that they do now every where,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the Reformation.<p>llth, Be it further enacted, that any old man, marrying a young virgin, and<br>not be able to accomplish all the necessary duties of the married state, his wife<br>shall be duly authorized to employ a journeyman ; and on his disapproval of<br>the same, he shall be dipped in a tub of cold water every day, till his wife fall<br>in the family way.<p>But now I am nearly done,<br>I hope I have offended none;<br>But live in hopes the times may mend,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the Reformation.<p>EDINBURGH :?Printed by Menzies, Lawnmarket.</p>
