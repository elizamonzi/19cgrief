Mr.<br>M'Call one of the ministers of this city, the<br>Sheriffs of the three counties of Lanark, Ren-<br>frew&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and Dumbarton were called upon and ap-<br>peared, Then the Lord Advocate  for Scotland<br>his commission was read appointing Mr William<br>Craig advocate, to be his advocate depute for the<br>western circuit, and the oaths of allegence and<br>abjuration having been  tendered to him he ac-<br>cordingly took the same; and  thereafter David<br>Aitken, alias Anderson,  present prisoner in the<br>tolbooth of Glasgow was called to the bar, when<br>the advocate depute, on account of some certain<br>circumstances deserted  the diet against the prison-<br>er pro loco et tempore, and thereafter presented a<br>petition to the Judges craving a new warrant of<br>commitment against him to be incarcerate in the<br>tolbooth&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of Glasgow, which&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;they accordingly<br>granted, and in consequence thereof he was im-<br>mediately carried back to prison.<p>John Cox present prisoner in  the tolbooth of<br>Glasgow was then called to the bar, the libel or<br>indictment being read to him by the clerk of<br>court, he was asked by the Lord Justice Clerk<br>if he was guilty of the crime charged and now<br>read on which he began to  speak but could not<br>be understood on account of some impediment in<br>his speech, when Mr Hogg advocate arose and<br>moved in court that the pannel now standing at<br>the bar was an absolute idiot, and said he had not<br>the least doubt but he could prove the same, upon<br>which he was ordered back to prison until six<br>o 'clock at night; afterwards Kennedy Murray,<br>present prisoner in the tolbooth of Glasgow, chr-<br>ged with breaking into a house in the old wynd,<br>and stealing from thence a box belonging to a<br>trvelling chapman, and habite and repute a thief,<br>was brought to the bar, the Judge asked him how<br>old he was, the pannel answered that he was nine-<br>teen his indictment being read by the clerk of<br>court, Mr Hogg advocate presented a petition<br>signed by the pannel craving to be banished,<br>which the advocate depute consented to, on which<br>he was ordered back to prison, the court then<br>adjurned  till six o'clock at night.<p>Between six and seven the court again met,<br>When John Cox was ordered to the bar, and af-<br>ter several long speeches for the crown and for<br>the pannel the court allowed a proof of his insa-<br>niry or being an idiot, and after a number of wit-<br>nesses were examined several of whom were sur-<br>geons; one in particular being asked if he thought<br>the pannel knew good from evil, answered he did<br>not think it,for when he reproved him for any evil<br>action, and asked him What he thought would<br>become of him? he made answer, that there were<br>no devils here but that they were all in the castle<br>of Stirling. The court then adjourned to ten<br>o'clock next day.<p>Sept. 20. The court being met according to<br>appointment, John Cox was again brought to the<br>bar, when their Lordships having considered the<p>depositions of the witnesses, they found it proven <br>that the pannel was in such a state as rendered<br>him not a proper object trial and insane. They<br>therefore ordained him to be carried back to prison<br>therein to be detained until sufficient caution be<br>found acted in the books of ajdournal, that he<br>shall be kept in some sure place so as not to hurt<br>the public under the penalty of 500 merks.<p> David Barcley weaver in Beith was then<br>brought  to the bar, when the advocate depute<br>for certain reasons deserted the diet against the<br>prisoner, and craved warrant of commitment a-<br>gainst him, when he was ordered back to prison,<br>and from thence to be remitted back to Paisley<br>prison.<p>Elizabeth Paul, alias Wilson was thereafter brought<br>to the bar, indicted for stealing cloth from a bleach-<br>field in the Abby parish of Paisley, and being habite<br>and repute a thief ; the indictment being read to her<br>she was asked if she was guilty? she answered not. <br>Where upon their Lordships found the lybel relevent<br>to infer the pains of law, and after several witnesses<br>were examined, the advocate depute sumed up the<br>evidence on the part of the crown, and Mr Clerk<br>advocate for the pannel, when the Lord Justice<br>Clerk charged the Jury in a very able speech, and<br>the Jury having inclosed, in a short time returned a<br>verdict unanimously finding the lybel proven, their<br>Lordships delayed pronouncing sentence till to-<br>morrow one o'clock.<p>Daniel M'Kay was also called to the bar, and the<br>indictment beeng read to him, he was asked if he<br>was guilty of the crime lybelled, to which he made<br>answer that he was, upon which their Lordships<br>found the lybel relevent to infer the pains of law,<br>and remitted the pannel to the verdict of an assize,<br>and after several witnesses were examined, the Ad-<br>vocate depute summed up the evidence on the part<br>of the crown, and the pannel's Advocate for his<br>part, when their Lordships charged the Jury, after<br>which they were inclosed, and in a short time re-<br>turned a verdict unanimously finding  the lybel pro-<br>ven, when their Lordships delayed passing sentance<br>till the time aforesaid.<p>Sept. 21 st, The court met according to appoint-<br>ment, and Daniel M'Kay being brought to the bar<br>was sentenced to be banished for life, and his service<br>adjudged for seven years, with certification if ever<br>he was found in Great Britain he should suffer death.<br>Next Kennedy Murray was called to the bar, and<br>was sentenced to be banished for fourteen years, and<br>his Service adjudged for seven years, with certifica-<br>tion if ever he was found in Scotland during that<br>period he was to be whipped upon the Wednesday<br>after his being brought to Glasgaw prison. And<br>lastly, Elizabeth Paul, alias Wilson being called to<br>the bar, the verdict of the assize was read to her,<br>and after the Judge had long reasoned on the hain-<br>ousness of her crime, afterwards passed sentence,<br>which was, to be carried back to prison until the 25<br>day of Octr. next and on that day to be taken from<br>thence to the common place of execution, and there<br>to be hanged by the neck betwixt the hours of two<br>& four o'clock afternoon until she was dead.<p>Lord Justice Clerk admonished her to employ the<br>short time that she had  to live in preparing for a<br>future state, & warned the spectators to take warn-<br>ing by the poor unhappy woman now at the bar, e-<br>specially young persons, by showing how hard it was<br>to bring those that had been long addicted to vici-<br>ous habits off from them.</p>
