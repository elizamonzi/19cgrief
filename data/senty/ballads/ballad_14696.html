	<p> A WARNING TO ALL YOUNG LOVERS<p>Bring the Last Dying Speech and Concession of these two un-<br>happy Lovers,JOHN CAMAISH-and CATHRINE KIN-<br>KIN RADE who were Executed in the Isle of Man on Friday-<br>the  18th of April last, for the cruel and inhuman Murder of<br>Mr  Camaish, who was with child at the time.<p>The office of Executioner was performed by one  of the principal Magistrates of the<br>Island, when the unfortunate Female came to the ground, by the rope giving way.<p>Douglas, April 24, 1823 -JOHN CAMAISH, 28, & CATHRINE KINRADE,<br>19, were lately convicted of giving poison to the wife of Camish, when pregnant,<br>whereby the death and that of her unborn infant was occasioned. On Friday, the<br>18th inst, these persons  were executed on the Lake near Castletown; the spot usual-<br>ly appropriated for public executions, where an immense concourse of spectators<br>were  early assembled, for the purpose of witnessing the last moments of the prison-<br>ers. The surrounding eminences were covered with young and old of both sexes.<p>It is a melancholy fact, that the female Kinrade, at the time of her committal to<br>prison, was actually unable to prayl?but the indefatigable and praise worthy instruc-<br>tions of the pious individuals who attended her, soon enabled her to bow her knee,<br>and implore the mercy of an offended Maker, and so earnest and heartfelt was she in<br>her prayers, as to excite the pity of all who heard her: she prayed hourly in the<br>Manks language, with a fervency and feeling that evidently shewed her deep contri-<br>tion and remorse. She was a young woman of uncommonly interesting and rather<br>hands me features and appearance, considering her rank and station in life, She<br>confessed that she had been the cause (actuated by the base suggestions and insidi-<br>ous arts-of Camish) of the death of' her own sister. He first beguiled this unfortu-<br>nate sharer of his ignominious death, at a period when -he was little more than 13<br>years of age, although subsequently held criminal intercourse with her sister.<p>Camish, until within the last four or five days evinced little or no remorse or con-<br>trition, but latterly he was agitated in the extreme; and his limbs and who body<br>were in a continual tremor; refusing all food. On the morning of the execution he<br>confessed that he purchased the poison first administered to his wife by Kinrade in<br>then porridge, which caused her to vomit very much, attended with violent pains in<br>the  head and bowels. Finding this draught not deadly enough, he went to anothea<br>shop in Ramsoy, and bought some more arsenic, under the pretence of destroying<br>vermin, which he gave to his wife, under, the diabolical pretext that " he had got<br>something; to cure,"?after taking this second draught she almost instantly expired!<p>On the morning of the execution the female prisoner requested an interview with<br>Camaish which was complied with. A brief interchange of words took place, in<br>which she gently reproached him for his guilty life, but hoped they should die in,<br>forgiveness towards each other; they-forgave each other, shook hands, and parted.<p>Previous to the removal of the prisoners from the gaol, the executioner placed the<br>ropes round their necks. The doleful tolling of the chapel bell announced the com-<br>mencement of the procession from the Castle to the place of death. In the the cart<br>which conveyed the victims of unlicensed intercourse, sat several ministesr acmon-<br>ishing and exhorting the prisoners as to their futuer hopes On arriving, at the gal-<br>lows, the cart was drawn underneath, when the Rev Mr. Kewley put up a short<br>prayer  for the prisoners, and pathetically embracing the female Kinrade, and shak-<br>ing hands with Camaish, descended from the cart, when the executioner (by law the<br>Coroner of Ayre Sheading) proceeded in his painful task; the cart was drawn away,<br>and they were huried into eternity amid the tears and groans and shrieks of the sur-<br>rounding  multitude, which were not a little increased from the circumstance  he<br>rope which Cathrine Kinrade was suspended giving way, her feet touching high the<br>ground evenil times. Camaish struggled very little; the vital spark was soon extinct.<br>The dissolution of the girl was lengthened by the rope slipping, but reason had<br>fled?they were only the last struggles of Nature in her final extremity. After hang-<br>ing half an hour, the bodies were cut down and conveyed to Douglas for dissection.<p>Such an unusual circumstance in the Isle of Man excited considerable agitation;<br>no executions having taken place there tor the last thirty years.<p>In person, Camaish was of low stature, with heavy protruding eye brows, and of a<br>very forbiding countenance. The Coroner of Ayr Sheading being unable to find a [  ]<br>was obliged to execute the prisoners himself.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<p>Printed by John Muir Glassgow.</p>
