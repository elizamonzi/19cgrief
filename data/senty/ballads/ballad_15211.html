	<p> Execution<p>AND<p>Confession<p>An acconnt of the Execution of David<br>Dobie and John Thomson, at Edinburgh,<br>on Wednesday the 18th August, 1830,<br>with an account of their behaviour in<br>Jail and on the scaffold.<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wednesday, Aug. 18, 1830.<br>Shortly after seven o'clock this morning, the Magis-<br>trates attended by their officers, were admitted to the<br>Lock-up-house, where they found the two unfortunate<br>men in eager conversation with the clergymen, who<br>have since their condemnation, been almost their con-<br>stant visitors. Lheir minds seemed to be more settled<br>at this awful moment than what they were a few days<br>previous; this, we judge, was owing to the state in<br>which they were thrown in taking their last farewell<br>of their relations, who were admitted to see them.<br>Scenes such as these we may picture to ourselves, but<br>it is impossible to give a description; ?the parting of<br>Dobie with his wife and children was truly heart-<br>rending, and for a moment we forgot the brutality of<br>his crime in pity for the agouizing feelings of the un-<br>happy wife.<p>After their sentence, both of the criminals, although<br>sullen and quite, did not seem to be aware of the pro-<br>priety of applying themselves to the only fount from<br>whence hope and consolation was now to be derived,<br>and when spoken to on this head shewed the greatest<br>antipathy and ignorance on the subject. It was<br>thought adviseable, for more effectually impressing<br>their awful apd lost state on their minds, to separate<br>them, so that the one's attention could not be led away<br>by the discourse of the other;?this had the desired<br>effect, for both, from the, solitude of their condition,<br>txrned their thaughts inward, and the clergymen<br>afterwards found them both ready and willing to hear<br>and converse on tee means that was to prepare them<br>for their awful end, and their souls' welfare in the<br>world to come.<p>When any person spoke of the barbarous cruelty of<br>the deed which they committed, a shudder was observ-<br>ed to come over them, and th y more than once re-<br>peated, that being in a state of dismal intoxication<br>they were sensible afterwards of ill-using the woman<br>but to the brutal extent afterwards proved, they had<br>no recollection of. Alas! what a warning for drunk-<br>ards, Men to swallow a drug that brings them far be-<br>loG the most savage of the brute creation.<p>About 8 o'clock after a long conference with the<br>clergymen, and path tic prayers offered up for them,<br>the executioner made his appearance and commenced<br>pinioning the arms of both criminals. Lhey then left<br>the Lock-up-house, guarded by the town officers, and<br>a strong body of police. On the road to the scaffold,<br>and fora minute after asceneing, Dobie seemed as if<br>he was anxious to recognise some person, Lhe crowd<br>was immense, not a point from whence the scaffold<br>could be seen but what was taken up. After prayers<br>being put up, and a psalm sung, they mounted the drop,<br>and the executioner immediately adjusted the ropes;<br>they for a moment firmly grasped each others hand,<br>aud immediately after the signal was given, and they<br>were launched into eternity. <p>Dobbie was 28 years of age, and Thomson about 22.<br>both natives of Gilmerton, and from their being in the<br>habit of supplying the inhabitants with coals in small<br>quantities, were generally known in Edinburgh.<br>Dobbie. in being conveyed from the Calton hill Jail<br>last night about 5 o'clock, appeared not the least<br>moved, and mentioned the names of various persons he<br>saw from the Coach windows, in a kind of jocular<br>manner.<p>Dobbie  hod a  long conversation with .Dr Lee on the<br>scaftold, and drunk twice a little cold water.</p>
