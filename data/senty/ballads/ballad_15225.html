	<p> MANSIE WAUGH'S DREAM,<br>CONCERNING THE<br>Execution of Burke,<br>PART FIRST.<p>" My old and faithful servant, Tommy Bodkin,<br>had been long Thomas Bodkin,Master Tailor in <br>Dalkeith, but removed to Edinburgh,where, by his<br>skill in the craft,for which he owns himself indebt-<br> ed to me, he has acquired great fame as a Fashion-<br>able Tailor,and has a fair prospect of being Deacon<br>to the Corporation. About the New.year he brought<br>out Mrs Bodkin in a chaise, on a visit to me and<br>my Nanse at Lugton. A' the cracks in town and<br>countrybeingaboutthe West-Port Murders,we na-<br>turally fell upon that subject. Mr.Bodkin minded <br>what i though of the irishers langsyne. "But <br>did you ever think it would come to this?" said he.<br>Mrs Bodkin said,"Mr Wauch, you have never<br>come to see us inEdinburgh,ye maun positively&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>come and see the fair last show of that monster<br>Burke;our house is in the Lawnmarket,and ye'll<br>get a finesight frae the windows;ye'll take the <br>coach the night before, and get a bed with us: I<br>winna take a refusal."<p>"Iam very doubtful whether Icould stand sic <br>an awfu'sight ,for I canna thole to see our Nanse <br>draw a chuckie's neck for our Sunday's dinner,"said<br>I; "yet he is sic a monster, in the shape of a man,<br>that I think I could see him wagging in a tow, with <br>something like satisfaction."<p>To make a long tale short, I took my sent in the <br>coach,and found Mr. Bodkin waiting to meet me at <br>the office: he led me up the street on his honour-<br>ed master at his fire-side. Icannot describe the <br>grandeur of their house;mahogany chairs and ta-<br>bles,carpents and window-curtains, looking-glasses,<br>and what not,every thing more prejinet than <br>another. Losh me!sic grandeur for Mansie Waugh's<br> 'prentice.  As a proof of how the public feel about <br>that bloosy businees-they told me they were offer-<br>ed a guinea forevery one who could sit at their win- <br>dows and see the execution, but they prefered <br>obliging their friends and customers.  After a fine <br>supper, I got a grand bed, It might have served a <br>Duke; but I could not sleep for thinking about the <br>unhappy wretch-I had a kind of dover, but waken-<br>ed eerie, and was glad at heart when I saw the light <br>of day.  But, losh me ! when I went to the window <br>and looked to the street, from the Iron Kirk to the <br>Castle-hill, nothing but a sea of heads, and every <br>window full where they could get a glint of the gal-<br> lows ; and, I said, "I never saw the marrow of <br>that, except when the King was here; I find it is <br> the dame in the first sight of a monarch whom we <br>love, and a monstor whom we have."-"That's a <br>sensible observe,"  said a lady quoting something , <br>which I think she said from Shakspeare.  There <br>now rose a hurrah, which seemed to rend the air, <br>and we saw the wretch coming up Libberton's  Wynd. <br>Before he appeared, I thought I could lend a hand <br>to tear him in pices; but now that hi was before <br>me, and I thought in how short a time he would be <br>in eternity, and his doom sealed for ever, my heart <br>grew sair and dunted in my bosom.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When he <br>mounted the sealfold, my head became dizzy.--I saw <br>the rope put about his neck-my een dazzled-the <br>napkin-fell-I heard anither hurrah -I saw his legs <br>wagging-a cloud came over my sight, and I coupit <br>back in the floor as dead's a maw!  I canna say how <br>lang I was in the swarf, hor what passed ; but when <br>I was in the swarf, Nor what passed ; but when <br>I came to myself, a fine lady was holding a wec  <p>gowd box to my nose, and Mrs Bodkins, washing my <br>brow wi' cauld water.  But in alittle time there <br>rose up anither wild hurrah,  which made the flesh  <br>on my bones creep: I felt the dwawm like to come <br>o'er me again, when they told me the body was cut  <br>down and the crowd dispersing. <p>They now set the breakfast, and it was a weel <br>covered table ; that a Provost's couldna been better : <br>there was ham, eggs, and finnan haddies, biscuits  <br>and buttered toast, honey and jelly, tea and coffee,<br>and several things that I didna ken the names  o' ; <br>but, for a' the temtations, ne'er a bit would gang o'er <br>my craig.-I  grew sick, and had to leave the table, <br>passing a dreary day in bed, where I could think of <br>nothing but Burke: I got a' gliff o' sleep about  <br>gloamin', and the parlour, Imet half a <br>for I wakened about nine o'clock, as hungry as a<br>hawk. When I came into the parlour, I met half a<br>dozen o'gentlemen, who Mr. Bodkin said, were a' <br>fain to see me.  I found they had a' read my vo-<br>lume; they paid me many compliments, comparing  <br>me to authors of whom I had never heard, and say-<br>ing that my name would gang down to distant ages. <p>When we met in the dining-room, there was a  <br>super set in grand style, the very sight of it made <br>my mouth water, for I had fasted for near four and-<br>twenty hours. there was flesh and fish, cooked in <br>various ways, with sauces and pickles, pastry and <br>fruits. that I had never seen the like of ; alloa ale <br>and  London  porter, Holland and French brandy for <br>drams ; and when we had made a hearty supper, <br>we had two bowls of punch, one of Glenlivet Whisky, <br>and anither of Jamica rum.  My health was the <br>first toast after the king's : and it was drunkwith sic'<br>a clapping  o' hands and clattering o' heels, I kenn'd <br>na ' how t' look.  They then drank the Corporation <br>of Tailors , of which they said I was the most cele-<br>brated member except Ferdinand of spain, who <br>made a petticoat for the Virgin Mary.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But that <br>doesna make him a tailor - he's but a manty - maker <br>at the best," said I,  which produced a hearty laugh.<p>We then began to crack about the murders : and <br>they  a' speak their mind- about Burke and his gang, <br>of which they considered Dr. Knox a distinguished <br>member.  The verdict of the jury up a M'Dougal <br>was  a ferly to ane and a' o' the company ; and they <br>didna hesitate to say, that Mr. Cockburn drew the <br>blade o'er their con, and glamoured their gumption,<br>by dint of what they termed sophistical reasoning .<br>Even those who hold their beads high in office were <br>not spared,-the refusing to let Burke make a full<br>confession, and not permitting him to be seen, was  <br>bitterly spoken of.  The dispasting the turnkey for <br>disclosing the secrets "of the prison-house," they <br>said, had a strang  appearance ; of availing themselves <br>as if some folks were fondering of availing themselves<br>of the quibbles of the law. than of the administra-<br>tion of strict justice.  It was a burgied job at the <br>best; for. instead of probing the font rair to the bot-<br>tom, they wished to skin over the deep wound which <br>humanity and the honour of Edinburgh had received..<br>"Hout, man ," said anither; "there's reasons for <br>every thing, and there's wheels within wheels mair<br>than you think of."&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "That maybe,"  said the first ; <br>"but such conduct by some winna be soon forgot-<br>ten and Iwonder they can sleep sound in their beds,<br>considering the clamour against them, and the state <br>of the public mind." <p>TO BE CONTINUED.<br>Published by W. Smith, No. 3, Bristo Port.<p>MANSIE WAUGH'S DREAM,<br>Concerning the Execution<br>OF<br>BURKE.<br>PART SECOND.<p>We had a long jolly night of it, but my head&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  <br>began spinning like a peerie, and I thought a* the&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  <br>room rinning round about, when Mrs Bodkin kindly&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  <br>bade her gudeman take me to my bed.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It was a<br>considerable time before  I could sleep, for though&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  <br>we had been a' hearty and happy, I thought I saw<br>Burke just at the fatal moment between time and <br>elernity, and the wild  unearthly yells of the multi-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>tude still rang in my lugs.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Howsoever, at length<br>and lang I fell asleep, but, Heaven preserve me frae <br>sic anither night !&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For I had a dream so dreadful,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>that it excelled a' I ever heard of read of.  There's  <br>a chapter in my book called " The Awfu' Night," <br>but that is but mere mockery towhat I suffered on<br>this occasion, and I wadna wish my greatest enemy <br>mair punishment, than a dream as dreadful as mine.<br>I shall set down some particulars, but it defies a' the <br>powers of my pen to describe its horrors, and there <br>may be some things inconsistent like, but the reader <br>will keep in mind it was a dream.<p>I thoght I had been bousin' wi' some o' the Pro-<br>fessors o' the College and was comin' doun the <br>West Port, when my head grew dizzy and heart sick ,<br>which caused me to learn my back to the wa'.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I <br>thought  a man came to me and got me wheedled to  <br>take haud o' his arm an gang wi' him, but like a  <br>I got better; I could nae speak to him, but, like a <br>simpleton, I went with him, and he led me in a <br>dark close, where we entered a wierdless like house ; <br>and when I looked at him in the light, Gude gra-  <br>cious ! my heart died within me, for I kent him to <br>be Burke ! and the wretch M'Dougal, with anither <br>man, (the wretch Hare,) were sitting at the fireside.<br>My blood ran cauld in my veins-I thought my <br>heart grippit like as if it had been screwed in a <br>smith's vice ;  every hair in my head stood up like <br>green rashes in a bog ; my flesh creepit on  my bones ;  <br>and believing my last hour was come, I said to my-<br>self, "Lord , have mercy on my soul !"  Hare left <br>the  house, and I thought it was for no good.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How-<br>ever, I sought a drink o' water,and that brought <br>me round a wee, and I began to think it possible,<br>by the help of God, to escape: I took out a shulling,<br>and said to Burke, "If you could get half a mutch-<br>kin of good whisky, I think a dram would recover <br>me;" thinking if I got one out, I would try to <br>manage the tither.  Burke went for the whisky, and <br>just when Iwas rising, the she-devil came behind<br>me, rugged me by the coat-tail back owre on the <br>floor, and in a second of time was lying above my <br>breast, with a weight like a millstone, her one hand <br>on my mouth and the other at my thrapple, so that <br>I had no powerto cry.  Anither minute would have <br>done the job, but I thought if I could feinzie being  <br>dead, she would maybe rise;so I turned up my een, <br>and shot out my legs, like one in the dead-thraws, <br>and there I layseemingly as dead as a herring. <br>The hag had me stripped skin-naked ere any oxe <br>came in- Hare was the first with a long  muckle <br>kist; thinks I. that's my coffin. They coupit me <br>into it without difficulty, for I'm a little man, and <br>before Burke came in the lid was closed.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He sat <br>down on it with the whisky, and, by a merciful Pro-<br>vidence, his weight dang a hole in it, which let in&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<p>air to keep me alive. They agreed t' get a porter<br>directly, as Dr Knox was waiting, and had promised<br>to pay them that night<p>In a situation like mine, minutes were like months<br>in duration ; and I wearied salt for the porter; for I<br>had once dined with Dr Knox, and had some hope<br>that, if I were beside him, I had a fair chance for<br>my life, if I had pith and power to dunt upon the<br>kist-lid.  Weel, the porter came, got a dram, and<br>was told to bring back the kist immediately, as they<br>had occasion for it that night.  I was hoisted on his <br>back, and he trudged at a quick step. The kist was<br>carried directly into the dissecting room ; Burke,<br>Hare, directly into the dissecting room; Burke, <br>laid on the dissecting-table. Glad was I to breathe<br>the air, though it was neither sweet nor fresh, for<br>there was a fearful ngsome smell. The bruits got<br>ten pounds as the price of my blood, and Dr Knox<br>pushed them out. When they were gone, he looked<br>steadfastly in my face with a candle, and said, <br>" David, this is Mansie Wauch, the Tailor in Dal.<br>keith, who is the author of the curious book that we <br>were reading the other night; he is an original; he<br>has made more noise in the world than all the frater-<br>nity of Tailors from the earliest generations; his scull <br>alone is worth ten guineas to any Phrenological Lec-<br>turer : when they went away they locked the door,<br>and left me in the dark with so many instruments<br>of death around me, that a cauld sweat stood on every<br>pore of my  skin.  When I reflected that he had paid<br>ten pounds for my carcase, and counted upon get- <br>ting ten guineas for my harm-pan, my hopes in his <br>mercy vanished like the morning dew. I thought I<br>was only out o' the frying - pan into the fire; or, as <br>we say, frae the de'il to the deep sea. I thought<br>upon Nanse, left a sorrowful, forlorn widow, and<br>knives.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  However, I tried to put up a petition to<br>Him wha hears always, and from whom no dark-<br>ness can hide; and I said, " Lord, in thy mercy,<br>hear and deliver me from this man of blood-this<br>uncircumcisedPhillistine!"<p>The Doctor came in with a candle,  looking for<br>something ; he took up legs and arms, whistling a' the  <br>they defy expression.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, I thought the Doc.<br>ter was an honourable man ; and I felt, that if never <br>there was a chance of getting out o' the glede's grips,<br>now was a chance of getting out o' the glede's grips, <br>and roared out  " Murder-murder ! I'm&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Burked,<br>but I&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;winna be&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Knoxed-Murder !"&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The  awfu'<br>consternation  I was in made me try to rise ; and I<br>thought I rowed aff the table, playing thump on the <br>floor. The fallwakened me from my dream, but I <br>didna ken where I was still Mr and Mrs Bodkin <br>come rinning up with a light, and found me spraw-<br>ling on the carpet, and looking as wild as a wild cat-<br>It wasna aneasy job for them to convince me I was<br>safe, and make me sensible of my situation, and I<br>wasna myself for four-and-twenty hours after.-at<br>the moment  I write this, my heart dunts, and the<br>blood rins cauld in  my body.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Some folk may say<br>there's nae rationality in the thing, but we canna <br>aye command our waking thought, and manna ox-<br>pect reason in a dream."<p>(CONCLUDED.)<br>Published by W.
