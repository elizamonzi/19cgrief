	<p> STRANGE  AND WONDERPULL<p>A P  P A R I T I O N S<p>That was see in the Air, over the  most Parts of E U R O P E on March Lost<br>1719. but' more Particularly, in SCOT LAND, 'ENGLAND,<br>FRANCE, and SPAIN. with same Remarks thereon<p>THE Great Lightnings which was seen in the Clouds in March last, in this Part<br>and in othere pans of Scotland,a. England; hath been much more observabl<br>mother pans of Europe&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of which we have gotten a True and Particular<br>Account, by Letters teem France and spain, from them who were Eye Wit-<br>nesses of these Apparitions.<p>Upon the 19th, March last, at Aberdeen in the North of Scotland, about Nine a Clock<br>at Night  there appeared in the Air, a great Lightning amongst the Clouds, which<br>were of divers Colours, as Red, Yellow, Green, &c. And there was great Flaughs of<br>Fireamongst the Clouds, which issued out from them like Sheets enfolding one ano<br>ther ; tne People to theii appearance thought that the Cloud touched the Earth, and<br>Came down with a great Noise, which made many of the beholders run into their Hou.<br>ses, for fear the Fire should have devoured them.<p>Upon the 19th of March last, 1719, there was seen in the Air, over the City of<br>Glasgow a great and surpriseing Light of several Coulers, and immediatly thereafter<br>thereappeared as it were a large Flaming Sword to the amazement of all Spectators,<br>and imnediaily vanished, then immediatly appeared two great Fires which was very<br>dreadfull to tehold, tor the Fire come to the Very Grownd<p>Upon the first April last, there was seen over the City of Paris in France,about<br>E ght a Clock in the Evining, a large kind of Comet, which shew'd such a great Light,<br>as if it had been the Sun at Noon. Day ; The Inhabitants wondering to see  such an un-<br>usuall sight, were wonderfully Afraid; And while they were beholding it hanging in<br>the Air, it brust asunder, and came down like Rays of Fire above the City, the People<br>being astonished at the sight thereof, thought it would have set the, whole City on Fire;<br>The last Thursday at Wrexham, within Eight Miles of West Chester in England, be.<br>tween Nine and ten a Clock at Night, the Sky on the South West part of the Moon,<br>was observed on a sudden be of divers Colours, as Red , Green , Yellow, &c. And soon<br>afer, a Large Furry Ball appeared in the Clouds so very bright that the People of the;<br>Town, thought all their Houses were on Fire, and ran into the Steets, where they<br>saw the Ball burst and fall to the Earth, exactly like a Sky Rocket, with a longtrain of <br>Fire, it gave sucn a Light, that one would have seen the smallest Prine lying on the<br>Streets, it continued a little time after the Ball was seen; the Inhabitants were very<br>much terrified at the Sight thereof.<p>The same Night, at the City of Oxford in England, about  that same  time of Night<br>there Appeared a great Fire in the Air, and little afterwards, they heard a Discharge of<br>above Hundred Cannon, at which several of the Inhabitants were Frightned into Fits;<br>It was just above their Heads,and they saw as it were Smoak,coming out of the Mouth<br>of the Cannons; and they heard a great noise like an Army shouting for Victory. It so<br>Terrified some of the Inhabitaots, that they are still besides themselves, and there<br>is little hope of their Recovery. I have this Account from the Vice-Chancellour, of<br>Magdalen College in Oxfoord.<p>Turney  April  the 5th 1719, you have a full and true Account of the dreadfull Fire<br>which came down upon Rounesend and Burnt 510 Houses, and 12 person Burnt by<br>that dreadfull Fire.<p>We may behold (if we be not willfully Wind ) that the LORD oftentimes lets us see<br>his Wonders and Signs in the Air above, and on the Earth, and in the Sea-, and all<br>for our Instrucflion, that we may learn to turn from our Evil Ways unto Him, and<br>so escape the just Judgment of GOD, that hangs over our Heads for our Sins, and not<br>to be like the misbelieving Jews, before the Destruction of Jerusalem, who saw suck<br>like Signs above their City, and yer they hardned their Hearts, and would not believe<br>their approaching Danger, untill the Judgements threatned came upon them, and sweepr<br>ed them put of thtir own Land ; Which may serve for a Caution to all of us, to break<br>off from our Sins, and turn to the LORD, who is able and willing to save as from<br>these Judgements, which our Sins do justly deserve.<p>FINIS.</p>
