	<p> THE GILMERTON MURDERERS<p><p>Here you have the Melancholy and Penitent  Address to the Public,<br>by David Dobie and John Thomson, dated from their Cells in the<br>Calton  Jail, where they are now awaiting the execution of their sen-<br>tence on Wednesday morning next;?and also, an affecting Letter<br>written by David Dobie to his Wife.<p><p>Melancholy Address of Dobie and Thomson, with Dobie's Letter<p>to his Wife.<p>The following is the copy of a letter, wrote by David Dobie to his<br>wife, and to the Father of the unfortunate woman whom they mur-<br>dered:?<p>" Dear Wife?I write these lines to you, hoping you may receive<br>some consolation from them. This is the only comfort that I can be-<br>stow, to let you know the state of my mind ; although my guilt does<br>stare me in the face, I trust God will be merciful to me a humble peni-<br>tent ; although my hands are stained with the blood of the innocent,<br>I trust the blood of Christ will wash me from all my guilt.<p>" I am quite resigned to my fate ; I forgive all mine enemies, and <br>I trust they will also forgive me ; I die in peace with all men. You<br>will not have the melancholy satisfaction of laying my body in the<br>dust; but I beg as a last request that you do not grieve on that ac-<br>count, as these dry bones may yet live to future glory, where man<br>cannot scatter. Shew this letter to the aged father of Margaret Pa-<br>terson, whose hoary head we have brought with sorrow to the grave.<br>We sincerely implore his forgivenness, which is a poor consolation<br>for the loss of a daughter he held so dear, which, by our wicked hearts<br>has left him to bewail the loss of a child, and you a faithless hus-<br>band.<p>" Give my last respects to all my friends and comrades, and to the<br>grace of God I leave them and you for ever.?Farewell."<p>" Edinburgh Jail, 28th July.<p>" With sorrow we announce to the Public and our comrades who<br>know us,?though the enormity of our crimes is already known in<br>part, which were of the rudest and deepest dye?with regret we may<br>state that our brutal crime was one in which there was neither manli-<br>hood nor shame, for the unfortunate female came with us for protec-<br>tion, but like Judas we betrayed trust, and imbrued our hands in the<br>blood of the innocent, which is now required at our hands, and a guilty<br>conscience stares us in the face. Such are the horrors we endure with-<br>in this gloomy solitary cell. Solitary indeed is our dwelling; by our<br>guilty deeds we are hid from the face of man ; no more the blessed<br>sun may cheer us with his light ; our end is decreed, in judgment for<br>our own wicked lust and wicked hands. We sinned in secret, but the<br>voice of our sister's blood cried from the ground that we should be<br>punished openly. Disgraceful indeed were our doings, and an out-<br>rage to all proper feelings in society. But alas ! remorse comes too<br>late ; our sandglass is turned; and the numbered hours of our life are<br>swiftly running; every throbbing pulse announces their fleetness, and<br>our beating hearts our guilt. No more shall we behold the beams of<br>the morning, nor feel the evening dew fall upon us; we water our<br>couch with tears. Fettered with chains of iron, but alas, loaded still<br>heavier with the chains of sin, that sink to perdition, we must suffer an <br>ignominious death, and be publicly anatomised ; to the shame and dis-<br>tress of our agonised parents, whom we should have held dear to us,<br>and been the means of supporting in their declining years, The sen-<br>tence of an earthly judge we fear not, he can only kill the body; but<br>there is another trial before us, by that infinite Judge that will give to<br>every man according to his works, and hath said, ' Cursed is every<br>man that hangeth on a tree.' But yet our hope is in a merciful God,<br>and should this come into the hands of any individual, who like us is<br>plunged in vice of the most horrid and abandoned nature, shunning<br>all the paths of virtue, and lost to every thing that is becoming and<br>laudable in this world, think, O think in time.<p>"When&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;we  recal  to mind  the  many  idle spent Sabbaths-the<br>Church we often neglected, and passed it by as if it were a ruinous<br>heap, and making scoff of such as attended it while we went into the<br>public house, and were there wallowing in all the abominations the<br>human mind can picture?we now, like Dive,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;' Lift  up our eyes and<br>see Lazarus afar off in the bosom of Abraham comforted,  while  we<br>are tormented,'&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But we thank  God we are not yet in  hell,  which we<br>have so often escaped ;  a guilty  conscience and death, with all its<br>ghastly terrors staring us in the face, is but a faint picture of the hor-<br>rible thoughts that distract our minds regarding our future fate, when<br>our guilt confronts us in all its direful forms.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Were we to breathe<br>our last on a death-bed, surrounded by those who were dear to us, and<br>our hands unstained with blood, it would be nothing in comparison to<br>going to the scaffold with such a load of crime upon our heads, and<br>dying by the hands of the executioner.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  Oh that it were in our power<br>to  recal  that mis spent time  which we have squandered away in the<br>paths of vice.  Had we a thousand worlds, or all the filthy allurements<br>attendant upon them, it would make no compensation for our guilt<br>and waste of time which cannot be recalled into eternity.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  We sin-<br>cerely trust that this our dying advice will have a lasting effect upon<br>our comrades, and  those who are running headlong in the ways of sin,<br>making the Sabbath a pastime and a day of unhallowed pleasure, and<br>beholding the Bible as a looking glass ; for which, you may depend,<br>it not repented of, an account will be required here after,"<p>Forbes and  Owen, Printers, 118, High Street.</p>
