	<p> EXECUTION.<p>A Full and True Account of the Last Speech and Dying Declaration<br>of WILLIAM BURKE, who was Executed at Edinburgh this morn-<br>ing, for Murder, and his body given for dissection ; also of his<br>conduct and behaviour since his condemnation, and on the<p>Scaffold.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Edinburgh, 28th January, 1829.<p>About nine o'clock this morning, WILLIAM  BURKE, the wretched<br>miscreant, who had occupied so much of public attention since his<br>condemnation, on account of the unheard of atrocities disclosed at<br>his trial, suffered the penalty of the law due for the commission of<br>such barbarous and enormous crimes, at the head of Libberton<br>Wynd, Lawnmarket, in the presence of an immense multitude of<br>spectators, many of whom came from a great distance.<p>The indictment charged Burke and M' Dougal, his reputed wife,<br>but to whom he was not married, with three different acts of deli-<br>berate murder, between the 7th April, and 31st October last, viz.....<br>Mary Paterson or Mitchell, James Wilson, alias Daft Jamie, and<br>Marjory Campbell or Docherty. The trial then proceeded for the<br>murder of Docherty only, to which they both pied not Guilty.<br>William Hare and Margaret Laird, his wife, accomplices in the<br>murders, were admitted King's evidence.<p>After a long and very interesting trial, which lasted nearly<br>twenty four hours, and which excited the strongest sensations of<br>horror and disgust in the minds of all present, the jury' found<br>William Burke Guilty, and the libel not proven against M' Dougal ;<br>upon hearing this, Burke turned round to his paramour, and coolly<br>exclaimed, " Nelly, your are out of the scrape." After a few obser-<br>vatioas by Lord  Meadowbank, in which Lord M' Kenzie concur-<br>red, the Lord Justice Clerk addressed Burke, in a most impressive<br>manner, setting forth in the strongest language, the enormity of the<br>crime of which he was now convicted ; " a crime, more atrocious,<br>a more cold-blooded, deliberate, and systematic preparation for<br>murder, and the motives so paltry, (said his Lordship,) was really<br>unexampled in the annals of the country," and assuring him that<br>his sentence would most positively be carried into execution; and<br>solemnly warning him to prepare his mind in the most suitable<br>manner to appear before the Throne of Almighty God to answer<br>for his crimes. He was then sentenced to be executed on Wednes-<br>day morning, the 28th January, 1829, between the hours of eight<br>and ten o'clock, and his body to be given for dissection.<p>Since  his condemnation this unhappy man was perfectly peni-<br>tent and resigned to his fate.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He never deluded himself with any<br>hopes of escape or of mercy ; and accordingly, he&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;immediately<br>prepared himself for confession and for receiving absolution, by a<br>perusal of such  books  as  his&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;spiritual  guides had&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;put  into-his<br>hands, and by listening with the most devout attention to their re-<br>ligious instructions.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He fully acknowledged the justice of his sen-<br>tence ; nay,  he considered  it in  some measure as a blessing, the<br>certainty of his approaching fare having brought back his mind to<br>a true sense of religion, from which it had been long estranged, and<br>he wished to die at peace with all men.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He made a full confession<br>of all the murders he was guilty of, condescending on no less than<br>sixteen persons, beginning with Old Abigail Simpson, from Loan-<br>head, and ending with Marjory Campbell or Docherty, and all with-<br>in the short space of nine months ; mentioning their names, sex, and<br>age, in so far as he knew them, and the dates at which they were<br>dispatched, which was generally by suffocation, as well as to whom<br>sold, and the price received for the bodies.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He said they all made<br>very little resistance, being generally, if not always, very much in-<br>toxicated with spirits.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What induced him to commence this hor-<br>rible traffic in blood, was, he  said,  Hare and him having received<br>L. 7, 10s. for the body of an old  Pensioner who died in Hare's<br>house, and which,  at Hare's suggestion, they took to Surgeons<br>Square,<p>Accordingly, about eight this morning, he was waited upon by the officiating<br>Magistrates at the Lock-up-house, where he had previously been brought from Jail,<br>and soon after proceeded to the scaffold up Libberton Wynd, attended by two<br>Catholic Clergymen. After some time spent in prayer kneeling, he mounted the<br>fatal drop, (after shaking hands with those around him,) the rope being then adjust-<br>ed, and the cap drawn over his face, he in a few moments gave the signal, and was<br>instantly launched into eternity. After hanging the usual time he was cut down,<br>and sent to the College for dissection.<p>PRICE ONE PENNY.</p>
