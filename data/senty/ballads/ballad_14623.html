	<p> EXECUTION<p>An account of the Execution of<br>Robert Emond, who was executed this<br>morning March 17, 183O, at the Head<br>of Libberton's Wynd. for the Murder<br>of Mrs Franks and her Daughter at<br>Haddington, in October last.<p>This morning, Wednesday 17th March, Robert Emond suffered<br>the last sentence of the law, at the-usual place of execution, head<br>of Libberton's wynd.<p>Since this unhappy culprit's trial, he has at different times made<br>various confessions of his guilt, and the reasons which prompted<br>him to commit the horrid deeds. He seems to have had brought<br>himself to think that he was utterly despised by Mrs Franks and<br>his wife and on being opposed by them in any of his foolish specu-<br>lations in trade, although for his own ultimate good, was consider-<br>by him as resulting- from that deep-rooted apathy, as he thought,<br>they treated him with. Thus circumstance after circumstance only<br>served still more to impress upon his bewildered mind the false<br>ideas with which he nourished it, and at last so overpowering were<br>their fell effects, that, revenge now took full possession of his breast.<br>It would appear from his confessions, that he had no intention to<br>take the life of Magdalene Franks, but after having committed the<br>one deed, he, to avoid discovery, committed the second. His<br>sister repeatedly visited him in the jail; she had come to Edin-<br>burgh previous to the trial; her visits were in no ways made to<br>console her guilty brother, but rather  to grapple at any effects he-<br>was in possession of, as she said to pay the heavy expence to which<br>she had been put in attending his trial, &c. His brother, a blind<br>man, was very much affected at meeting and parting with him.<br>His mother, about ten days back, came to Edinburgh, and some<br>affecting scenes passed between them; she seems to have had more<br>partiality for Emond than the rest of her family, she is about 70,<br>and get home in better health than was anticipated.<p>Different reports were spread  about of Emond's attempts to<br>commit suicide, which, from his manner and restlessness, we have<br>no doubt but he would have done so, but. in addition to his being-<br>strongly ironed, watchmen were placed with him night and day,<br>and the strictest search made on the persons of any of his friends<br>who were admitted to him;?in fact he could not make the least<br>motion or move himself, but the eyes of his watchers were on him.<br>Indeed, one attempt was made to convey a deadly poison to him-<br>by a&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;near&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;female&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;relation,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but she was immediately detected.<br>Emond shewed repeatedly what mast be the awful state of a mur-<br>derer's mind.<p>His nights were passed in broken slumbers, from which he gen-<br>erally awaked in hurried starts, betraying an awful state of mind<br>wich he felt himself quite unable to describe&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the daytime beex-<br>hibited the same restlessness and uneasine ss, and  was  haunted  by<br>the phantoms of his bleeding victims, untill his  mind, overwhelmed<br>by midnight visions and day  dreams of guilt  and  punishment, be-<br>came excited to a state bordering on frenzy, under the  influence of<br>which he talked wildly and incoherently ; but these paroxyms were<br>seldom of a long continuance, as he generally found  relief in tears.<br>and when his mind was somewhat eased,  he resumed his natural<br>manner.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He did not seem much concerned  when the  murder  of<br>Mrs Franks was mentioned, but whenever the name of Magdalene<br>Franks was mentioned or the idea came  across  his  mind, he was<br>immediately seized with the  most dreadful fits of despair,, and&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ex-<br>claimed, 'The innocent blood calls for vengeance.'<p>He payed attention to the clergy and others who spoke to him on<br>religious matters, and received them with great civility, and even<br>dwelt upon the subjects stated, with a kind of seeming inward<br>pleasure. He had some. peculiar opinions of his own, which, though<br>absurd, he strongly dinged to.<p>Emond was previously brought from the Calton Jail to the Lock-<br>up-house. He was awakened about 6 o'clock, and spent the time<br>till nearly 8 preparing himself for his Awful end. When he was<br>told the magistrates were in readiness for him, he quietly submitt-<br>ed to his arms being- fastened. They moved op Libbertons a Wynd<br>at a few minutes past 8 ; the crowd assembled wa.s great, and a<br>general movement was made when be ascended the scaffold, A<br>short time only was spout  in prayer. &c. when be mounted the drap<br>and on giving the signal was instantly launched  into eternity.<p></p>
