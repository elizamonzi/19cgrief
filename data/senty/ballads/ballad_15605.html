	<h2>Transcription</h2>
	<p> A Full and prticular Account of five<br>Men that were executed at London,<br>for raising a dreadful Mob, in the<br>Behalf of the Pretender.<p><p>S I R,<p>Every honest Man is sensible how unjustly the Rebellious Faction complains of<br>Cruelty, when any of their Number is punished according to Law, for such<br>Crimes as in all civiliz'd Nations are reckoned to be expiable no other ways than by<br>Death. They bewail mightily the Fate of those Five Rebellious Wretches that<br>were carried from Newgate in two Carts, to a Gibbet set up at the End of Salsbu-<br>ry Court in Fleet-Street, where they were all executed in Sight of the Mug-House<br>which they had demolished, and of many Thousand Spectators, and no doubt they<br>will insert them among others of the Rebels in the High-Church Calendar of Mar-<br>tyrs.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<p>How little Compassion the High-Church Mobs have upon those whom it is in their<br>Power to Insult, is very well known throughout this City and Suburbs, but there is<br>one flagrant Instance of their Barbarity, that has not yet been taken notice of in the<br>Publick Prints, which I hope you'l insert as follows.<p>On the 4th, 5th, and 17th of November last a Jacobite Mob attack'd the<br>House of Francis Hoar at rhe Wbittingtons Chat in Chick- Lane. They consisted of<br>at wretched a Crew as ever assembled on such Occasions, and they singled out that<br>Man's House, because he had always been firm to the Protestant Succession, and in<br>his Way expressed his Zeal for it. They attack'd it in the usual Manner, by Sur-<br>prize, and with so great Fury, that they broke ail his Windows of a sudden, with<br>their usual Cry, Down with the House; knock the Rogue and Ms Family on the Head.<br>Or mond for ever. No King George, &c. There being very little Company in the<br>House, the Man was not able to make a Defence ; But one of his Neighbours seeing<br>the Mob so outragious, fired among them in Defence of the House, and wounded one<br>of the Mob. Upon this some High-Church Constables, with Assistants of the same<br>Stamp, who did not take the least Care to suppress the Mob, came immediately, and<br>without any Warrant carry'd Mr. Hoar, his Wife and Daughter to New-Prison, for<br>pretended Murder, tho' the Shot did not proceed from their House, nor was the<br>Wound given to the Rioter Mortal, and he soon after perfectly recovered. These<br>Constables &c. were so inhumane, that they would not leave one Person in the House<br>to look after it, tho' Mrs Hoar did earnestly beg it of them, but instead of that,<br>were so very officious, that they carried some People that came in accidentally for<br>Drink, along with them to Prison, and charg'd them also with the Murder.<p>Upon this Mr. Hoar was bound over, and Indicted for a Riot, but was acquitted<br>upon Tryal before the Right Honourable Lord Justice Parker<p>The Faction being thus disappointed of their just Revenge upon Mr. Hoar, they<br>have since, according to their usual Methods. incensed his Creditors against him,<br>and particularly his Brewer, who has arrested and committed him to Ludgate.<p>The Jacks in the Neighbourhood were so malicious, and did so insult Mrs. Hear<br>and her Children, that they could not go about their Lawful Occasions, so that the<br>was oblibed to remove to the Queens Head in Smithfield ; but being still pursued by<br>the Malice of the Jacks, who dissuaded every Body they cou'd from going to the<br>House, her Husband and the with six Children are reduced to a starving Condition,<br>and have nothing to subsist on but the Charity of well affected Persons, tho' Mr.<br>Hoar had once very good Business both in his House, and by felling of Cattle in<br>Smithfield: but ever since the Rise of Sacheverels Mobs in the last Reign, he his<br>been the But of their Malice, which depriv'd him of his Way of Living.<p>LONDON Printed, and EDINBURGH Re-Printed.</p>
