	<p> Shocking<p>DEPRAVITY!<p>A Full and authentic account of the most Shocking<br>Case of Depravity on record in the annals of the<br>history of this Kingdom, which took place in the vi-<br>cinity of Airdrie, on Sabbath morning, the 2d June<br>instant, by six Monsters in the shape of human<br>beings !<p>The following account of this most deplorable case is copied from<br>the Glasgow Free Press Newspaper, which exceeds any thing of the<br>kind that we remember ever to have read or heard of. That six<br>persons, who consider themselves men, should be found in our<br>boasted civilized and enlightened country, in our day, to lend their<br>united assistance for such a diabolical purpose as is here described,<br>is beyond all credibility, and makes our very blood run cold !<p>On the evening of Saturday last, a labourer and his wife, residing<br>at or near Kipps, on the line of the Glasgow and Kirkintilloch rail<br>road, had occasion to be in Airdrie, making some purchases for the<br>family, and being late in getting payment of their wages, and con-<br>sequently, later than usual in getting their marketing finished, were<br>proceeding in a homeward direction about eleven or twelve o'clock<br>at night, when by some preconcerted scheme, two villains, under the<br>pretence of being constables, seized the husband and dragged him<br>towards the jail.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The  poor woman,  meanwhile, alarmed for her<br>children, and assured that her husband would speedily follow, ven-<br>tured to return alone, when four accomplices in the diabolical plot<br>came forward, and pretending to commiserate her hapless situa-<br>tion, proposed escorting her homewards in safety, by a nearer path<br>than the ordinary road.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Seeing so many apparent friends around<br>her, and being anxious to reach home as quickly as possible, she,<br>unconscious of danger, consented to be guided by them.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The road<br>chosen by these monsters, lay through an extensive park, and led to<br>the corner or wing of a plantation ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;thither they bent their way,<br>and&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It would harrow the feelings of the most hardened, and<br>shock the ears of the most indelicate, to narrate the details of the un-<br>fortunate woman's struggle, and the beastly treatment she experien-<br>ced at the hands of these unmanly ruffians ;  suffice it to say, that<br>that the party employed to capture the husband, left him so soon as<br>they considered their accomplices had got his wife fairly out of the<br>way.?The injured husband, on regaining his liberty, hurried home,<br>and found, indeed his children, but his wife was nowhere to be seen.<br>A glimmering of suspicion flashed across his mind.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Having pro-<br>cured the assistance of a neighbour, the husband rushed out, mad-<br>dened with rage, and not knowing whither he went?inquiry seem-<br>ed useless.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  By the merest accident, however, he discovered his<br>abused partner at the corner of the aforesaid plantation as the clock<br>struck three on the Sabbath morning?her clothes torn to tatters?<br>her limbs lacerated?her little stock of provisions and clothes Car-<br>ried off, and her body nearly inanimate.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thus has been perpetrated<br>in the vicinity of Airdrie another of the most monstrous and diabo-<br>lical deeds on record; and with shame let it be said by persons re-<br>siding in, or belonging to the town, and persons too who are notori-<br>ously known ; though they have for the present fled.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The case of<br>the Gilmerton Carters bears no parallel to the foregoing in point of<br>deliberate atrocity.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The injured  woman is respectably connected,<br>and we are happy to add is gradually recovering.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Procurator<br>fiscal has been apprised of the case, so that in the course of a few<br>days, we may expect to hear of the apprehension of the offenders,-?<br>Glasgow Free Press.<p>Menzies, Printer, Lawnmarket, Edinburgh.</p>
