	<p> MILLING<p>AMONG<p>The Fair Sex!<p>A Full and Particular Account of that Gallant and<br>most Extraordinary BATTLE, that was Fought on<br>Thursday last, 30th day of June, 1825, in the<br>Market Place of Aberdeen, between a Soldier's<br>Wife, and a Dandy young Fish Wife, at that place.<p>ON Thursday last a scene, very rarely witnessed here, although<br>among the Billingate  Ladies in the south, it is nothing un-<br>common,  accured  in  the Fish market in this Town.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It was  not<br>premeditated, and  therefore there  was no betting on either  side<br>though there might be several of the fancy present.<p>A Soldier's wife having, as is often the case, accasion to go to the<br>market to lay out her scanty pittance in the most beneficial and<br>economical manner, by some means or other, fell into a dispute<br>with a young aspiring dandy Fish wife, to whom she applied an<br>epithet, which it may be as well not here to repeat; suffice it to<br>say, that it had the effect of rousing all the Amazonian courage in<br>the blood of her antagonist. The insulted dame considered it her<br>imperative duty to vindicate her character and respectability, and<br>instantly rushed on her traducer, and gave her such a blow on the<br>breast, that sent her a reeling among the creels of the fish women.<br>The Soldier's wife, loth to be behind, and also considering the whole<br>British army to be grossly insulted in her person, gave the retort<br>uncourteous, when instantly a ring was formed by the females in<br>the market, and a regular set to commenced.<p>The dreadful conflict now commenced in grand stile, and if they<br>could not boast of using so much science as was lately displayed in<br>this neighbourhood, by Robinson and Crosbie, they certainly shew-<br>ed they were real game, and produced, at least, as much claret. The<br>Battle continued a considerable time, neither of the eombatants<br>seeming inclined to give it up; but the Soldier's wife, who seemed<br>to have most wind, as well as better science, snatching up a Native<br>from her opponent's creel, by a dexterious man?uvre, thrust it, tail<br>foremost, down her rivals throat. This, for the fish woman, was a<br>complete finisher; she fell in a moment, and instantly grew black<br>in the face ; and, if she had not been relieved by some of the by-<br>standers on the instant, she must have been choked.<p>Her resuscitation, however, served only to renew her rrge, and<br>encrease her courage, and they were about to set to afresh, with as<br>much appearance af vigour and strength as at the beginning, when<br>a Town Officer, who had got notice of the affray, made his appear-<br>ance, and with much difficulty, separated them. The condition of<br>both the amazons was truly disgraceful, and said little for the hu-<br>manity of the spectators.<p>Edinburgh; Printed for Alexander Turnbull....Price One Penny.</p>
