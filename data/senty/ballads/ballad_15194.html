	<p> A Full and Particular Account of the Trial and Sen-<br>tence of HUGH M'MILLAN, and EUPHEMIA<br>M' MILLAN, this last of whom is to be Executed<br>at Edinburgh on Wednesday the 23d January,<br>1828, for the Murder of Archibald Campbell,<br>Teacher of Dancing in Edinburgh, by throwing<br>Vitriol in his face, in consequence of which he<br>died in great agony.<p>ON Monday last, the 17th instant, came on be<br>fore the High Court of Justiciary, the trial of<br>Hugh M'Millan, and Euphemia Lawson, or M'-<br>Millian, his wife, for murder, in so far as they did,<br>on the 17th of October last, throw upon the head,<br>face, and other parts of the body, of the now de-<br>ceaaed Archibald Campbell, Painter, and Teacher<br>of Dancing, in the High Street, of Edinburgh, a<br>quantity of sulphuric acid or other corosive or burn-<br>ing'substance, with the intent to murder, maim, or<br>disfigure the said Archibald Campbell, so that he<br>died in the Royal Infirmrry, on the 30th of the<br>said month of October.<p>The pannels both pled not guilty, Doctors Adams,<br>Nisbett, and Christison, gave evidence as to the ap-<br>pearance of Campbell's body and clothes on examin-<br>ation in the Royal Infirmary, and Mr Sheriff Tait<br>deponed as to the deceased's disposition taken by<br>him in the said institution, a great number of wit-<br>tnesses were then esamined, who stated that vitriol<br>or other corosive substance had been thrown in<br>Campbell's face late on Wednesday night, from the<br>house of M'Millian, Mrs Campbell deponed that<br>Mrs M' Millian came into the deceased's house that<br>afternoon, and threw on the floor a chair that was<br>laid across the door to prevent the child from fall-<br>ing down stairs, saying ---- him, what was he ab-<br>out with his lauburrows. Now a Police Officer<br>was sent for, and Mrs M'Millian was taken to the<br>Office, she afterwards said I'll do for you now, se-<br>veral other witnesses were, afterwards examined,<br>who proved the fatal liquid was thrown from the<br>door of M'Million's house upon the unfortunate<br>victim of their revenge.<p>The Honourable Mr Leslie addressed the Jury<br>on behalf of M'Millian, and said that he had al-<br>ways maintained a good character, and that it might<br>be of importance to him in after life, what heirt<br>verdict should be, ,whcih he hoped would be that of<br>not guilty.<p>Mr Milne addressed the Jury in behalf of Mrs<br>M'Millian, and continued by saying that the in-<br>jury was intended for the cloak and not for the<br>person, and contended that he was entitled to a<br>verdict of not proven. The Lord Justice Clerk then<br>summed up the evidence, in his usual clear and<br>impartial manner, and pointed out to the Jury in<br>the most satisfactory way, that from all the circum-<br>stances, the female prisoner was clearly guilty.<br>The Jury having retired for ahout fifteen minutes,<br>returned a verdict unanimously finding the pannel<br>Hugh M'Millian not guilty, and unanimously find-<br>ing the prisoner Euphennia M'Millian guilty of the<br>second charge libelled in terms of the late statue,<br>but unanimously and earnestly recommending her<br>to the mercy of the court, the verdict being engross'd,<br>the Lord Justice Clerk thanked the Jury for their<br>attention, assured them their recommendation should<br>be duly forwarded to the proper quarter.<p>Lords Gillies and Pitmilly having delivered their<br>opinion, after which the Lord Justice Clerk address-<br>ed the prisoner in a most solemn and impressive<br>manner, not withstanding the recommendtaion with<br>which the jury had accompained their verdict,<br>nothing remained for the court but to pronounce<br>the last sentence of the law, even whatever might be the result<br>of the recommendation of the Jury, it would be well for her to<br>cultivate that contrition of heart and temper of mind which<br>might enable her to make her peace with God, for she might<br>lay her account with it, that even if her life was spared she would<br>be sent out of this country.<p>The sentance of the Court was then read, ordering her to be<br>executed at the common place of execution, on Wednesday the<br>23d day of January next, and the Husband Hugh M'Millian<br>was dissmissed from the bar. Dec. 1827.<p></p>
