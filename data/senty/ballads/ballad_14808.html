	<p> Uncle Tom's cabin.<p>I'm thinking of poor Uncle Tom,<br>So generous, kind, and brave;<br>The white man came when he was young.<br>And claim'd him as his slave.<br>Accursed he those sordid knaves<br>Across th' Atlantic sea.<br>Who traffic thus in human flesh,<br>In a land they boast as free !<p>Oh. poor Tom. poor Uncle Tom.<br>For thee kind pity's tear we crave ;<br>Oh, poor Tom. poor Uncle Tom,<br>The good old negro slave !<p>Awhile amid his lot so drear.<br>Some joy 'twas his to find :<br>His wife and little ones were dear,<br>His master, too. was kind.<br>His cabin it was clean and neat.<br>He'd all he wished to crave ;<br>And thus with a contented mind,<br>Forgot he was a slave.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  <p>But fortune on his master frown'd.<br>When years thus on had roll'd ;<br>And Uncle Tom, his faithful slave,<br>Was to another sold.<br>In vain lor mercy he did pray?<br>Oh, what a scene was there !<br>Tom from his wife and little ones,<br>The bondsman's chain to bear.<p>Alas ! who changed was poor Tom's fate,<br>How heavy were his cares ;<br>Doom'd to endure the galling lash.<br>In fain were all his tears.<br>How scant his meal, his dwelling  too,<br>A wretched, filthy shed ;<br>And after many hours of toil,<br>A heap of straw his bed.<p>And thus for many a weary year<br>Did Uncle Tom remain ;<br>When heaven, in mercy. to his home<br>Restored him once again.<br>The poor old negro's toil was o'er.<br>At length repose was nigh :<br>He saw his wise and little ones,<br>he saw them?but to die!<p>And shall the sordid, brutal wretch,<br>Of human souls the ban ?<br>Shall he who is but man himself,<br>Enslave his fellow man ?<br>Oh, are we not kith and kin?<br>Then all united be,<br>To give to each other a brother's hand,<br>And set the black man free.</p>
