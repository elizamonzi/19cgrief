	<h2>Transcription</h2>
	<p> An account of the Trial and Sentence of Margaret<br>Boag, yesterday before the High Court of Justici-<br>ary, charged with the atrocious murder of an old<br>woman, 75 years of age. at Dunning in Perth-<br>shire, with the account how the murder &c. was<br>discovered, which was committed six years ago.<br>Yesterday. (19th January 1824,) Margaret Boag was placed<br>at the bar of the High Court of Justiciary, charged with<br>murdering Elizabeth Low, at Dunning, in the connty of<br>Perth, in February 1818, and with stealing from the house<br>of the deceased various articles of napery, blankets, ticking,<br>&.c. and also with resetting the same. She pled Not Guilty.<p>Dr. Peter Martin, physician in Douning, was then called,<br>who depened. that he saw the body of Elizabeth Low about<br>eight o'clock i n the morning of the 18th February 1818; it<br>was lying on the bed. The skull was fractured by a blow on<br>the right side of the head. The wound was three inches in<br>length, and one inch and a quarter wide: the bones of the<br>fracture were driven in, and lay loose in the aperture, which<br>must have been mads by a bhuut instrnment, as the scalp was<br>not much injured, but witness did not look for any instru-<br>ment; there were only a few drops of blood in the wound.<br>but none externally. There were a number of bruises and<br>red marks on different parts of the body, and the face exhib-<br>ited an appearance as if she had struggled in agony while<br>being smothered. Witness being shown an axe, he said the<br>blow might. have been inflicted with it, if the head did not.<br>exceed an inch and a half in breadth. Something must have<br>interposed between the weapon and the head of Che deceased,<br>as the scalp would have  been more injured ; it was his decid-<br>ed opinion that the injury done to the brain was the cause of<br>death, and he still continued of that opinion. The other<br>marks, it is probable, were occasioned by holding the deceas-<br>ed.. He is also of opinion that the murder was committed<br>between Monday and the next morning. There was no<br>putrefaction, which did not take place til1 seventy-two hours<br>after, and he thinks the body must have been dead twenty-<br>four haurs before he .saw it. The prisoner at the bar claimed<br>a pair of shoes that were lying in the room&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;as her property,<br>saying what she had lent them to Elizabeth Low the other<br>night to go. up stairs in, her feet being wet, a. statement that<br>appeared Satisfactory to all present.<p>The  most material witness was Charlotte Duncan who lived<p>in the same house with Elizabeth, Low, who about 75 years<p>of age ; the house  consisted of 5 storeys.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; John Boag and his<p>daughter (the&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;prisoner,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;occupied 2 rooms on the ground<p>floor, Elizabeth Low  occupied a  room on the second, and<p>witness one  on the third.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On the morning of the 18th Feb.<p>1818 witness was comming up  stairs between 7 and 8 o'clock, she<p>observed the door of deceaseds  room a little' open ;  she went in<p>this window shutter  next  the bed was closed s. as nearly to dark:-<p>on the room, and she saw the body lying on the floor before <p>bed with'the clothes on, she called in the neighbours, the prison<p>er came in also.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On  looking for clothes to wrap the body in,<p>they found the chest, looked, but the prisoner remarked that<p>the deceased had always kept the key below her pillow, if<p>was found there, but  the&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;chest was empty.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Witness heard<p>steps during the night ,as if going up and down.<p>Janet Madie knew the deceased, she described the state of<br>the body, five or six plier of the Carpet which was rolled<br>tight round the head were cut through, a hatchet was lying<br>on the floor, which fitted the wound. Observing.a pair of<br>Margaret Boag's old slippers in the same room witness ex-<br>claimed, 'God bless me, how came your slippers here !<br>They would not have gone on the deceased's feet<p> Margaret Smith saw the son of the prisoner, wearing a<br>pinafore, which struck her so much that she exclaimed, Lord<br>he here, how has he gotten it, for it was Margaret Low's<br>gown. The witness made the gown.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<p>The prisoner had sold various articles to different witnesses<br>who were examined, and which  have been proved were.the<br>property of the deceased.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<p> The prisoners declarations were read in which she says<br>that she had bought the articles at sales, and part left her by<br>her mother. Alter the evidence was summed up, the jury<br>retired and returned with a verdict finding the murder not<br>proven, and the prisoner guilty of theft.<p>The Lord Justice Clerk in addressing the prisoner, said, a<br>move aggravated species of the crime of theft had never ap-<br>peared in that court.He sentenced her to transportation<br>for life&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
