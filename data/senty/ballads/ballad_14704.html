	<p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; EXECUTION<p><br>At Glasgow on Wednesday, the 29th October, 1823, of George Laid-<br>law, for Robbing a Jewellers Shop of Gold and Silver articles to the<br>amount of L.600 sterling, and Francis Cain, for Highway Robbery.<p>Glasgow, 29th October, 1823.<br>THIS day GEORGE LAIDLAW for Shop-<br>breaking and Theft, and  FRANCIS CAIN<br>for Highway Robbery, were Executed here,<br>pursuant to their sentence at the last Circuit<br>Court of Justiciary.<p>Laidlaw was convicted, along with George<br>Spittal, of breaking into the shop occupied by<br>Solomon & Hadkins, jewellers, Nelson Street,<br>Glasgow, on the 30th of March last, -and car-<br>rying off ten gold watches, about fifty silver<br>Watches, about 200 gold seals, 6  dozen gold<br>keys, about 5O gold rings, 40'pair of gold ear-<br>rings, one gold neck chain, and a great varie-<br>ty of other jewellery articles, to the value of<br>L.600 sterling.<p>It appears from the evidence en the trial<br>that Laidlaw was the planner or the robbery,<br>and to accomplish his object, got acquainted<br>with the shop-boy, and was frequently in the<br>shop; he at first by means of putty attempted<br>to take impressions of the keys; but, failing in<br>this, one morning as the boy was opening the<br>shop, borrowed the padlock from him, on<br>pretence that they had lost the key of the pad-<br>lock of their shop, and thought that his would<br>open it; he then went to an iron-monger's<br>shop and purchased a key to suit the padlock,<br>and then returned it to the boy.?Having suc-<br>ceeded thus far the unhappy Laidlaw and his<br>companion went to the shop one night at the<br>time above stated, and having tossed up a<br>halfpenny who should easer, the lot fell on<br>Spittal; who opened the door and went in, af-<br>ter locking the padlock to prevent suspicion,<br>while Laidlaw watched in the street. Having<br>collected as much as he could conveniently<br>carry, he came out, and they walked off with-<br>out locking the door, which the watchman on<br>the station soon after discovered standing o-<br>pen, and immediately gave notice to the Po-<br>lice Office.<p>The prisoners were unknown to the Police<br>as thieves, and it was only by a singular cir-<br>cumstance that they were discovered. The<br>prisoner Spittal, was offering for sale one of<br>the stolen watches to an acquaintance, who<br>wished to have a trial of it for a short time,<br>before he concluded the bargain which was a-<br>greed to by Spittal, and the person having ac-<br>cidentally, as he way passing, stepped into<br>Solomon & Hadkins, to inquire its value, they<br>immediately recognised it to be one of the<br>watches of which they hid been robbed, and<br>he told them from whom he got it; when Spit-<br>tal was immediately seized in his master's bake<br>house where his share of the booty was found.<br>Laidlaw was soon after apprehended, and his<br>part of the plunder was found concealed in a<br>cellar in Argyll Street. They were both found<p>guilty, but it having appeared that Laidlaw<br>was the most active in the planning of the rob-<br>bery, he was condemned to die; the  libel with<br>regard to his companion was restricted to an<br>arbitrary punishment, and he was sentenced<br>to transportation for life.<p>Laidlaw was a native of Glasgow, ana re-<br>ceived a suitable education; his father Being<br>in business for himself as a wright, "his son al-<br>so was learned the same occupation, and had<br>ha followed the example set before him by his<br>Parents a better fate might have availed him.<p>Cain was convicted, along with E. M'Caffer,<br>and P. M'Queen, of assaulting and robbing<br>Mr. James Maxwell, coppersmith, on the road<br>leading from shawfield Toll bar to Little Go-<br>vau, of a gold watch, with gold chain, & two<br>gold seals, a pause containing eight one pound<br>notes, some silver, and his bat, on the 9th of<br>July last. Mr. Maxwell was returing from<br>Rathergien about 12 o'clock at night,  where<br>he had been supping with  a friend) when he <br>was attacked by five follows, who knocked him<br>down with a stab taken from an  adjoining field,<br>and having robbed him of all in his possession<br>made  of ; they then proceeded down to Long<br>Govan, where they had some drink, and divi-<br>ded the  benty; and having crossed the river<br>they all returned by Partick and the Sauchie-<br>halt road to town, where they disposed of the<br>gold watch, no doubt to some infamous reset-<br>er of stolen property, for the paltry sum of<br>L.3; the whole of the fruits of their crime  be-<br>ing squandered in the haunts of dissipation &<br>vics. They were all found guilty, but the<br>label was restricted as to M Queen, and he was<br>sentenced to transportation for life ; the other<br>two were condemned to suffer death, but M'-<br>Caffer was recommended to mercy, and he<br>accordingly received a respite during His Ma-<br>jesty's pleasure on Friday last.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; .<p>Cain was born in Ireland, but has resided<br>with his father for a considerable time past in<br>the Gorbals. A younger brother has lately<br>been banished the county (or three year, for<br>theft, by a sentence of the Sheriff.<p>Laidlaw was attended by the Rev. Mr.<br>Snyth of St. George's  Church, and Cain by<br>the Priest of the Roman Catholic persuasion;<br>both of the unhappy culprits seemed perfect-<br>ly reconciled to a fate they could not avert.<br>About 3 o'clock they ascended the scaf-<br>fold; and after the appara us of death had<br>been adjusted, and a lew moments spent in<br>devotion, they were ushered into another, and<br>WE trust a better world.<p>Neither of the unfortunate youths had<br>reached their 20th year.<p>Printed by John Muir.</p>
