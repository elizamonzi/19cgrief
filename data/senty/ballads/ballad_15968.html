	<p> 1599 Newly Invented<br>Neat Irish Lies.<p>The particular account of old Mother Clifton's door, that was<br>locked by the roasted rib of a chew of tobacco, and burst open<br>by gale of wind from  sow gelder's horn, and blew the old<br>woman seven hundred and seventy-seven miles beyoad the moon.<br>I went in search of her, and ran five days and nights as fast as ,<br>I could, with my two shin bones in my pocket, and my head<br>under my arm, by order of Joe Buck, a pensioner, who lost his<br>middle eye at the battle of pea-soup,  when eating half boiled<br>stir-about.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I then got upon a buck flea's back, and rode over<br>the rocks of Skilligallee and mountains of Butter-milk, where I<br>met Jarvis the coachman, driving three dead horses under an<br>empty post chaise, laden with thirty-six  fustain cutters, eighteen<br>spinners, and six magpies, all drinking tea till as black as snow<br>in the face.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I then asked  him if he could tell me where one<br>Mother Clifton was.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He said he could not; but told me to go<br>to Jenny Broadside's house, at the hen's foot and cut's feathers,<br>in the parish of no place.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It was a little black white straight<br>crooked house, built all alone by itself, with five or six house<br>next door to it, and not a house within a thousand miles of the<br>place.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I thanked him; then set out running as fast as I could<br>sit by n ditch side, with my head under my arms, and my two<br>shin bones in my po cet, till I met with a poor man.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I asked<br>what ailed him; he said he had got the horn cholic in his big<br>toe, the head-ache in his belly, the tooth-ache behind his neck,<br>and the roger-gum-stnmble in his bread-bags, Dublin Custom-<br>house on his back, the Exchange in his pocket, and the New<br>Builey, where they dig for day-light, stuck in his near eye for<br>If waling cane,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I said " Lord help you, poor man ! and the<br>devil's cure to you ; why hadn't you better luck?"&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So I put<br>him in a coach, and drove him, coach and all, into a doctor's<br>shop, and ordered three dozea of pigs' eggs, three quarts of<br>pigeons' milk, three ounce of grass-hoppers' blood, two-quarts<br> of cels' basting, the head and pluck of a buck flea, the ribs of<br>a  roasted chew of tobacco, the lights and liver of a cobler's lap-<br>stone, boiled together separately in a leather wooden iron pot.<br>After ta ing this dose, he was brought to bed of two monkies,<br>a pair of blacs miths' bellows, a jack-ass,  hamper of greens,<br>elerenteen regiments of royal Irish dragoons, that fired a royal<br>salute of forty-one, in honour of King Daniel O'Connell.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After<br>this cure I went to Johnny Ironside's,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and the only people I<br>met were three dead dogs  playing at ball against a brick wall<br>made of paper.  I found Johnny in health, and asked him if<br>he had heard of Mother Clifton, that was drowned last night<br>about six weeks ago, in a shower of feathers.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He said " Yes,<br>I wrote to her to-morrow three weeks since,  when fast asleep<br>with my two eyes open in the middle of broad day-light and<br>as dark as pitch.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I thanked him for his intelligence, and was<br>going to bid him good, bye, but he told me I should not go til<br>I had dined.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And what should he put before ma but a dish of<br>stewed paving stones, well mixed with the lights and 1iver of a<br>cobler's lap-stone, and two quarts of a lamp-lighter's snuff box;<br>the next dish was full of wooden dumpling, stufted with eighteen<br>pounds of wax, three yards of tripe, two pounds of rosin, and<br>twelve fat bags.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After eating a hearty bally-full, I was  ready<br>to burst with hunger, and paid for my dinner with the third<br>part of a farthing.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was again going, but not permitted till I<br>saw some of him wonders;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He showed ma a small cabbage&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  <br>which covered ten acres of land, and under it ware ten regi-<br>ments of artillery and fourteen regiment of Irish bog-trotters<br>in a bloody engagement, firing lamp-lighters' wigs and pigs'<br>eggs at each other.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The new wonder was a big man in a scar-<br>let black coat, standing on a small heath table, preaching a<br>long sermon, but nothing spoke;  when a north country buck<br>flea bit him by the pole of the neck and made him roar murder.<br>He began to scratch himself, and catched the unfortunate devil<br>by the hair of his head,  then took him before a fidler's clerk<br>and swore his life against him, and afterwards dashed his brains<br>out against a sack of water.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He then showed me a little boy<br>thrashing tobacco into pease, when a pea went snack through<br>a wall eighteen feet thick,  killed a dead dog on the other side,<br>and drowned him in a dry ditch.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then I saw the London<br>privateer and the channel royal mail-coach in a desperate en-<br>gagement,  firing at each other boiled  oyster shells,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;stewed<br>pavement stones, and roasted wigs.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One of the stones hit old<br>Mother Clifton over the right eye, and delivered her of an old<br>woman of Radcliffe highway, who was her sister, and had nine<br>rows of wax teeth, and a three cocked hat made of the right<br>side of  crab's nostril.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I ,tock the old hag and  made a leap<br>with her from Liverpool to the north of Ireland&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;where I saw<br>a French frigate with Nelson's monument on her mast;-------<br>To conclude, this old woman stepped out of the ship into the<br>sea, then I made my escape, but the old woman was always<br>tipsy by the drinking of chandlers' tobacco, so she sank into<br>the bottom ; and if you will be at the trouble to go here, you<br>will find her making straw hats of deal boards.<p>Sanderson, printed,High street, Edenburgh.</p>
