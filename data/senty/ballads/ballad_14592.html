	<p> AWFUL CRUELTY!<p>Or, the Life of Miss AGNES RAE.<p>THE particulars of the Life and Death of Miss AGNES RAE, a gentleman's<br>daughter, belonging to near Dunfermline, who was betrayed and seduced by<br>a young gentleman ; she became pregnant to him ; his love turned to hatred<br>towards her, and ordered his servants to turn her out of doors ; she was then<br>reduced to poverty and obliged to beg alms from door to door, and on Mon-<br>day last was found in a most deplorable condition, lying dead in a byre be-<br>longing to Mr Blackburn, between Dunfermline and Kinross: with a copy<br>of a beautiful and interesting Letter, and a copy of Verses, which were found<br>in her pocket-book, written in her own hand-writing.<p>" ONCE the dearest but now the crueliest of men?if my exhausted spirit<br>would support my trembling hand, whilst I write a few lines to ease my broken<br>heart, it would be the last office I should require them to do, then may they<br>leave me; then may I find in the grave; a retreat from the scorn of men. How<br>is my gold become dim ; and my most fine gold become dross. I do not com-<br>mand you, by the awful name of virtue, to accuse you of ingratitude; ah ! no,<br>the scene is.entirely changed, you have robbed me of the brightest gem in the<br>female character, and now I come as a humble supplicant?is this possible-<br>am I awake, or did I dream ? ah! poor girl, think not what you were, but what<br>you are, how can I rest from calling to remembrance these days of innocence<br>and peace, when, with a serene countenance and sincere heart, I could look up<br>to heaven and beg the God of purity would be my protector; but ah ! how I<br>am changed, how is my virtue faded, how such guilt filled my soul, while blushes<br>cover my face; sad reflections on my present state makes me meditate on the<br>future, which opens so tremendous a scene to my view.<p>" Now whither shall I fly to find relief? If I fly to my friends, who were<br>once all my comfort, they, bathed in tears, cry out? 'You have brought our<br>gray hairs with sorrow to the grave' If to get one moment's ease I wander in-<br>to the fields, every flower I see, seems to say? 'We are pure.' Thus is nature<br>armed against me, and on whose account ? I seem to be forsaken by heaven and<br>earth on your account, who strove to gain my affections and became master of<br>them, and now you triumph over me, laugh at me for trusting your honour,<br>and putting confidence in your word ! ( ) hypocrisy, how couldst thou wear so<br>winning a form ? Generosity, where art thou fled? Honour, hast thou for-<br>saken the human race ? look on my distress ! O my God, despise me not! O<br>my friends, pray for me ! my distressed parents forgive me ! then may the cold<br>grave receive me in its peaceful recesses, where my shame may be buried in<br>eternal oblivion. May you, in the hour of death, find consolation from your<br>God and Judge, which you have denied to your&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  AGNES RAE."<p>You females all, both far and near,<br>Attend to what a friend doth say,<br>I'll make you weep my tale to hear,<br>For all my joy has fled away.<br>I was with education bless'd,<br>The best my friends could find,<br>They had me like a princess drest,<br>And nothing then disturb'd my mind<br>I was an only daughter dear,<br>My father's joy, my mother's pride,<br>And promised fair for many a year,<br>But oh alas ! my mother died.<br>When she upon her death-bed lay,<br>Her looks & words did pierce my heart,<br>Methinks she had much more to say,<br>Alas, her spirit did depart.<br>My father grieved his strength away,<br>Six months did close his mortal life.<br>This was to me a mournful day,<br>They laid him by his loving wife.<br>My uncles they my guardians were,<br>Also another of our friend ;<br>They kept me in great awe and fear,<br>Until I gain'd my wicked ends.<br>When sable night had clad us round,<br>And silent at the midnight hour,<br>A chance to escape then I found,<br>And gently clos'd the mansion door.<br>Where a young gentleman did wait,<br>My youthful heart he did trepan,<br>All at my father's garden gate,<br>He had his coach and waiting man.<br>He promised I his bride should be,<br> And nothing should control my will,<br>With every pleasure I could see,<br>I should enjoy me to my fill.<p>Allured by his beguiling tongue,<br>And arrayed in gay and rich attire,<br>Not thinking I was doing wrong,<br>Eloped with this gallant squire.<br>At length to him with child I prov'd,<p>He gave me language sharp and keen,<br>He hated me, who once he loved,<p>And never more by me was seen.<br>His servants turned me to the door,<p>Forlorn, disconsolate and distressed,<br>'Twas now I thought upon the poor,<p>When I had got no place of rest.<br>Along the purling stream I'd walk,<p>Thro' lonely groves and shady bowers,<br>No one I'd get with me to talk,<p>Or pass away the mourning hours.<br>[ hope, young maidens, you will hear,,<p>And give some thought to what I say,<br>To Pride Destruction's very near,<p>Let prudence guard your slip'ry way.<br>A flattering tongue always despise,<p>May virtue guide your steps aright,<br>Then to perfection may you rise,<p>In pleasure spend the day and night.<br>A blooming flower of twenty years,<p>Just in the prime of life should be;<br>My body to the grave they'll bear,<p>And not a tear be shed for me.<br>More I would say, but oh, the pain<p>Of death, I feel the mortal dart;<br>I hope in heaven my soul shall reign.<p>When death stops this beating heart.<br>She's clos'd her mortal scene below,<p>From grief and trouble she is free;<br>She's gone the road we all must go,<p>From time unto eternity.<p>Kirkwood, Printer.</p>
