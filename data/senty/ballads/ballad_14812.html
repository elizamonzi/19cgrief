	<p> THE<p>Hungry Army.<p><br>The wind in thundering gales did roar<br>As I left home in black October,<br>The hail and rain in torrents came,<br>And the world I thought was surely over.<br>The reason why, my " colleen dhas"<br>And I, fell out about my cousin Barney;<br>I bade farewell to the town of Kells,<br>And came to Dublin to join the army.<p>In Dublin city I soon arrived,<br>And crossed the Liffey?that darling river?<br>At the Castle-Yard a big " black guard"<br>Asked me to list,the bears to skiver.<br>I did agree, and they gave to me<br>A gun, but the weight of it soon did warm me;<br>So I hired myself by the powers of delph,<br>To go and smash Russia along with the army.<p>One morning the captain bawled out march.<br>In the barracks at Chatham we'll be quartered ;<br>By Jabers, you see, you'll not quarter me,<br>For I didn't join you to be slaughtered.<br>A sergeant, they said, I should be made,<br>But I knew the captain was tipping me blarney,<br>The stripes I got on an awkward spot,<br>While my back was aching I cursed the army.<p>News from abroad soon made us look sharp,<br>In a hurry we stuck our kits together;<br>To keep our hearts up we'd a stock of the sup,<br>And to keep up each head we'd a " stock of leather."<br>We marched to sea playing " Patrick's Day."<br>The cries of the colleens would most alarm ye ;<br>Some thought in their mind of the girls behind,<br>But I thought of the Bears were before our army.<p>In a ship as large as a town we sailed,<br>In every hole and corner stuffing us ;<br>To keep out the cold we.got down in the hold.<br>By the 'tarnal, it wouldn't hold half enough of us.<br>We were smothered to death for want breath,<br>And bursting with hunger which did not charm me,<br>We were ordered to land and make a brave stand?<br>Oh, they might easy say " stand" to a hungry army<p>On the field of battle I hadn't been long,<br>Till I was longing for it to be over ;<br>To let a ball pass I sat down on the grass,<br>But I didn't imagine myself in clover.<br>The ball, I can tell, was a great bombshell,<br>It attacked my rear, but didn't much harm me ;<br>When to the next charge we were ordered to march,<br>I had a " lame" excuse to " hault" from the army.<p>The 5th of November I long will remember<br>How the Bears at Inkerman did muster,<br>Before the daylight they gave us a fright,<br>Before we had rightly time to muster<br>On one of my props a ball came hop,<br>And there I lay till they came to bury me,<br>When to their surprise I opened my eyes,<br>Saying is this the usage you give in the army.<p>Then into the hospital I was sent<br>My wound to heal and my health recover;<br>To keep up my spirits I poured some down,<br>For nobody else would be at the bother.<br>Then Surgeon Turk began to his work,<br>And cut off my limb that did not charm me,<br>Now instead of my leg I have a wood peg,<br>So you see what I got along with the army.<p>132</p>
