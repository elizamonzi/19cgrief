	<p> UNTO THE RIGHT HONOURABLE<p>The Lords of Council and Session,<p>THE<p>PETITION<p>OF THE<p>CLERKS and APPRENTICES of Writers to the Signet,<br>and Writers in Edinburgh,<p>Humbly Sheweth ,<p>That your Petitioners, with much regret,<br>Take up your Lordships' time their ills to Hate ;<br>But conscious that your Lordships succour lend,<br>The sad to comfort, and the poor befriend,<br>We've dared with boldness to reveal our grief,<br>And from your Lordships' justice hope relief.<p>We've struggled long, chill penury to hide,<br>But now Necessity o'ercomes our pride;<br>Though modesty conceai'd our pressing need,<br>Our hollow stomachs would cry nut for bread ;<br>And sure this humble prayer's more grateful far<br>Than empty sounds of hunger at your bar.<p>Without poetic ornament or fiction,<br>We'll shortly state our case to your conviction :?<p>Your Lordships know, 'tis ours to copy pages,<br>For each of which poor threepence is our wages,<br>And that, in this unprofitable way<br>We're scarce employ'd a fourth part of the day ;<br>Most of our Masters thinking it quite fair,<br>To keep three extra Clerks to?live on air,<br>Though they themselves could finish every line,<br>They must have Clerks?For what ??To cut a shine<p>Our other time like churchmen we must spend,<br>So many messages our Masters send ;<br>In borrowing processes, and craving debtors ,<br>Taking down rolls, and passing signet letters ;<br>And trudging idly through the Outer.House,<br>We spend our time,?or rather time abuse.<p>How many a Writer's Clerk attends this Court,<br>Without one cause his spirits to support;<br>Yet see with how much cheerfulness he wal s,<br>And over knotty points majestic talks !<br>Then sudden stars, as if awoke from slumber,<br>Runs to the Macer, and cries- What's the number ,<br>Although with that he has no more to do,<br>Than if he were a miner in Peru.<p>Full many a tedious year has past away,<br>Since Writers' Clerks have got increase of pay ;<br>And e'en this ill we might with patience bear,<br>Had not each necessary grown BO dear.<br>A Writer's Clerk, full fifty years ago,<br>On thirty pounds a-year could be a beau :<br>But now, on that same sum We scarce can hide<br>Our naked skin, and meat and drink provide.<p>Tradesmen of all descriptions raise their wages,<br>Why, therefore, no increase for copying pages ?<br>If we're employ'd to copy any paper,<br>For instance, to a Hosier or a Draper,<br>Than what it was a century before ;<br>But, if we need a hat, a coat, or stocking,<br>(With great submission, is it not provoking ?)<br>Our Draper says, he cannot sell them under<br>Five times the price they cost in 1700.<p>We groan beneath a sad, yet just taxation,<br>From which there's little hope of extrication ;<br>But, as we're eager to support this squabble,<br>Against that vile licentious Gallic rabble,<br>We'll pay the taxes, while we have a groat,<br>Whether your Lordships grant our prayer or not.<p>But one late tax afflicts us to the heart,<br>Because we cannot with a Guinea part;<br>When powder'd we were decent looking fellows.<br>But now resemble Blacksmiths at their bellows;<br>We're pointed out, (our very souls it racks,)<br>As Writer's Clerks who can't afford the tax.<p>While other Tradesmen join in combinations,<br>To raise their wages, or desert their stations ;<br>To aid our plea, truth, justice, sense refined,<br>Are in your Lordships generous breasts combiued.<p>In order all these hardship to prevent,<br>May't therefore please your Lordsships to augment<br>The price of pages to a penny more<br>Than the low re to at which they were before;<br>And your Petitioners shall pray sincere,<br>That you may live and  judge ten thousand year.<p>Published by W. SMITH , 3 Bristo Port, Edina.</p>
