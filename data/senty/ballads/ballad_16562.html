	<p> Horrid Parricide.<p>An account  of the awful and inhuman Murder of<p>PETER&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;MOFFAT,<p>Carter in Kilsyth, by his own Son, on Tuesday the 2d  of April,<br>1822, who cruelly stabbed his father several times in the  belly,<br>so that he died soon after.<p>THE many wanton outrages and wicked murders with which the accounts from<br>the Sister Island has of late shocked the feelings, is truly distressing, but when<br>the barbarous and ignorant state of the inhabitants is taken into consideration, and<br>the present irritation from distress and supposed grievances, hardiy any other thing <br>could be expected; but is with pain that we have to record one of the most inhuman<br>murders, committed in the neighbourhood of this city, which ever stained the crimi-<br>nal records of our country.<p>On Tuesday the 2d April, a barbarous murder was committed at Kilsyth, 12 miles<br>from Glasgow, under the following circumstances :?Peter Moffat, carter, Kilsyth,<br>going home to his  house, after his day's labour, found his second son lying much.<br>intoxicated and was angry with him. Some dispute ensued, but the father aware of<br>the vindictive and ungovernable temper of his son when in that state, left him and<br>[  ] to a little distance from the house. The son soon after got up, and seiz-<br>ing a large knife, which he was accustomed in his drunken fits to wield, rushed out<br>and going straight forward to the place where his father stood, seized him by the<br>throat with one hand, and shocking to relate, made three deep stabs into his pa-<br>rent's bowels with the knife which he held in the other hand! The unfortunate fa-<br>ther, who had some distance to walk, reached his house with difficulty, literally car-<br>rying in his hands,  part of his bowels which had obtruced through his wounds; he<br>languissed in great pain for a short time, and then expired.<p>The cruel monster fled, but had the savage hardihood to return on Saturday last<br>go into the house and survey the dead body of his murdered father! The mur-<br>derer has, for the moment, escaped, but the, officers of justice are in search of him.<p>It is a lamentable fact. and one which affords another instance of the barbarous<br>and brutalizing effects of illicit distillation, that the unfortunate young man had,<br>for some time previous, been deeply engaged in the system of smuggling, of late<br>become so prevalent in this country. Every one must look with abhorrence on a<br>fact attended with such aggravated circumstances, as the crime which this man has<br>committed. The poor man was his father, so that he was, consistent with the dic-<br>tates of natural reason, bound to do all that lay in his power  to protect him, instead<br>of  which he inhumanely deprived him of  life. <p> Parricide is that of a son murdering his father; and the crime has always been con-<br>sidered in so odious a light, that it was long before some Heathen nations ever so<br>much as thought of a law to punish it; for this reason that they did not think any<br>person capable of committing it. The ancient Egyptians are the first mendioned<br>in history, who made a law to punish parricide; and when a son was found guilty of<br>murdering his father, he was tied up in a sack with a cock, an ape, and a serpent,<br>and thrown  into the Nile.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<p>John Muir, Printer. </p>
