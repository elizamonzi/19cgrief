	<p> HABBIE SIMPSON & HIS WIFE ;<p>Or,  A  New  Way  of Raising the  Wind.<p>This story with many others was first introduced and made popular by the late James Livingstone, the<br>best Comic Singer and Scotch Story-Teller that has yet appeared in West of Scotland ; and still remem-<br>bered by the name of " Tak' your auld cloak about ye."-Copies can always be had from James Kay,<br>Printer and Publisher, Glasgow.<p><br>I pit nae doot but ye've a' heard tell o' Habbie Simpson the piper o' Kilbarchan ; but I'm no thinking ye<br>ever heard the story that I'm gaun tae tell ye aboot him and his wife, Janet.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Weel, ye see, it sae happened<br>that Habbie, like mony mae now-a-days, was geyan fond o' a wee drap o' the blue, and, as the story gangs,<br>sae was his wife, so it geyan often happened that when Habbie yokit the fuddle, Janet she yokit it tae.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Noo,<br>it's an auld saying, and a gey true ane tae, that when a cannel is lichtit at baith ends it sune burns dune, and<br>it was sae verified in the present case, for Habbie waukened ae morning after a hard fuddle, and says to Janet<br>-Rise, woman, and see if ye can get me hauf a gill, for, oh! my heid is liken to split.-Hauf a gill ! (quo'<br>Janet,) whaur wad I get it when there's no a plack in the house, and as for takin't on, ye ken that's clean oot<br>o' the question, so ye maun jist lie still and thole the best way ye can.-Oh, Janet (cries Habbie again), you're<br>no amiss at schemin'-is there nae way ava ye can think on to raise the wind?-I'll tell ye what I'll do (quo'<br>Janet), I'll awa' to the Laird o' Johnstone, and I'll tell him that ye're dead, and as you are a great favourite o'<br>his, I'm sure I'll get something frae him to help to bury ye.-Od, but that will be grand (quo' Habbie).- Sae<br>up gets Janet and awa' to the laird's house, when, ringing the bell, the door was opened by the lady, who see-<br>ing Janet sae pitiful looking, she says-Keep us a' the day, is there onything wrang at hame that ye hae come<br>here sae early in the morning?- Wrang! (quo' Janet )-dichting her een with the tail o' her apron-a's wrang<br>thegither, my leddy; isna our Habbie deid.- Habbie deid! quo' the lady, in surprise.-A-weel-a-wat is he (quo<br>Janet), and a sair trial it is to me, my leddy, for there's no as muckle in the house this morning as would seed<br>a sparrow, and whaur to get onything I'm sure I dinna ken. Oh, dear! oh, dear! that ever I should come to<br>this o't.- Compose yoursel' (quo' the lady) and come yer wa's ben, and we'se see what can be done.-Sae in<br>gangs Janet wi' the lady, and get a basket wi' some biscuits and speerits, and ither articles needfu' for sic an<br>occasion, and thanking the lady for her kindness, comes awa' hame to Habbie fu' blithely, when doon they sat,<br>nor did they rise till they made an end o' the contents o' the basket. Noo, as the auld sang says, the mair ye<br>drink the drier ye turn, for they were nae sooner dune than Habbie says-Losh, Janet, that was real guid; can<br>ye no get some mair o't ?- Na, na! (quo' Janet,) I hae played my turn already. it's your turn noo.-Oh, very<br>weel (quo' Habbie), if it's my turn noo ye maun jist be dead next.-Ods, I hae nae objections (quo' she), sae<br>awa ye gang and let's see what ye can do.-Weel, awa' gangs Habbie, and, meeting wi' the laird just coming<br>hame frae a hunting party, he says-This is a fine day, laird.-A fine day, Habbie (quo' the laird), hoo's a'<br>wi' ye? Are ye no coming up to play us a spring on the pipes the nicht?-It wadna look very weel, laird,<br>for me to be playing on the pipes at your house and my ain wife lying a corpse at hame.-What, is Janet dead?<br>(quo' the laird.)-Atweel is she (quo' Habbie), and I'm sure it couldna ha'e happened at a waur time, for there's<br>neither meat nor siller in the house, and hoo to get her decently aneath the yird I'm sure I dinna ken -Dinna<br>vex yoursel' aboot that (quo' the laird, gi'en him some money); there's a trifle for you.-Habbie thanked the<br>laird for his kindness, bade him guid day, and cam' awa' hame geyan weel pleased wi' what he had gotten, and<br>sends Janet oot wi' tha bottle to get mair whisky to carry on the spree. In the meantime, hame gangs the<br>laird, whaur the first thing he heard was that Habbie Simpson was dead.-Na, na! (quo' he.) it's no Habbie;<br>it's only Janet.-It's Habbie (quo' the lady); wasna Janet here this morning hersel' and tell't me? and didna<br>she get awa' some speerits and biscuits, as she said there was naething in the house?-And didna I meet Habbie<br>just as I was coming hame, when he tell't me that Janet was dead. But I See hoo it is-they are at their auld<br>tricks again. But come, we'll awa' to Habbie s and see what they're aboot.-In the mean time, Habbie and<br>Janet are fuddlin' awa' in fine style, and lauchin' heartily at the way ta'en to raise the wind, when Janet cries-<br>Guid preserve us, Habbie, what's to be dune noo? I declare if that's no the laird and the lady, and they're<br>coming straught here.-I dinna ken (quo' Habbie,) what to do, unless were baith dead.- Sae in the bed they<br>gaed, and they were nae sooner doon than the laird and lady cam' in, and-seeing Habbie and Janet in the Bed,<br>he says-Waes me! isna that an afuw' sicht to see?  the man and the wife baith dead! But I'd gi'e five shil-<br>lings this moment to ken which o' the twa de'et  first.--The words were nae sooner oot o' his mouth than up<br>jumps Habbie, crying-It was me, laird; noo gi'e me the five shillings-It is needless to add that the laird<br>gied Habbie the money, and mony a hearty laugh he had when he thought on the way Habbie and his wife<br>had ta'en to RAISE THE WIND.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<p>PRICE ONE PENNY.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <p></p>
