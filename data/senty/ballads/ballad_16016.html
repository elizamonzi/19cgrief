	<p> 'An Account of the Trial of ROBERT FERGUSON,  before the Circuit Court of Jus-<p>ticiary at Inverness, which was opened on the 15th of September,  1812, for the wilful<p>Murder of CAPTAIN CHARLES MONRO, of  his Majesty's 42d Regiment, and for<p>which crime he is to be executed at Inverness, on Friday the 30th of October next, and his<p>Body given for Dissection.<p>THE Circuit Court of Justiciary com-<br>menced sitting at Inverness on Tuesday<br>the  15th  of September,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1812, before the<br>Right Hon. the Lord Justice Clerk, and<br>Lord Hermand.<p>Robert Ferguson, indicted for the wilful<br>murder of Captain Charles Monro,some time<br>of his Majesty's 42d Regiment of Foot, was<br>brought to the bar. On the diet being<br>called, the prisoner's Counsel craved an ad-<br>journment to the following day, in order that<br>certain witnesses to be adduced in exculpa-<br>tion, and not yet arrived, might have time<br>to come up. The Court delayed the trial,<br>in order that the prisoner might lose no ad-<br>vantage which the testimony of these wit-<br>nesses could afford him.<p>On Wednesday, Robert Ferguson was a-<br>gain brought to the bar, and the following<br>written defence lodged for him:?"Denies<br>the murder, but acknowledges the slaughter,<br>by a knife held up in self-defence." The libel<br>having been found relevant, and remitted<br>to an Affize, the following witnesses were ad-<br>duced in support of the prosecution:?<p>George M'Donald, Surgeon in Cromarty,<br>was called upon to see the deceased on the 2d<br>of June last. The Doctor found him in bed,<br>in the house of George Thomson, a cart-<br>wright in Chapeltown. On uncovering his<br>body, the witness found a wound penetrat-<br>ing the left side of the cavity of the belly,<br>about three inches in length, and a great<br>quantity of the small intestines protruded?<br>the outer coat of part of the intestines being<br>partially cut. On examining the wound,<br>the witness immediately considered it to be<br>mortal, not only from the quantity of in-<br>testines which had been protruded, but from<br>the dark and inflamed colour of the whole.<br>The witness lost no time in returning the in-<br>testines, but, owing to the narrowness of the<br>incision in the muscular substance, in pro-<br>portion to the quantity of intestines protrud-<br>ed, he was under the necessity of enlarging<br>the wound before they could possibly be re<br>turned. The deceased gave the witness no<br>other account of his misfortune than that the<br>wound had been inflicted by a knife; that all<br>the provocation he gave was taking the man<br>by the collar of the coat, and attempting to<br>turn him out of Thomson's shop?adding,<br>that " he wished he had fallen in the field of<br>battle," Captain Monro died about eight<br>o'clock the following evening, and witness<br>is of opinion that his death was occasioned<br>by inflammation and consequent mortifica-<br>tion; nor does he believe that although sur-<p><br>gical assistance had been instantly afforded to<br>the deceased, his-life could have been saved,<br>owing to the extent of membrane which had<br>been wounded and exposed.<p>George Home, apprentice to Geo. Thom-<br>son, black-smith at Chapeltown, was on the<br>2d of June last in his master's shop. The<br>deceased came into the smithy about five in<br>the evening; Pannel entered soon after; the<br>witness heard Ferguson and the deceased<br>swearing at each other; heard the Pannel call<br>Captain Monro a d-?d b??r, on which<br>the Captain pushed him out of the smithy.<br>Pannel soon after returned, and came for-<br>ward as if to attack the Captain, who de-<br>fended himself with a switch he held in his<br>hand. Pannel followed him close, and struck<br>him with a knife, on which the deceased im-<br>mediately called out, " I'm gone, take hold<br>of the man." Pannel went and stood with-<br>out the door, and Capt. Monro followed,<br>hold ing in his intestines with his hands, and<br>again called out, " Why do you not seize<br>the murderer?" Pannel was thrown down,<br>and the knife taken from him, and, on being<br>held fast, he offered to go willingly with wit-<br>ness to a neighbouring Justice. The deceas-<br>ed was in the mean time taken into Thomson's<br>house by Mrs. Thomson, and put to bed,?-<br>On the way to the Justice of Peace, in cus-<br>tody of this witness and his fellow workman,<br>he suddenly stopped and refused to go further<br>without a warrant, threatening to use any man<br>who should offer to seize or detain him as he<br>had done the deceased.<p>Alexander Munro, corroborated the tes-<br>timony of George Home; said the Pannel<br>stabbed the Captain twice.<p>Mrs. Thomson was called out of her house<br>when the accident happened. Saw Captain<br>Monro standing near the door of the smithy,<br>holding his hands to the wound; she helped<br>him into the house and put him to bed. He<br>said, some time after, " I did not think the<br>man would have done this to me; God knows<br>I would not have done it to him; we had but<br>a few words, and I only put my hand to the<br>back of his neck to throw him out for giving<br>me insolent language."<p>John Home, in exculpation, deponed that<br>Capt. Monro " was a warm hearted man,<br>but rather rash when any thing vexed him."<p>The evidence being summed up, Lord<br>Hermand charged the Jury, who returned<br>a verdict, finding the Pannel Guilty. He was<br>sentenced to be hanged at Inverness, on Fri-<br>day 3oth October next, and his body given<br>for dissection.<p>T. Duncan, Printer,  Saltmarket, Glasgow,</p>
