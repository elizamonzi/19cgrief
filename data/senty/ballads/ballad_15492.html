	<p> TRIAL,<p>and sentence<p>An account of the trial and Sen-<br> tence of Andrew Ewart, for  the<br>murder of Henry Pennycook,<br>in the Church yard of Libber-<br>ton on-the 4th December last,<br>and who is to be executed at<br>Edinburgh on the 19thday of<br>March next.<p>This day Monday 11th February, came on the<br>Trial before the High Court of Justiciary of Andrew<br>Ewart, for firing a guu loaded with swan shot, on the<br>morning of Wednesday the 5th December last, within<br>the Church-yard of Libberton, and wounding Henry<br>Penaycuick in the right arm, whereby he lingered<br>till the 8th of the same month, when he died.<p>The-substance of the evidence was that the &,.<br>ceased and the prisoner were, along with others in<br>the watch-house of the church, yard of Libberton, on,<br>Tuesday evening the 4th day of December last.<p>They were so earnestly occupied in conversation of<br>what took in the church yard on the Monday pre<br>ceding, when the watchman of that night approhand-<br>ed a body-snatcher in the act of opening the grave,<br>that they did not observe the deceased, leave them-<br>Shortly afterwards he was followed by another, who.<br>observing a dusky figure standing at the end of the<br>watchhouse, hastily returned, and gave an alarm that<br>another resurrection man was in the yard. Firmly<br>impressed with this idea, he snatched up a loaded gun,<br>ran to the door, and instantly levelled it at the sup-<br>posed intruder, who pacifically said, ' Sorely you'l<br>not shoot me ? but the words had scarcely escaped<br>his lips ere he received the contents in his arm. It<br>was then too late, discovered that the unfortunate<br>man was Pennycuick; and that a friends life had<br>been sacrificed instead of that of a sacrilegious depre-<br>dator....Pennycuick died on the Saturday following,<p>Tee public Broseestor addressed the Jury at great<br>length, which was ably answered by the Prisoners<br>council.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  The&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;jury .'then .retired&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and  in a few<br>minutes raturned  verdict of Guilty, but strongly re-<br>commended the prisoner to mercy.<p>The Lord Justice clerk after addressing the prison-<br>er sentenced him to be executed at Edinburgh, on<br>Wednesday, 19th of March next.<br>The prisoner is a decent looking man, appeared to<br>be very very, much affected when the awful sentence<br>of death  prohounced against him.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
