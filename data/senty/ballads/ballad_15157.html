	<h2>Transcription</h2>
	<p> Copy of a very interesting ADDRESS to the prisoners in Jedburgh,<br>Greenlaw, and Berwick Jails, written, and delivered to a Friend a<br>few hours before his Death, by ROBERT SCOTT, who was Exe-<br>cuted on Wednesday 29t& October, 1823, on the Road between Earl-<br>ston and Greenlaw, for .the Murder of Two Men, and his body<br>given for Dissection.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  <p>My Dear Fellow Prisoners,<p>ALTHOUGH I am unacquainted with you, yet such is my love<br>to your precious and immortal souls, and my desire to do<br>good since I came to some knowledge of -the truth, that my heart.<br>beams with the strongest love and desire for the salvation of your<br>immortal souls. You would hear of my very awful situation on<br>the-brink of eternity and condemned to an ignominous death. You<br>would, no doubt, think my case very distressing ; yes it is, it is very<br>distressing, but let me tell you, there is one thing of more import- <br>ance to you and me than temporal  death, and its ignominy, viz.<br>that you and I have a great, just, and holy God to meet with soon,<br>before his awful bar, where our judges and we shall have an impar-<br>tial sentence.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Is it not awful to think, that the Lord will in nowise<br>clear the guilty who. have no faith in the atonement.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My dear<br>friends, you may think you are not so great sinners as I am, and<br>that therefore you do not deserve damnation as I do,because your<br>sins do not bring you to the gallows ! now, God forbid that I should<br>think your sins so aggravated as mine, but you will surely allow,<br>that, as every sin deserves hell, so you are guilty in the sight of<br>God ; and had it not been for his  tender mercies, he would have<br>cut you off from the earth long before this time, and sunk you into<br>everlasting damnation; but O, what thanks to our God, that has<br>no pleasure in the death of the wicked, but would rather he would<br>turn from his evil ways and live.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;O the love that God has to poor<br>sinners !&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; God so loved the world that he gave his only begotten<br>Son, that whosoever believeth on him should not perish, but have<br>everlasting life !&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My dear friends, herein is the love of God to us,<br>not that we loved God, but that he loved us, and sent his Son to be<br>a propitiation for our sins, and to die an ignominious death, that we<br>through his death might live.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now, for the love of your own souls, <br>fly from the power of sin to that refuge which is set before you in<br>the Gospel.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; O take warning by me, and pray to God night and <br>day for his grace and love; and if you are diligent in duty, and do<br>as you ought, rest assured you will never come into my condem-<br>nation.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I would also exhort yon to abstain from drinking and bad<br>company, sins that lead to every other, vice, such as whoring, steal-<br>ing and swearing.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It was  drink that  brought me into this dark<br>and gloomy prison ; it was drink that chained me to the ground.<br>with these iron fetters.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Drunkenness is the cause of much sorrow.<br>of mind, and if mercy prevents not will lead to eternal perdition.<br>This is often the consequence of drink, but mercy has been offered<br>to me for the last time, and I have accepted of it.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; O what an in-<br>stance of grace in me, of sinners the chief, the vilest on earth.<br>Drunlcenness hath  bound, me with these iron fetters, but I hope<br>diey are the best friends that ever went on me, for I think and do<br>believe they have been the means,of my everlasting salvation.<p>There is another thing I would advise you, to remember the<br>blessed Sabbath-day, and do not break it, but spend it in praying<br>arid glorifying God, for remember, that breaking the Sabbath is a<br>most heinous sin in the sight of God, and he will certainly punish<br>those with heavy vengeance than will dare to transgress this holy<br>commandment ; but I trust, you will take a consideration of your-<br>selves, and look upon, this and every sin with perfect abhorrence,<br>and come to a  reconciled God in Christ, and implore him of his<br>in finite mercy, to grant unto you, an assured faith in his dear Son,<br>Jesus  Christ, to believe that he is able and  willing to save you<br>through his finished work alone.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you do this, you may rest as-<br>s/?/red, that the Lord will in nowise cast you out ; for hear the words<br>of Jehovah to sinners, even the chief, " that there.is more  joy in<br>heaven over one sinner that .repenteth, than over ninety and nine<br>just persons that think they need no repentance.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Come unto me<br>all ye that labour and are heavy laden, and I will .give you rest."<br>NOw, my dear friends, look to the mercy of God even your God,<br>and believe in this, try, through grace, never to offend him wilfully<br>more; look to Jesus as just and good, and consider what he suffer-<br>ed for you.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; O for God's sake, if you have any regard for your<br>precious souls, believe on the Lord Jesus  Christ, and  you shall be<br>saved,<p>I must now take a long and lasting farewell. I recommend you<br>to God, and the word of his grace, who is able to build you up,<br>and give you an inheritance among them that are sanctified through<br>faith in his name. May wo all meet in that happy world, where all<br>who believes and love shall meet again, and part no more. I remain<br>your poor unfortunate friend, and sincere soul's well wisher. R.
