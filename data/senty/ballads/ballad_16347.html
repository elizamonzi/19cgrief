(quoth Bessy, grumbling,)<br>" Kend I this James.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A chiel came rumbling,<br>But how was I assur'd, when dark,<br>That he had been nae thievish spark,<br>Or some rude wencher, gotten a dose;<br>That a weak wife could ill oppose."<br>"But what came of him [  ] speak nae langer,"<br>Cries Halbert in a Highland anger.<br>"I sent him to the barn," quoth she:<br>" Gae quickly bring him in," quoth he.<br>James was brought in?the wife was bawked?<br>The priest stood close?the miller cracked?<br>Syne spcer'd his sulky gloomy spouse,<br>What supper she had in the house;<br>That might be suitable to gi'e<br>Ane of their lodger's quality.<br>Quoth she, " Ye may well ken, goodman,<br>Your feast comes frae the parritch pan :<br>The stov'd or roasted we afford,<br>Are aft great strangers on our board."<br>"Parritch," quoth Hab, "ye senseless tawpie !<br>Think ye this youth's a gilly-gawpy;<br>Or that his gentle stamock's master<br>To worry up a pint o' plaister,<br>Like our mill knaves that lift the laiding,<br>Wha's kytes can rax out like raw plaiding,<br>Swith, roast a hen, or fry some chickens,<br>And send for ale frae Maggie Picken's.<br>" Aye, aye," quoth she, " ye may well ken,<br>'Tis ill brought but that's no there ben;<br>Whan but last owk nae farder gane,<br>The laird got a' to pay his kain."<br>Then James wha had as good a guess<br>Of what was in the house, as Bess,<br>With pawkey smile this plea to end,<br>To please himsel' and ease his friend,<br>First open'd with a sleo oration<br>His wond'rous skill in conjuration.<br>Said he, " By this fell art I'm able<br>To whop off any great man's table<br>Whate'er I like to mak' a meal o',<br>Either in part, or yet the hale o',<br>And, if ye please,  I'll show my art,?<br>Cries Halbert,?"Faith, with a' my heart !"?<br>Bess fain'd hersel',?cry'd, " Lord bo here !"<br>And ne'er hand fell a swoon wi' fear.<br>James lough,?and bade her nathing dread,<br>Syne to conjuring went with speed ;<br>And first he drew a circle round,<br>Then utter'd many a magic sound<br>Of words, part Latin, Greek and Dutch,<br>Enough to fright a very witch:<br>That done, James says, "Now, now, 'tis come,<br>And in the boal behind the lum:<br>Now set the board; goodwife gae ben,<br>Bring frae yon boal a roasted hen."<br>She wadna gang, but Haby ventur'd:<br>And soon as he the ambrie enter'd,<br>It smell'd sap well, short time he sought it,<br>But, wond'ring, 'tween his hands he brought it.<br>He viewed it round, and thrice he smell'd it,<br>Syne with a gentle touch he felt it.<br>Thus ilka sense he did conveen,<br>Lest glamour had beguil'd his e'en:<br>They all in a united body,<br>Declar'd it a fine fat how towdy.<p>"Nae mair about it," quoth the miller,<br>"The hen looks well, and we'll fa' till her."<br>" Sae be't," says James; and in a doup,<br>They snapt her up baith stoup and roup.<br>" Neist, oh !" cries Halbert, "could your skill<br>But help us to a waught of ale,<br>I'd be oblig'd t' ye a' my life,<br>And offer tae the deil my wife,<br>To see if he'll descreeter mak' her,<br>But, oh, I'm fleed he winna tak' her."<br>Said James, " Ye offer very fair,<br>The bargain's hadden, sae nae mair."<br>Then thrice James shook a willow wand,<br>With kittle words thrice gave command;<br>That done, with looks baith learn'd and grave,<br>Said, " Now ye'll get what ye wad have;<br>Twa bottles of as nappy liquor<br>As ever ream'd in horn or bicquor,<br>Ahint the ark that hauds your meal,<br>Ye'll find twa standing corket weel."<br>James said, syne fast the miller flew;<br>And frae their nest the bottles drew;<br>Then first the scholar's health he toasted;<br>Wha's magic gart him feed on roasted;<br>His faither's neist,?syne a' the rest<br>Of his good friends that wish'd him best,<br>Greatly o'er langsome at this time,<br>In a short tale to put in rhyme.<br>Thus, while the miller and the youth,<br>Were blythly slock'ning of their drowth;<br>Bess fretting, scarcely held frae greeting; <br>The priest, enctos'd, stood vex'd and sweating,<br>" O wow !" said Hab, " If ane might speer,<br>Dear Master James, wha brought our cheer<br>Sic laits appear tae us sae awfu',<br>We hardly think your learning lawfu'."<br>"To bring your doubts to a conclusion,"<br>Says James, "Ken I'm a Rosicrucian,<br>Ane of the set that never carries<br>On traffic with black deils or fairies;<br>There's mony a sp'rit that's no a deil,<br>That constantly around us wheel.<br>There was a sage called Albumazor,<br>Wha's wit was gleg as ony razor :<br>Frae this great man we learned the skill,<br>To bring these gentry to our will;<br>And they appear, when we've a mind,<br>In ony shape of human kind:<br>Now, if you'll drap your foolish fear;<br>I'll gar my Pacelot appear."<br>Hab fidged and leugh, his elbuck clew,<br>Baith feared and fond a sp'rit to view:<br>At last his courage wan the day,<br>He to the scholar's will give way.<br>Bessy by this began to smell<br>A rat, but kept her mind to'r sel';<br>She prayed like howdy in her drink,<br>But meantime tipt young James a wink.<br>James frae his eye an answer sent,<br>Which made the wife right well content;<br>Then turned to Hab, and thus advised,<br>" Whate'er you see, be nought surprised,<br>And for your sonl, move not your tongue;<br>But ready stane with a great rung;<br>Syne as the spirit goes marching out,<br>Be sure to lend him a sound rout:<br>I bidna this by way of mocking,<br>For nought delights him mair than knocking."<br>Hab got a kent?stood by the hallan,<br>And straight the wild mischievous callan<br>Cries, "Radamanthus husky mingo,<br>Monk Horner, hipock, jinko, jingo,<br>Appear in likeness of a priest,<br>No like a deil in shape Of beast,<br>With gaping chafts to fleg us a':<br>Walk forth, the door stands to the wa'."<br>Then frae the hole whaur ho was pent,<br>The priest approached, right well content ;<br>With silent pace strade o'er the floor,<br>Till he was drawing near the door;<br>Then to escape the cudgel, ran,<br>But was not missed by the goodman.<br>Wha lent him on the neek a loundor,<br>That gart him o'er the threshold Hounder.<br>Darkness soon hid him from their sight :<br>Ben flew the miller in a fright;<br>" I trow," quoth he, " I laid well on;<br>But wow, he's like our ain Mesa John I"<p>Saturday, July 15, 1871.</p>
