	<h2>Transcription</h2>
	<p> To the EDITOR of the SUNDAY REVIEW.<p>SIR,<p>AS I understand you are a Caledonian, it is not unlikely that an<br>account of our Burgh Politics may afford you some gratification. Our<br>Election came on yesterday; Laird D?d, the Banker, is re-elected Lord<br>Mayor, with general approbation.?-A. respectable South Bridge Merchant<br>was proposed for First Bailie ; but as he declined the honour, the choice<br>fell on the late " Lord D?g?l," the Ironmonger. The Nephew of a cer-<br>tain Reverend Gentleman, whose name stands very high in the republic of<br>letters, wished the Treasurership, but that was previously secured by one<br>more in favour. J?y W?r, made a bold push for D?n of G?d ; but<br>he was out-tongued by C?r's sweet-meat oratory. The Old Convener,<br>and Young Rapid, are made Trades Counsellors. The Deacons were pretty<br>cordially elected, except last year's marrow-bone and cleaver Chief, who<br>had shamefully demeaned himself, by subscribing a petition to the H?e of<br>C------s, which he knew was not consistent with truth, and which, he was<br>well aware, was directly contrary to the wish of his Constituents. He was<br>therefore grazed, (i. e. he was dismissed from office at the end of his first<br>year's service,) and a new one chosen in his stead. But when he found this<br>was to be the case, he ran off with the Clerk of the Incorporation's Return <br>to the Council of the Leet of Six Members, from which the new Deacon<br>was to be chosen, with the pitiful view of preventing a new Election al-<br>together for twelve months; the silly fool not dreaming that another Re-<br>turn could always be had from their Minute-book. But while he was in<br>concealment, his mother was in dreadful terror for the safety of her son ;<br>and therefore, after due consultation with the Commissary and Rob, the<br>following Handbill was stuck on every lamp-post, and even on the gates of<br>the Tripe-market:<p>" LOST OR STRAYED??A gawkey-looking Lad, wi' fair hair, a sharp<br>" neb, and shrivelled chin:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;had on a dark coat, wi' clear buttons, and<br>" walks like a water-wagtail:?talks muckle about being a D------n, but<br>" says he is ganging to the grazing;?has a paper in his pouch, whilk<br>" he ca's a Leet;?frequently speaks about he and his mither's man dining<br>" wi' ane Sir William, and says he got a promise of being made L------d<br>" H------?k's,Jackall.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Whaever will secure the Callan, sae as he may<br>" be restored for the comfort of friends, will be rewarded to their hearts&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>" satisfaction."<p>This had the desired effect; the Lad was found, and he and his friends<br>now " glory " in suffering for what they style true patriotism.<p>I am, Sir, &c.<p>TOM PEEP.<p>Ancient Burgh, E******h, 7th October 1807.</p>
