	<p>  A Full and Particular Account of the Trial and Sen-<br>tence of Charles MacLaren, Thomas Grierson, and<br>James M'Ewan, accused of Housebreaking and<br>Theft, they having, on the 8th, or the morning of the<br>9th September, entered into the House of Thomas<br>Riddle, Esq. W.S. Gray Street, Newington, and<br>stealing there from a variety of Silver Plate, a Gold<br>Snuff-Box, a Pair of Pistols, &c. who are to be<br>Executed at Edinburgh, on Wednesday the I2th<br>February, 1823.<p>AT Edinburgh, on Saturday the llth January, came on before<br>the High Court of Justiciary, the Trial of CHARLES<br>MACLAREN, THOMAS GRIERSON, and JAMES M'EWAN,<br>.accused of theft and housebreaking, having, on the evening of Sun-<br>day the 8th, or the morning of Monday the 9th September, entered<br>the house of Thomas Riddel, Esq. W.S. situated in Gray Street,<br>Newington, and stole therefrom 18 silver forks, 31 silver table<br>spoons, 16 desert do, a soup ladle, 13 tea spoons, a sugar bason, a<br>number of plated candlesticks, a gold snuff box, a pair of pistols,<br>besides a variety of other articles.?-Further, with entering, on the<br>11th or 12th of the same month, the house of Colonel Monro, of<br>the Honourable Eaat India Company's service, situated in George's<br>square, and stealing a silver tea pot, sugar tongs, &c. besides seve<br>ral pieces of French lace, three silk gowns, and a silk scarf. The<br>pannels were indicted as being habit and repute thieves, MacLaren<br>having been eight, Grierson six times, and M'Ewan twice, in Bride-<br>well. To which the pannels pled Not Guilty.<p>After the fullest and clearest evidence, on the part of the prose-<br>cution, the Jury, after a few minutes consultation, unanimously<br>found the pannels Guilty of the first charge in the indictment, and<br>the second Not Proven ; and unanimously recommended James <p>M,Ewan to mercy, on account of his youth.<p>Lords&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Meadowbank and Succoth  having  separately  delivered<br>their opinions, the  Lord Justice-Clerk stated, that it was now his<br>painful duty to announce to  the  prisoners  the punishment which<br>the law had affixed to the crime of which they had been convicted<br>by a respectable and intelligent Jury of their country.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is at all<br>times to be deplored that persons of such tender years should be-<br>come  liable to  such a  punishment; but, though young in years,<br>they had been going on  for a  long  period in a series of crimes,<br>Much us crime had increased among society, it had increased in a<br>ten-fold measure  among youth, which would lead one to suppose<br>that there were persons in this city, who made it a business to<br>train up boys in the most easy and expeditious manner of commit-<br>ting crimes.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Not having profited by the wholesome discipline of<br>bridewell, the prisoners had persisted in a course of crimes which<br>had brought them to this consummation.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It remained only for the<br>Court to deliver the dreadful sentence of the law, any it was most<br>earnestly to be hoped that their awful situation would serve as an<br>example to others, which would be the  desired effect.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It must<br>never be again held that youth  can be a protection to crime and it<br>will convince your guilty associates of the hazard which they run<br>if' they persist  in the course in which you have been engaged; an<br>occupation which sooner or latter  must  place  them in a similar<br>situation.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  He trusted, however, that their example would have the<br>desired effect upon those who were following such courses. It was<br>impossible to conceive that such young  persons could have acted<br>.otherwise than as the instruments of their seniors ; but  he would<br>advise all such to retrace their steps, and make a full disclosure of<br>those sinks of infamy and vice, who prompted them on to their<br>rain, and to the certain forfeiture of their lives, to the offended laws<br>of their country.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; His Lordship concluded a pathetic address, of<br>which we have given  but  a faint outline, by recommending  the<br>pannels to prepare to  appear  before&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the judgment-seat of their<br>Maker?to pray, and to read the scriptures; and if they could not<br>roap themselves, they would get others that would do it for them ;<br>not to waste their time in idle expectations of mercy, for there was<br>nothing in their case which could support such an idea : That they<br>must entertain no other hopes of pardon but those which were to<br>he derived through the salvation of jesus Christ&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He then passed<br>sentence of death, ordaining the pannels to be Executed at Edin-<br>burgh, on Wednesday, the 12th day of February next.<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  PRICE ONE PENNY.</p>
