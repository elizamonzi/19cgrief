	<p> COPY OF A VERY<p>CURIOUS LETTER <p>From the Bell of the High Kirk of Paisley, to its Friend the Cross<br>Steeple of Glasgow, giving an account of  her being struck with<br>the Dumb Palsy, and the curious remedy which the Bell-doctors<br>took to restore her to health and sound.<p>Paisley,  12th October, 1821.<p>Maister Prenter,<p>WHA wad e're thocht to hae seen me writing<br>in the public prents, I'm sure that the like o't<br>seldom happens. But come and  I'll tell ye<br>wha first put the thing into my noddle. It was<br>just the last Saturday night that as I was luck-<br>en o'er the public  prents, what do ye think I<br>saw? I'm sure ye'll no guess, for I was muckle<br>surprised to see't mysel-It was a letter frae<br> my frien in Glasgow, " The Cross Steeple,"<br>maken' an unco complaint o' ingratitude an'<br>neglect trae them it had served sae lang.<p>I hae seen the day, Mr. Prenter, that I wad<br>nae hae needit to trouble yaw to tell my story;<br>na, na, for heth its weel aneugh kent that whan<br>I  wus in my health I  could speak braw an' loud,<br>and could gar folk hear me far an' near; but<br>as I am sair alter'd, I think I mun be excus'd<br>for following the plan of my frien, and I dare<br>say ye'll think sae too when ye hear how ill I've<br>been used.<p>I'm an auld servant o' the public, and ne'er<br>kent what it was to spare my strength in wurk-<br>ing my wark; na, na, that was ne'er a trick o'<br>mine, for by night or by day I was aye ettling<br>to please folk, and tho' I say it mysell, that<br>may be shauld na doe't, I hae been aye true to<br>my trust, and until I took my present trouble,<br>it was ayont the power o' the Diel himsell to<br>find fault with me, and it's weel kent that he's<br>nae frien to our kind o' folk. Mony a winter's<br>blast I hae seen, and some taks't upon them to<br>say that I may see mony mae if I'm wee doc-<br>tor'd; but they'll no gar me believe that, for my<br>trouble is owr serious, and I'm sair, sair  touted.<br>They dinna ken my distress, or they wud na<br>speak that way. My head is a' wrang, and my<br>tongue has worn a hole thro' my cheek, an' its<br>a great stress for me to speak ayont my breath,<br>an' O but I'm sair tired o' my birth; no to say<br>that I'm unwillen to serve my auld maister, but<br>really I canna work my wark toony gude pur-<br>pose; an' Oh I canna thole to get sae mony re-<br>flections, when I weel ken it's no my faut.<p>They brought a doctor to see me, but it wasna<br>a doctor o' physic, fur ye ken sic folks can do<br>nae gude to a patient wha has neither blude<br>nor  anes. But it was a doctor o' bells, an'<br>when he saw my sad condition, he thocht it ad-<br>viseable as weel as pruden to ca' in fur advice<br>anither emanent docter  o' soun's; an' after the<br>twa a had cansultet th' gither they at last pro-<br>nounced my trouble to be " the Dum' Palsy,"<br>Dum' enough faith, thinks I, an' as other doc-<br>ters seldom meets an' consults, without doing<br>something mair to their patient, sae an' opera-<br>tion was purposed to me, an' 'twel awat muckle<br>I suffered during their experiments.They<br>drew a saw draught frae my lip to the hole i'<br>my cheek; but this did nae gude, an' indeed I<br>never expeckit it, fur I cou'd na see how it was<br>possible, fur it the soun' whisled thro' my cheek;<br>before I didna ken, how making the crack big-<br>ger wi' a saw wad gart keep in the won better.<br>Now that am as ill as ever, an' i' my present<br>state a disgrace to the place I till, what for no<br>let me retire frae my birth in peace, as they<br>doe a' other worn-out public servants. I'm suir<br>I'll no seek ony pension na, na, I'm nane o' the<br>greedy set; but it's only for the honor o' the<br>place that I fill, that gars me seek my discharge<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>Now, Maister Prenter, as I ken that a heap<br>o' folk read your papers, if you prent my state-<br>ment, it might come un'er their observation,<br>an' wha kens but they may tak pity and grant<br>my request. In which case you wud ne'er be<br>forgotten by<p>Maister Prenter,<p>Your obedient Servant.<p>THE PAISLEY HIGH KIRK<br>STEEPLE BELL.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<p>Printed by John Muir, Glasgow.</p>
