	<p> CATS' EYES.<p>PRICE  ONE PENNY.<p>Copies of this humourous song can only be had in the Poet's Box<p>Air-The Night before Larry was Stretch'd.<p>Come listen to me while I sing,<br>Of misery I've had my share;<br>Till fortune took me under her wing,<br>And my troubles all vanished like air.<br>In the days of my youth I did wed,<br>And our time passed with joy and delight,<br>Till my wife round the house should be led,<br>She got so shocking bad with her sight.<p>You may guess how my mind was at ease;<br>I became a poor object of pity;<br>As my presence at home wouldn't please,<br>I'd go rambling about through the city.<br>One day a large placard I spied,<br>And in letters black, blue, and white,<br>It said " Doctor Snigum's arrived,<br>And will cure any one with bad sight."<p>I was home in the wink of an eye,<br>The good news to my wife I unfolded,<br>With joy she was ready to die,-<br>She was sorry that ever she scolded.<br>In my hurry, instead of her cloak,<br>The old blanket I wrapped round her tight,<br>Bore her off on my back-what a joke!<br>While the people all laughed at the sight.<p>This house was 19, College-green,<br>We arrived, and I knocked at the door,<br>And said, when the doctor I'd seen,<br>" This old Rat-trap I want you to cure."<br>He brought us up stairs in a trice,<br>And pulled out his utensils so bright,<br>On a saucer he shoved out her eyes,<br>And set-to to polish her sight.<p>He made them shine like a new pin,<br>On a table he left them behind her;<br>But the Doctor's big cat just came in,<br>Sure the Doctor nor I didn't mind her.<br>The cat's feed being generally there,<br>She ate up the two eyes at a bite;<br>We leapt after her down every stair,<br>But OLD SCRATCH took her out of sight.<p>We searched every corner and hole,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>From the garret all down to the cellar,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  <br>There we BONED her on top of the coal,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  <br>And the doctor caught hold of her smeller.<br>The cat's eyes he brought up to my wife,<br>And popped them into her head tight,<br>She declared in the course of her life<br>She had never such beautiful sight.<p>Coming home we both got a small drop.<br>To congratulate her and myself,<br>Then we stopped at a large china-shop<br>To look at some new fashioned delph-<br>A buck tabby was inside the sash,<br>When my wife raised a hump to show fight,<br>She MOLL-ROWED and went through with a smash,<br>For you know she had got the cat's sight.<p>A-97, had her caught,<br>But he went by his worship's advice-<br>To the mad-house he made her be brought,<br>She amused herself there catching mice.<br>One day in her window she sat,<br>About four or five stories in height,<br>She leaped down at a flaming big rat,<br>And was killed-so I grinned at the sight;<p>Saturday Morning, August 28, 1858.</p>
