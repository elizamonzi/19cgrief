	<p> A Full and Particular Account of the Trial and Sentence of ROBERT TENNANT,<br>who is to be Executed at Stirling, on Wednesday morning, the 2d of October<br>next, and his body buried within the prcincts of the Jail there, for the Horrid<br>Murder of William Peddie, labourer, by felling him on the head with a Ham-<br>mer, on the evening of the 3d of August, 1833, while breaking stones on the<br>road, in the parish of Falkirk.<p>At Stirling, on Thursday the 12th September, 1833, came on, before the Circuit<br>Court of Justiciary, the trial of Robert Tennant, for the murder of William<br>Peddie, labourer at Airth, on the 3d of August last, a little to the north of Bean-<br>cross, in the parish of Falkirk. The indictment stated, that the prisoner did,<br>wickedly and feloniously, attack and assault the deceased with a stone hammer,<br>or some other instrument, and inflict on his head two severe blows, whereby he<br>was mortally wounded, and immediately expired, and was thus murdered by<br>the prisoner; to which he pled Not Guilty.<p>Henry Reid and Mr Brock passed northwards from Beancross on 3d August,<br>about 5 P.M.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Saw a man lying on the ground, and two wounds on the back<br>part of his head.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The ground was damp with blood?the man was quite dead,<br>but not stiff&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Reid gave notice to Mr Borthwick, junior.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; D. Sharp knows<br>pannel?saw him at Kerse Toll on 3d August, about 3 P.M.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Went into the<br>toll with him.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They left the house together, and pannel went into witness's<br>cart.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They went south to Beancross, and pannel came out of the cart at a path<br>before they arrived at that place, and stood, seemingly speaking to Mr Gird-<br>wood, who was going up that path.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Saw the prisoner that day before about<br>12, at the place where he was breaking stones, and his hammer was lying be-<br>side the heap of stones.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; T. Girdwood saw prisoner the day that Peddie's body<br>was found, about 4 o'clock, on the road a little below Beancross.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He asked if<br>witness had seen deceased, who said he had, having passed him when going<br>north, and between 200 and 300 yards from where he met the prisoner.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Wit-<br>ness asked if the pannel himself had not seen him, and he said he had come up<br>behind him all the way from the toll.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Left pannel there, and returned in about<br>ten minutes, and found pannel still standing there.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Witness then went south<br>towards Beancross, and again met Peddie coming north.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Saw nothing more of<br>them that night.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Saw the place where the body was afterwards found, and it<br>was the very spot where witness had left the pannel.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; John Henry knows the<br>pannel?saw him on the road between Kerse toll and Beancross, on 3d August<br>between 3 and 4 o'clock, leaning to a hedge, and his hammers before him. Saw<br>the deceased after he left pannel, coming north towards where he had left pan-<br>nel.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Saw the deceased's body that night, near the place where he had left pan-<br>del.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; John Fleming saw pannel, on 3d August, sitting at the hedge at the side<br>of the road that passes Beancross, and he gave witness a cry.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Did not see de-<br>ceased, though he might have passed him.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; John Coubrough heard of Peddie's<br>body being found, and went to the spot about 6, before it was removed.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Wit-<br>ness then made a search in a field of beans adjoining, and about 60 paces to-<br>wards the north, found the pannel lying among the beans, apparently asleep,<br>as witness spoke repeatedly before he answered.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He denied having seen de-<br>ceased that day.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; George Shaw was collecting dung on the road, and saw pan-<br>nel, who spoke to witness.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On his return from the north, saw pannel and de-<br>ceased talking together, and heard the name Borthwick mentioned?this  was<br>between 4 and 5 P.M.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Went to his house, and again returned to  take home<br>the dung.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He then saw Peddie lying lifeless at the very spot where he had seen<br>him and pannel.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He was not absent more than ten minutes.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Saw a wound<br>about the head.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Did not see pannel, but he almost immediately came out of a<br>field of beans, and asked witness to conceal what he had seen.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Witness said he<br>would not, though he were his father.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Prisoner said if witness concealed it,<br>and he denied it, they could not prove it against him.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Borthwick superin-<br>tends the road between Kerse toll and Beancross.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Saw Peddie at work on 3d<br>August last, and instructed him to dismiss pannel from the work, because that,<br>although the deceased had before prevailed on witness to keep him on the road.<br>it was evident that his drinking and irregularity rendered him unfit to be longer<br>employed&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  The deceased was foreman on the road, and about 70 years of age.<p>Dr Graham here read a report describing the wounds, which he and Dr Main<br>had drawn up at the time.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Two hammers were discovered when the body was<br>found, one of which witness now identified in court, and the grey hair still adher-<br>ing to it.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dr Main concurred in this evidence.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The prisoners declarations<br>were then read.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He stated he was about 24 years of age, and admitted he was<br>at Grangemouth fair. and that after getting some drink at the toll, he had gone<br>into the field of beans and fallen asleep, out of which he had been roused by<br>John Coubrough.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Denied that he had, on the day in question, spoken to the<br>deceased, or been in any way connected with the murder; and also denied that<br>he asked George Shaw to conceal any thing regarding him.<p>Two witnesses were then examined in exculpation, who merely stated, they<br>never saw any thing quarrelsome in his conduct, and considered him an inoffen-<br>sive man. This closed the evidence, when Mr Shaw Stewart addressed the Jury<br>in support of the prosecution, and was followed by Mr Crawford for the pan-<br>nel, who made an eloquent and ably argumentative defence. Lord Gillies sum-<br>med up the. evidence, and the Jury then retired. In half an hour, they returned<br>into Court with their verdict, unanimously finding the prisoner Guilty, but re-<br>commending him to mercy, on account of his previous good character, and that<br>up to the time of meeting, when the murder was committed, it did not appear that he had formed<br>any premeditated plan of commiting the same. After which, Lord Gillies proceeded to pronounce<br>sentence, and having concluded an earnest and feeling address to the prisoner, in the course of which<br>his Lordship stated, that he saw no reasonable hope of the recommendation of the Jury effecting any<br>alteration of the judgment to be awarded. He sentenced " the unhappy man to be carried back to<br>the tolbooth of Stirling, and to be there maintained on bread and water, till Wednesday the 2d day<br>of October next, and on that day, between the hours of 8 and 10 in the morning, to be taken to the<br>place of execution at Stirling, and there be hanged on a gibbet till he be dead, and that his body be<br>afterwards interred within the precincts of Stirling jail." The prisoner exhibited little or no emotion<br>when judgment was pronounced, but displayed that appearance of sullenness which he had manifest-[?].<p>Menzies, Printer, Edinburgh.<p></p>
