	<p> The HISTORY and Comical LIFE of<p>Jean Murphy.<p>Shewing the enterprising scenes she came through when commanding a<br>party of Rebels in Ireland: how she travelled Scotland in man's apparel,<br>as a packman, and smuggling at the same time, then turned lamp-lighter<br>in this City, when she proposed marriage with. Water Jenny, her landlady<br>on purpose to get some money she had, the wedding day was set, Sca-<br>vengers and lamplighters with their wives and children were invited to<br>the dinner ; after getting tipsey, a bloody battle ensued,when heads, legs,<br>and arms were broken, wives and beams squalling, and in the midst of<br>the uproar she made her escape, leaving Jenny a widow of her money.<p>THE  heroine of the following<br>memoirs, was born a few miles<br>from  Limerick,  in&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ireland.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  Her<br>parents were in middling good cir-<br>cumstances, which enabled them to<br>bestow  ample&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;education&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;on&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;her.<br>When she left school she could not<br>settle herself to domestic employ-<br>ment;  being robust and rambling,<br>she took&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;great pleasure  in doing<br>outwork along with her father and<br>brothers, and very often would go<br>along  with the horse and cart in<br>the mornings to Limerick  market<br>to dispose of the  produce of their<br>small farm, on&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;which&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;occasions,<br>when the mornings were cold ', she<br>would  have her brother's hat and<br>top-coat, which made her look more<br>like a boy than a  girl.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She con-<br>tinued in this manner till  the  last<br>rebellion, in  which&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;we learn  she<br>took an active part, dressing herself<br>in man's attire, and  changing her<br>name  to  Patrick  Murphy,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;joined<br>the rebels, and after a great many<br>skirmishes  and&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; defeats&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;with&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the<br>royalists,  she  was&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;taken&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;prisoner<br>and confined for about three weeks,<br>but she soon contrived to make her<br>escape,  at a time  when  they were<br>marching&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the  prisoners from&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;one<br>place to another.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She then joined<br>a second time time rebels,  and  took<br>the command of a party, and soon<br>after received wounds in two places,<br>one on  the&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;thigh  with&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a  musket<br>bull, and the oilier with&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a  bayonet<br>on the left cheek, which left a deep<br>scar, and with her tall stature, being<br>about 5 feet 9 inches high gave her<br>a masculine  appearance,  so  that it<br>was impossible&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;for any one  to dis--<br>cover  her&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;sex.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;her&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;affairs<br>were entirely ruined in Ireland',  she<br>for&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; self-preservation,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;shipped&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; for<br>Scotland, and  settled  in Glasgow,<br>when; she met with some acquaint-<br>ances who had  left Ireland for the<br>same  reason, but  not one of them<br>Understood . that she was a woman,<br>having still on man's apparel.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  She<br>travelled Scotland with a pack-box,<br>dealling in jewellery, hard-ware, &c.<br>and at times engaged  with smug-<br>gling parties both in the North and<br>West Highlands of Scotland ; after<br>continuing for a number of years<br>in this manner,  she settled in the<br>metropolis, and got the birth of a<br>lamplighter,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;which&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;situation&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;she<br>behaved  herself very expertly and<br>honestly, (having never defrauded<br>her employers of one gill of oil.)<p>The house in which she lodged<br>helonged  to an  old  woman called<br>Water  Jenny,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;well&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;known in the<br>City, who by her frugality and in-<br>dustry had saved  about. one hund-<br>red pounds, which&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Murphy ascer-<br>taining,  immediately&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;laid schemes<br>to get the sum in&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;her own posses-<br>sion ; she could line none to answer<br>so well as to pretend love to the<br>old&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;wife,  which she did so effec-<br>tually, that in a few days she con-<br>sented to the match.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The bills for<br>the money was delivered to Mur-<br>phy, to purchase cloathes for them,<br>and  pay all necessary  expences;<br>the Priest was sent for, and guests<br>invited&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;wedding&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;dinner,<br>consisting of lamplighters, scavan-<br>gers, &c. with some of  Jenny's<br>relations.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The day arrived and<br>the Company  all  met, Jannet as<br>blythe and cheery as she had been<br>a Lass of sixteen,  though she was<br>upwards of sixty-eight,  with  only<br>one tooth, and one of her legs as<br>thick as her waist below the hump<br>on her back, while the other was<br>as small as her wrist; the priest pro-<br>posed&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to commence the ceremony,<br>but Murphy opposed it till  after<br>dinner.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After the priest said grace<br>they&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; attacked&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; dishes&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;with<br>tork  and&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;knife,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and soon&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;cleared<br>the table;  then Whisky came ga.<br>lore, which soon makes an Irishman<br>hamorsome and merry,  songs and<br>jokes make the time pass on quick,<br>and Murphy retired, without being<br>noticed,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;preparing&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; le&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;make  her<br>escape along with Blarney M'Shane,<br>to whom she discovered her sex and<br>intentions.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  The peace and  happi-<br>ness&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; company&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;was&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; soon<br>broken,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;by a hint  Dennis  gave  to<br>M'Ginnes&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; scavenger,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;about<br>living with his supposed wife without<br>the sanction at the church, M'Gin-<br>nes instead of  making  an  answer,<br>lent him a stroke on the head  with<br>his shilelall, or rather a broom shift,<br>then&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;general&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;battle&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;began,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;in<br>which&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;wives  and  children&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;took a<br>share, the mutches were soon below<br>the table, hair torn out, heads, arms<br>and legs broken, and in the midst<br>of the affray Murphy made her e-<br>lopement along  with Blarney, to<br>enjoy  the&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;produce  of Jenny's in-<br>dustry.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Murphy in a  few  days<br>sent a letter to Jenny, couched in<br>a  most affectionate&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;manner, dis-<br>covering her sex, which nigh hand<br>put Jenny out of her senses.<p>PRICE ONE PENNY.</p>
