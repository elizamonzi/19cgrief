	<h2>Transcription</h2>
	<p> A particular account&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; of the <p>EXECUTION <p>Of these three unfortunate young men<br>Michael Macintyre. Wm.Paterson-<br>and Wardrope Dyer, who were exe-<br>cuted at Glasgow, yesterday, 24th<br>Oct. with their dying behaviour.<p>THIS day the  last  mandate of the  law was put in execution<br>against the above three unfortunate young men, in front od<br>the prison, in the presence of a vast concourse of spectators.<p>Macintyre and Paterson were condemned for entering the<br>house of I. Niven, and stealing various articles of wearing apparel.<br>Macintyre was not above 29 years  of age, and was born in Ireland.<br>His parents endeavoured to gain a livlihood by hawking earthen<br>ware through this country, while the son was left to shift for him-<br>self, and might have been often seen going about the streets sel-<br>ling gingerbread, he unhappily became acquainted with idle and<br>dissolute company, along with whom he committed several petty<br>depredations, and was well known to the keeper of Bridewell.<p>Some years go he enlisted into the 26th regiment of foot, but being<br>several times guilty of plundering his comrades, des, he was severely<br>punished and dismissed from the regiment He again returned to<br>Glasgow, and commenced his old career of vice, till put a stop to<br>by unerring justice. Paterson was born in Manchester, but of Scot<br>tish parents, and came to Glasgow when a child. His father died<br>some years ago in the East Indses. His parents, from imprudence<br>and poverty, having neglected his early habit. he was soon led a-<br>stray, and alas, fell a prey to every species of vice with which every<br>large city abounds.<p>Dyer was convicted of breaking into the house of the late Mr<br>M'Culloch in Russel Street, and stealing a quantity of silver plate.<br>There is every reaion to suppose that the crime for which this un-<br>fortunate youth suffered was not his first offence, for on scarch-<br>ing his lodgings. there were found concealed about a foot deep in<br>tae floor, nearly 60 keys of various descriptious, some of them the<br>police officers declared they never saw the like before. This un-<br>happy young man was born in the Drygate' in the north quarter<br>of the city, of very reputable parents; (his mother died some<br>years ago, but his father remains to bewail his fate,) He received<br>a suitable education, ana at the proper time he was put to the<br>weaving. He however got acquainted with women of very ques-<br>tionable characters, took up with gamblers, boxers, & bullies, who<br>were always the first to point out the opject of plunder. & ever<br>ready to partake of the booty, but to wary too share in the danger;<br>& to these baneful suggestions he lent a too ready ear, which, as<br>he himself declared, brought him to an ignominious end, at the<br>early age of 22 years. It is said he has pointed out a notorious<br>haunt of these depredators in the Gallowgate, over which the po-<br>lice will no doubt keep a watchful eye.<p>On Sunday last the Rev. Dr Ranken, who also attended them to the<br>place of Execution .preached a very appropriate sermon to these unfor-<br>tunate men, and the rest of the prisoners, from Psalm i. 6, at which<br>Dyer seemed much affected but the other two prisoners behaved in the<br>most hardened manner, and addressing the other prisoners that if ever<br>they Were brought to the bar of justice, to be sure to plead guilty if they<br>wished to escape being hanged.<p> This prisoners were brought into the Court Hall about two o'clock,<br>and having finished their religious devotions, their religious devotions.<br>they expressed their acknowledgements to Mr Macgregor, the jailor for<br>his kind attention to them, and about three o'clock they ascended the<br>scaffold, when the awful preparations having been completed the dron  fell<br>and the world closed on these unfortunates for ever.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<p></p>
