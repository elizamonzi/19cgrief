	<h2>Transcription</h2>
	<p> An account of the wonderful discovery<br>of the murderer of William Begbie,<br>Porter to the British Linen Company's<br>Bank, who was murdered in November,<br>18O6, in the Bank Close, Nether Bow,<br>and Robbed of nearly £.5,0OO, with<br>the whole particulars how the Mur-<br>derer was discovered.<p>THE murder of WILLIAM BEGBJE porter to the British Linen<br> Combany, who was stabbed in the entry leading to the Bank, which<br>was situated in the Nether Bow ; and robbed of a bag containing bank<br>notes amounting to nearly L.5000 in, the month of November 1806. is<br>the most mysterious affair that has happened in the present generations<br>and from a number of circumstances just published in the life of Moffat,<br>alias Mackcoull, there, is every reason to believe that he was tho murder-<br>er; there is a copy of a memorandum relating to the murder, which was<br>taken by a gentleman on Mackcoull's trial in May 1820, from which we<p>state the following.------In the autumn of 1805, Mackcoull made his daily<p>appearance in the Ship Tavern in Leith, and gave himself out for a British<br>Merchant fled from Hamburgh when the French took possession of that<br>place; he spoke German a little, but upon questioning it was easily found<br>he was no merchant. Mackcoull frequented the ship tavern for about 12<br>months, and immediately dissappeared after the murder was committed.<p>A sailor, who is now a respectable schoolmaster in Leith, had come<br>home from Lisbon, and having some small present which he brought to<br>his mother, he left Leith with it on the night of the murder; and when<br>on his road, he saw a tall man with a yellow bag under his arm going up<br>the Walk, who he supposed was a smuggler, but who was Begbie; and a<br>man dogging after him, who he supposed was an Excise officer; for fear<br>of his own little present which was seizable, he put it into his breast and<br>keeped behind them watching the officer's motions; but when he came to<br>the head of the North Bridge he missed them, and supposing they had<br>gone up the High Street he pursued his way down the street; but just as<br>he came opposite the bank close he saw the officer coming running out of<br>it with something below his coat, and being afraid of losing his own he<br>made haste to his mother's and delivered the present, and then went di-<br>rect to Leith, from whence he sailed in a day or two, and was taken by<br>the French, and kept in prison until after the peace.<p>The dress and description this sailor give to the supposed officer exact-<br>ly corresponded with that of Mackcoull, and Mackcoull always left Leith<br>abont dusk to go to his lodgings at the foot of New Street ; and the mur-<br>derer ran down Leith Wynd, whence he could easily make to New Street<br>by bye entries.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<p>Mackcoull did not make his appearance till 12 months afterwards, and<br>his constant walk was down by Bellevue, where the large notes were found<br>about the same period. Mackcoull immediately changed, his lodgings to<br>a quite different airt. and resided in a remote house beside Boston the<br>gardener, to avoid suspicion ; having some time before lived in Rose Street.<p>The same gentleman called at the prison after Mackcoull's con-<br>demnation, and taking advantage of his situation, (for he was then<br>doubtful of receiving a respite), conversed with him for some time<br>in his cell, in presence of the Governor. He told Captain Sibbald<br>he intended to ask the prisoner a single question relative to the<br>murder of Begbie, but would first humour him with a few jokes,<br>so as to throw him of his guard, and prevent him from thinking<br>that he called on him for any particular purpose ; but desired Cap-<br>tain Sibbald to watch the features of the prisoner when he<br>put his hand to his chin, for he would then put the question<br>be meant. After talking for some time on different topics, he put<br>this very simple question to the prisoner..." By the way, Mackcoull,<br>if I am correct, you resided at the foot of New Street, Canongate,<br>in November, 1806, did you not? He stared...he rolled his eyes ;<br>and, as if falling into a convulsion, threw himself back on his bed!<br>In this position he contnued for a few moments, when as if recol-<p>lecting himself, he.started up, exclaiming wildly,  No, by------! I<p>was then in the East Indies-in the West Indies...What do you<br>mean ? ' I mean no harm Mackcoull, I merely asked the question<br>for my own curiosity; for I think when you left these lodgings you<br>went to Dublin, is it not so ? ' Yes, yes, I went to Dublin' he re-<br>plied", .'and I wish I had remained there still?I won L. 10,000<br>there at the tables, and never knew what it was to want cash.' <p>He now seemed to rave, and lose all temper, and his visitor<br>bade him good night, and left him.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  </p>
