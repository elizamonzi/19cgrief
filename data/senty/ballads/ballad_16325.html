	<p> SHIEL'S<p>RIGHTS&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;OF&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;MAN.<p>I speak in candour, one night in slumber,<br>My mind did wander near to Athlone,<br>The centre station of this Irish nation,<br>Where a congregation unto me was shown.<br>Beyond my counting, upon a mountain.<br>Near to a fountain that clearly ran ;<br>I seem to tremble, I'll not dissemble,<br>As they assembled for the Rights of Man.<p>All clad in green there I thought I seen<br>A virtuous queen, that was grave and old,<br>Saying, children dear, now do not fear,<br>But come and hear what I will unfold.<br>This fertile country near seven centuries,<br>Since Strongbow's entry upon our land,<br>Has been kept under by foes unnumbered,<br>And always plundered of the Rights of Man.<p>My cause you chided, you so derided,<br>When divided, alas ! you know,<br>All in disorder round Erin's border,<br>Strife, grief, and murder, hath laid you low.<br>Let each communion detest disunion,<br>In love and union join hand in hand,<br>And believe in Granua, that proud Britannia<br>No more shall rob you of the Rights of Man.<p>Through the azure sky, I then did spy<br>A man to fly and for to descend,<br>And straightway come down upon the ground,<br>Where Erin round her had her bosom friends,<br>His dazzling mitre and cross was brighter<br>Than stars by night, or the mid-day sun;<br>In accents rare, I do declare,<br>He prayed success to the Rights of Man.<p>When prayer was erded, he condescended<br>His hand to lend it in freedom's cause,<br>He says I'll lead you, and always aid you,<br>And still persuade you to Christian laws,<br>When in affliction, or sad restriction,<br>My benediction with uplifted hand,<br>I here explain it, you shall obtain it,<br>And surely gain it with tho Rights of Man.<p>For their inspection and clear direction,<br>And grand discretion, the three leaved plant,<br>He elevated and consecrated,<br>And these repeated; do not recant?<br>But still look to it, and still review it,<br>Let none subdue it?it is three in one,<br>To prove its unity in that community,<br>That holds lenity the Rights of Man.<p>He straightway blessed, and then caressed,<br>But still impressed them to persevere,<br>When a rustling wind that seemd quite unkind,<br>Wafted this liquid through the ambient air;<br>Then Granua fluttered, and these words uttered,<br>I'll break your fetters before it's long,<br>Then away ho flew and bade them adieu,<br>Saying, I'll be true to the Rights of Man.<p>When the population or congregation,<br>In exultation agreed to part,<br>Shook hands like brothers, and kissed each other,<br>While friendship smothered each Irish heart,<br>They seperated, all animated,<br>All elevated at what went on,<br>As day was breaking, and poor Shiel's awaking,<br>Crying, " Still be true to the Rights of Man."<p>PRICE ONE PENNY.</p>
