	<p> SHOCKING AND DISGRACEFUL<p>MURDER<p>Full, true and particular Account of the horrid<br>and cruel Murder of James Gough of the<br>Roval Artillery, who was barbarously stoned<br>to death by three men, on Sunday night;<br>Together with the apprehension of the<br>Murderers.<p>Taken from this Day's Observer, Aug. 14.<p>A dreadful Murder was committed near Ballin-<br>tyne, on Sunday night, the perpetrators of which<br>we expect will be shortly brought to answer for<br>the crime at the bar of justice.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The facts&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;as<br>they were stated to us; are?some countrymen<br>had been drinking at the canteen up to 8 o'clock, <br>at  which  time they were ordered to retire to<br>their&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;homes,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but  one refused,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;asserting&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;that<br> he  would  not be  put out  by any soldier."<br>This led to some altercation, and when  the or-<br>derly non-commissioned officer told them he was<br>directed to  make them quit, they  still persisted<br>in refusing, which induced him to take the most<br>refractory fellow by the  collar to  send him out<br>of the room&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  This man struck the orderly, and<br>a scuffle ensued, when some of the guard, com-<br>posed  of Lancers, came up and cleared the can-<br>teen.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When the countrymen were quitting the<br>barrack gate, some of them were heard to  say,<br>that they would revenge themselves on the first;<br>soldier  they  would  meet.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Shortly&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;after&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;this,<br>and before 9 o'clock, three artillery soldiers were<br>returning to barracks from a walk, when two of<br>them&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;being&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;about thirty  yards of advance&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of<br>their comrade, the country fellows saluted them<br>with " Goodnight, boys," which the soldiers re-<br>turned ;  but they  had only proceeded a short<br>distance,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;when they heard a cry of " dont hurt<br>or&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;kill&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;man," they,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;accordingly, returned<br>back to the assistance of their comrade,  but too<br>late, for the brutal ruffians actually stoned him?<br>and he survived only a few hours.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Major Gal-<br>wey, Inspector of the Cons'ublary, and Magis-<br>trate of the couny, has apprehended several per-<br>sons who are strongly&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;suspected  being of the<br>party, and through his exertions sanguine hopes are enter-<br>tained, that  in it few days all the Murderers will be in cus-<br>tody.<p>An Inquest will be held on the body to-day, when much<br>important information is expected to be elicited. The crime<br>has caused great generation in that neighbourhood, and filled <br>the minds of all with horror and disgust.<p>The deceased  was a young man named Gough, and bore<br>an excellent character in the company.<p>FORBKS & CO.
