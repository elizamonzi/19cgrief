That, so soon as I did<br>so, I immediately made my escape, as I judged with<br>myself that the wound I had given him was mortal,<br>and that he would not recover; and went to the<br>Highlands, and strolled about from place to place,<br>my conscienee having always checked me, I could<br>not get rest day nor night, when I considered with<br>myself the cruel and inhuman murder that I had com-<br>mitted.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  <p>I at last went to London, and betook myself to<br>such employment as I could get; and thereafter be-<br>came a watchman, but was always apprehensive, and<br>afraid of being apprehended; the more particularly<br>so, as I saw some persons in London, who knew me<br>in Glasgow, and was conscious to themselves that I<br>hed murdered Moodie, at least had escaped from<br>Glasgow as being charged with the murder, I made<br>it my study to keep in with them as far as in my<br>power lay, and now and then gave them a hearty<br>glass; they were so prudent as never to speak with me<br>on the subject, as to the murder of Moodie, which <br>somewhat enlightened my spirits, my conscience at<br>the same time was always troubling me: notwith<br>standing whereof, and of all which, I afterward<br>committed some acts of violence and outrage when in<br>London.<p>A certain person having accused me of having cri-<br>minal connection with my landlady, which I did not<br>like to be spoke of although true; I thereon fell in <br>passion, and stabbed and wounded him with a pen<br>knife in different places; that I was thereon immedi<br>ately apprehended, and committed to prison, when<br>stabbed myfelf with the said pen-knife, which was im-<br>mediately taken notice of by the blood flowing from<br>me: a surgeon was called for, and the wound was<br>sewed up. Where, after remaining for some time<br>and having undergone an examination, no proof being<br>brought against me, I was liberated, as the man and <br>recovered from our wounds, prior to which, it was<br>given out in Glasgow, that I was apprehended, and<br>taken up for killing a man in London. Had I know<br>after I was liberated, that I was to have been trouble <br>as to Moodie, after remaining so  long in London,<br>would have made my escape therefrom, but to my<br>surprise I was taken up, and apprehended by a Mr.<br>Williamson, messenger in Edinburgh, and thereafter<br>brought there, and committed prisoner to the<br>tolbooth of said place, where, after remaining to <br>some time, I was transmitted prisoner to, and lodged<br>in the tolbooth of Glasgow : where, after remain<br>for a short space, the circuit Lords justly condem<br>me to suffer death for the murder of the said Alexan-<br>der Moodie.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<p>I acknowledge the justness of my sentence.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  <br>turn my sincere thanks to the ministers of the go<br>elders, and others, for their pains, trouble and a<br>tion, in endeavouring to instruct me in the princ<br>of religion, and for the many prayers they have pu<br>for me,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and to the magistrates of the city for<br>kindness in frequently visiting me, since I received  <br>sentence, and for the many good advices they <br>given me, and to the keepers of the prison, wh<br>all times treated me with all manner of civility,<br>gave ready access, at all times, to ministers and <br>godly persons to visit me.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I would recommend<br>persons, beholding this  my untimely end, to<br>warning by me, and not to let their passion over <br>them, and I request of every person, who know<br>sees, or hears of this my untimely end, not to up <br>or cast up the same to those of my friends, relat[&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;]<br>or  connections.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;die a member of  the  church of<br>Scotland,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and I forgive all men that have any <br>injured  me,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and I pray  that God for Christ<br>may pardon all my sins.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  <p>Into thy hands, O God,  I commit my spirit.<p>JOHN M'MILLAN <p><p>ROBERT HAMILTON, Head Jailor,  }&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Witne<br> and JOHN RODGER, Inner turnkey.}</p>
