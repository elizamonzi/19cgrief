	<p> LAMENTATIONS.<p>An account taken from this days Star,<br>of the affecting behaviour and sorrowful<br>situation of Thomas Black, who is to be<br>Executed next Wednesday, when  the<br>respite for Reid was announced to him.<br>A1so, the Sorrowful Lamentation on<br>this awful occasion.<p>The following paragraph relative to Thomas Black who is<br>to Executed here on Wednesday first the 10th inst. for house-<br>breaking and theft, is copied from this day's (Friday 5th Dec.)<br>Edinburgh Star.<p>" The unfortunate young&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;man&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Black, who is now under<br>sentence of  Death in the jail of  this city, for housebreaking, <br>evinces, we understand,a most becoming sense of his melan-<br>choly situation, as well as, the deepest contrition for his dissolute<br>habits of life.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A few weeks ago he requested to be indulged<br>with a separate cell, as the society of his companions in misery<br>led to conversations on their former way of life, which served<br>to interrupt his more serious reflections, and to divert his mind<br>from those important considerations  which his awful situation<br>whs so powerfully calculated to excite.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A respite for his fel-<br>low-sufferer who is somewhat younger,  was received last week.<br>It can be no impeachment of the generosity of Black, or of the<br>sincerity of his repentance, to find that this act of mercy to an-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>other, awakened in him all that love of life which had seeming-<br>ly been extinguished for ever. He sunk into a state of rhe<br>most heartless despondency for some time, and he could neither<br>think of the present nor of the future without the most agoniz-<br>ing feelings. During 2 days he scarcely tasted food. His mind,<br>however, is now restored to its wonted tranquillity, and he ex-<br>presses himself with calmness and resignation on the subject of<br>his approaching fate, an event to which he looks forward as<br>inevitable.<p>Y c heedless youths who persevere,<br>Be warn'd and quit your mad career<br> View me, the victim of my crime,<br>Cut off before I've reach'd my prime.<p>By evil counsel drawn away,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>My wicked course I ran each day,<br>Till justice caught me in my race,<br>And brought me to this awful place.<p>My crimes and sins I now lament,<br>My youthful days and time mis-srent,<br>O may each one who views my end,<br>Be taught their time aright to spend.<p>The haunts of dissipation shun,<br>Avoid the wiles of those who run,<br>With wicked women, false though fair,<br>Who leave you cloth'd with black despair.<br>Farewell my friends, my comrades all,.<br>For you my tears in torrents fall,<br>Forgive, th' sffusions of my love,<br>We part in hope to meet above.<p>A few more hours, the struggle's past,<br>Life's curtain on this world is cast,<br>And then our spirits will soar above,<br>Where all is joy, and peace, and love.</p>
