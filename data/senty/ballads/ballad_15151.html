 CHORUS.<p>Young women all take my advice,<br>And mark what I do say,<br>And if you wed a dandy man,<br>You'll sure rue the day.<p>When I was twenty years of age a courting I did go,<br>Until a dandy barber's clerk did fill my heart with woe.<br>His mouth is like a turnpike gate his nose a yard and half<br>And if you saw his handsome less I'm sure they'd make<br>elaugh.<p>He got up one morning all by his own desire,<br>My leghorn bonnet and my cap he took to light the fire. <br>He took the tea things off the shelf for to clean off the dust<br>He wash'd them in  the chamber pot and dried them on<br>his shirt.<p>It was last Christmas,as true as I'm a sinner,<br>He said he'd stop at home all for to cook the dinner,<br>He took the plumbs and all the fat and mix'd them in his<br>bat,<br>And on the fire I do declare the rogue he boil d he cat.<p>He went one day indeed all for to buy a fowl,<br>He bought a hare I do declare, a  magpie and an owl,<br>He put them in the pot to boil tied with a dirty rope,'<br>Boil'd them with guts and feathers small and said they<br>were nice broth.<p>I thought a nice sweet pudding to dinner we should have<br>And as he stopt at home that day to cook it he did crave,<br>He put it in the pot to boil tied in a dirty sack,<br>And in it put his shaving box and half a pound of soap.<p>It's through the streets we walked arm and arm together,<br>It very fast began to freeze, he said it was rainy weather.<br>If he meets a coal cart he says it is a gig,<br>He cannot tell I do declare a dookie from a pig.<p>Is there a woman in the town can match the dandyman<br>He is a dirty rogue and lazy fool, it's nothing but the truth<br>If I had two I'd give the devil one to come and fetch them<br>both.<br>I wish my dandy husband was in the new police<br>And I was married to a sweep, O I would bless the day<br>To see' my dandy husband sent off to Botany Bay.<p>Old Mill Stream.<p>Is this the old mill stream, that ten years ago,<br>Was so fast in its current, so oure in its flow?<br>Whose musical waters would ripple and shine,<br>Like the glorious dash of a miniature rbine,<br>Can this be its bed, I remember it well, <br>When it sparkeled like silver through meadow and dell, <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Is this the old mill stream, &c.<br>And is this the old miller's house, peaceful abode,<br>Whose flower turned porch drew all eyes from the  road.<br>Where roses and jesmines embowered the door<br>That never shut to the way-worn or poor.<br>The miller, God bless him, oft gave us a dance,<br>And led off the ball with his soul in glance.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is this the old mill stream, &c.<br>The old mill is in ruins,and no welcome sound<br>In the mastiffs quick bark, or the wheel dashing round;<br>The house too is forgotton and left to decay,<br>And the miller long dead, all I loved passed away'<br>This plain place of childhood is graven in my heart<br>In rare paradise colours that now must depart,<br>The old water mill's gone, this fair vision is fled;<br>And I wept on its wreck as I do for the dead.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1st&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; sthe old mill stream,&c,<p>Braes o' Gleniffer<p>Keen blawst he wind o'er the braes o' Gleniffer.<br>The auld castle's turrents are covered wi' snew;<br>How changed frae the time when I met wi' my lover,<br>Amang the broom bushes by Stanley's green shaw<br>The wild flowers o' simmer were spread a' sae bonnie.<br>The mavis sang sweet frae the green barken tree;<br>But far to the camp they hae marched my dear Johnnie,<br>And now it is winter wi' nature and me.<p>Then ilk thing around us was blithesome and cheerie,<br>Then ilk thing around us was bonnie and braw;<br>Now nathing is heard but the wind whistling drearie,<br>And nathing is seen but the wide spreading snaw.<br>The trees are a' bare,and the birds mute and dowie,<br>They shake the cauld drift frae their wings as they flee<br>And chirp out their plaints seeming wae for my Jennie,<br>'Tis winter wi' them, and tis winter wi' me.<br>You cauldsleety cloud skifs alang the black mountain,<br>And shakes the dark firs on the steep rocky brae,<br>While down the deep glen brawls the snaw-flooded<br>mountain,<br>That murmured sae sweetly to my laddie and me.<br>Its no its loud roar, on the wint'ry winds swellin',<br>It's no the could blast brings the tear i' my e'e ;<br>For, O ! gin I saw but my bonny Scots callan,<br>The dark days o' winter were simmer to me</p>
