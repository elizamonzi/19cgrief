	<p>  Execution.<p>Account of the Execution of ANDREW STEWART and<br>EDWARD KELLY, who suffered in Glasgow on Wed-<br>nesday morning, 1st November, 1826, for Street Robbery<br>with an account of their Behaviour in confinement and on<br>the Scaffold<p>GLASGOW, 1st November, 1826,<p>This morning the above two unfortunate young men forfeited their lives for the <br>following daring  crimes :-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  <p>Andrew Stewart, for violently assaulting, along with some others, Filippo Testti,<br>Looking glass manfacture in  Gallowgate, and after striking him on the head till<br>he was insensible, robbing him of a gold watch, a gold chain, three gold seals, a gold<br>key, and several other articles ; also £211s. in cash.<p>Edward Kelly, for roboing James Fleming, in a closs in Bridgegate, on the 31st<br>March last, of £108 16s.; White, who was to have suffered along with him, has<br>since been respited.<p>Stewart, being a Protestant,  was attended  during his confinement, by several of<br>the Ministers of that persuasion, and by the Chaplain of the jail, who communicat-<br>ed every religious instruction of which he stood in need, and to whom he paid the<br>utmost Attention; he appeared completely resigned to his fate, and behaved with<br>the utmost decorum  since the awful sentence was passed upon  him. He always said<br>he had no intention of committing the robbery , and that  he fell in with the rest of<br>the  gang promiscuously and  meeting with the foreigner, some alteration took<br>place, which ended in him Knocking him down.<p>Kelly belonged to the Roman Catholic  church, and was assisted in his devotional <br>exercises by the Rev. Mr. Murdoch, the Minister of that persuasion in this  place,<br>to whom he listened with calmness, cheerfulness, and a desire to  improve his mind.<br>No opportunity was omitted by the Rev.  Gentleman in giving his attemdance to the<br>unfortunate youth, and soothing him with every consolation which his his awful state<br>required. which greatly comforted him in his lonely cell.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<p>The two unfortunate young men (after the services in the Hall were finished with <br>regard to Stewart),proceeded to the scaffold, attended  by their various Ministers,<br>where after spending a few minutes in prayer. they gave the signal, and were in-<br>-stantly launched into eternity.  they seemed to struggle little.  They were both<br>decently dressed.  the crowds assembled on such occasions are not so numerous  <br>since the alteration of the hour of execution.<p>Stewart was about 24 years of age, and  by trade a  weaver; he belongs to Bridge-<br>town , his parents are still living.  It does not appear that he had been formerly <br>addicted to crime.  He was unmarried.<p>Kelly was about 21 years of age, and followed, for some time, the profession of a <br>carter. He belongs to the Bridgegate, and his parents and three brothers are left<br>tomourn the fate of this unfortunate young man , his mother in particular, feels<br>with poignant grief, the loss of a son whom she loved most tenderly.<p>The above awful example should  prove a warning to all, especially to those who<br>are running  with heedless steps in the paths of crlme. Out of all the examples that<br>have taken place for a number of years past, not one crime can be attributed to need,<br>or want of employment, but arises from sytem of dishonesty instilled into them<br>by keeping bad company, and idle and dissipated habits Numerous are the houses<br>where the misguided youth of the city  receive shelter, and are kept hid from the<br>view of their  parents, and sent forth  to commit crimes of various description, no<br>matter at what expense.  It is calculated that there are nearly 5000 people in the<br>city and suburbs, who were they called upon to give an account how they gain a<br>livelihood, could give no satisfactory answer. It is to be hoped that all of them will<br>take warning, and shun those practices, which, if preseverd in, will end in a scene <br>similar to that witnessed to day.<p>W. Carse, Printer, Glasgow.</p>
