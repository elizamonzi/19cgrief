O Allan ! I'm indebted to thee,<br>It is a debt, dear Allan, I never can pay,<br> O Allan ! O Allan !  how came you for me ?<br> Sure I am not worthy your bride for to be.<p>How call you me Allan, when Sandy's my name ?<br>Why call you me Allan ? sure you are to blame :&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>For don't you remember when at school with thee,<br>I  was hated by all the rest, but loved by thee ?<p>How oft have I fed on your bread and your cheese ?<br>Likewise when you had but a handful of pease ;<br>Your cruel-hearted father hounded at me his dogs,<br>They tore my bare heels, and rave all my rags.<p>Is this my dear Sandy whom I lov'd so dear ?<br>I have not heard of you this many a year ;<br>When all the rest went to bed, sleep was frae me,<br>For thinking on what was become of thee.<p>My parents were born lang before me,<br>Perhaps by this time they are drown d in the sea,<br>These lands and possessions they left them to me,<br>And I come for you, jewel, to share them with thee.<p>In love we began, and in love we will end,<br>And in joy and mirth our days we will spend :<br>And a voyage to your father once more we will go,<br>And relieve the old farmer from his trouble and woe.<p>With men and maid-servants us to wait upon,<br>So away to her father in a chaise they are gone ;<br>The laddie went foremost, the brave Highland loun,<br>Till they came to the road that leads to the town.<p>When he came to the gate, he gave a loud roar,<br>Come down, gentle farmer, Catherine's at your door ;<br>When he look'd out the window, he saw his daughter's face,<br>With his hat in his hand he made a great phrase.<p>Keep on your hat, farmer, don't let it fa',<br>For it sets not the peacock to bow to the craw ;<br>It's hold your tongue, Sawney, and do not taunt me,<br>For my daughter's not worthy your bride for to be.<p>Now he held his bridle reins till he came down,<br>And then he conveyed him to a fine room ;<br>With the finest of spirits they drank a fine toast,<br>And the son and the father drank both in one glass.</p>
