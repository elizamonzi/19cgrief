	<p> Fatal Love!<p>Warning to Lovers.<p>A Full and Authentic ACCOUNT of a most Mclancholy<br>and Extraordinary occurrence of FATAL LOVE,<br>which took place at Kincardine, on Thursday last;<br>together with a COPY of the Very affecting LETTER,<br>which was found in the young Woman's bosom<br>after she was out down, and which fully explains<br>the cause of her committing this rash and fatal act<p>On Thursday last, Miss M'C-------n, daughter of a respectable gen-<br>tleman in Kincardine, was found suspended from the ceiling of her<br>own room. She made use of a scarf for the purpose: she rose that<br>morning very early, and one of the servants in passing her room<br>heard a noise ; she went to see, but was struck on beholding the<br>young lady suspended from the ceiling ; she called for assistance,<br>which soon arrived, but the lamp of life had ceased to burn, and<br>nothing was left but to weep at her untimely and rash conduct.<br>At her father's death, she would have fallen heiress to an income<br>of about  £400 a-year. A West Indian Captain caused this rash<br>act, he having held out promises which he never intended to fulfil,<br>and who sailed for the West Indies before her remains were laid in<br>the silent grave,<p>The following beautiful and interesting lines was found in her<br>bosom next morning, after she was cut down :....<p>" Dear CAPTAIN,....If my exhausted spirits would support my<br>trembling hand, whilst I write a few lines to ease a broken heart, it<br>would be the last office I would require them to do. Then may<br>they leave me: then may I find in my grave a retreat from the<br>scoin of men. How is my gold become dim, and my most fine<br>gold become drass. I do not now command you by the awful<br>name of virtue to accuse you of the basest ingratitude, ah no, the<br>scene is entirely changed ; you have robbed me, cruelly robbed<br>me of the brightest gem in the female character, and I come as an<br>humble supplicant. Is this possible?am I awake, or do I dream ?<br>Ah ! poor deluded girl, think not what you are; how can I rest<br>from calling to remembrance those days of innocence and peace,<br>when, with a sincere countenance and sincere heart, I could look<br>up to heaven, and beg that the God of purity would be my pro-<br>tector ;....but ah ! how am I changed, how is my virtue faded, how<br>doth conscious guilt fill my soul, whilst blushes cover my face ; sad<br>reflections on my present state hurry me to meditate on the future;<br>which opens so tremendous a scene to my views, as to strike me<br>back in doleful remembrance of the past time.<p>If I fly to my parents, who were once all my comfort, they bathed<br>in tears, cry out, you have brought our gray hairs with sorrow to<br>the grave. If, to get one moment's ease, I wander into the<br>fields, every flower seems to say, we are pure. Thus is all nature<br>armed against me. And on whose account do I seem to be for-<br>saken by heaven and earth !....on your account, who strove to gain<br>my affections, and become master of them ; and now you triumph<br>over me?laugh at me for trusting to your honour, and putting<br>Confidence in your word.<p>--------O inconstant men,<p>How will you promise?how deceive !<p>O hypocrisy, how couldst thou wear so winning a form ??Gene-<br>rosity, where art thou fled ??Honour, hast thou forsaken the human<br>race ??Look on my distress, O my God. Despise me not, O my<br>friends---forgive me, my distressed parents: then may the cold<br>grave receive me into its peaceful recesses, where my shame may<br>be buried in eternal oblivion. Now, if your heart be not as hard<br>as adamant, if your conscience is not seared as with a hot iron,<br>some past scenes must appear to your view. I do not now summon<br>you to appear at His awful tribunal ; I find you are still too near<br>my heart; for all your cruelty to me, my return is, May you in<br>the hour of death find that consolation from your God and Judge,<br>you have denied to your<p>  AMELIA M'C?-N."<p><br>Price One Penny.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
