	<p> A full account of the Trial and Sentence of William<br>Pollock, for the barbarous murder of his Wife, who<br>is to be executed at Edinburgh on the 22d March. <p>William.Pollock, a labourer,residing at Gifford's Park, was<br>put to the Bar, accused of the 'murder of Ana Renny or Pollock, life<br>wife, CB the 11th of November last&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The prisoner pleaded not guilty.<br>The indictment was found relevant.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Catherine Berry or Mrs<br>Leishman, examined by Mr'Wood.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Knows the prisoner at the<br>bar, he came to her house about, one o'clock in the morning of the<br>12th November last, and said that he wished she would come and<br>see what she thought of Nannie as he never saw her in the same state<br>before; witness did not then go as she had frequently heard them<br>qnarreliing, and did not like to' interfere, that, panel having- gone<br>away, came back in about too minutes, and said, ' for God's sake<br>come and see what you think of her,' witness then went to the pri-<br>soner's house, on going in the body of the panel's wife attracted her<br>attention, it. was lying on the shavings, her head inclined upwards ;<br>her left log was under her, and her right a little bent, she had all her<br>elothes on,  even her boots,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;her right arm was inclined across her<br>bresst. the left, was at her side.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Witness went forward aud&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;took<br>hold of deceaseds aral to feel her pulse, she felt it quite cold, and<br>her pulse was gone.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There was very little fire in the  room, observ-<br>ed a great deal of blood just where the deceased was lying-, and there<br>was about nine inches of blood spread on the floor at. the side of the<br>bed, also a Jump of congealed  blood a good way from the shavings ;<br>at the end of the  table there was as large a quantity of blood,<br>as was bing  at the body by Pollock's: bed. The whole of deceased's<br>clothes from  the waist  downwards, were covered with blood 5 did<br>not observe any blood on the woollen cloth which covered the shav-<br>ings, or on the shavings, themselves; witnessed examined the floor;<br>but there was no blood on it till you came&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to where the deceased<br>was lying.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There was no person in the room when witness went in<br>«-:except a little  about fire years old, the son of the pannel; when<br>she went she said , " Polhock, your wife is gon," he said, " do you<br>think SO," -.witness said,  " I do not think so, tor I am sure of it;"<br>prisoner exclaimed, " Good God," and appeared much&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;agitated,<br>but  did not evince much sorry.  The little boy said to witness, that<br>?' Daddy had bleked mummy," at which pannel in an  angry man-<br>her turned round to. the child, end said, " Did I kick your mammy<br>to which the child replied, " No, no," and-hid himself under the<br>bed clothes ; nobody else was present.<p>Dr White,?Remembered  the prinoner coming to his house about<br>two or three in the morning of the 12th November;  prisoner desired<br>him to come and see his wife, remarking that he believed she was<br>dead. Witness, on entering. the panel's house, found the body of a<br>woman stretched across the- floor, and a quantity of blood and somo<br>Pieces of cart henware were upon the floor near the bed. Remers-<br>hers seeing a Woman named Leishman in the house  when beentered<br>it; she derired witness to examine the body.. Witness proceeded to<br>do so, and found that a  severe wound had been inflieted in the vulva,<br>(Here Dr. White read his medical affidavit, describing the nature of<br>the wound he had found in the deceased's body; it was upwards of)<br>an inch in length, and three inches deep.) Witness had no doubt<br>this wound had been the cause of the deceased's death. Witness re-<br>turned to Pollock's house between pine and ten in the morning, when<br>he found Dr. Black there.Further examined : Does not think the<br>wound could have been inflicted by a fall; its direction was down-<br>wards towards the pelvum, and backwards towards the gut; it ap-<br>peared as if deceased had been standing when she received the<br>wound. Mrs Leinhman did not appear to be the worse of liquor,<br>nor incapahable of lending assistance, though she did not assist wit-<br>ness ; has no recollection of making on observation that a kick could<br>not have done so much barm to the deceased; he was satisfied that<br>attack could not be the  iceneion  of her death; witness only remark<br>ed, while in Pollock's house, that the case did not look well. Did<br>not observe any smell of spirits about the deceased s body, had she<br>been intoxicated at the time of her death witness might have de-<br>tected it; saw no appearance of deceased having been vomiting. Mr<br>Bleck examined the wound in witness's presence ; saw Mr B. after<br>probbing the wound  with his finger, apply a knife to the orifice,<br>which Mr B remarked appeared to fit  it; witness thought the wound<br>must, have been inflicted with the knife, or some similar weapon; it,<br>might have been done with a razor, but more probably with a knife<br>such as that now exhibited.<p>Dr Black examined by Mr Alison; read his report describing- the<br>nature of the wound which he had observed on the drceased's person.<br>This gentlemen was of opinion that, the deceased must have been in<br>a recumbent posture when she received the wound in question. He<br>was satisfied that it was inflicted By the knife exhibited in Court,<br>And not. by a fell on any sharp fragments of pottery ware; Does<br>net think pannel's wife, could by any possibility, have inflicted the<br>wound in question apon herself.<p>The Lord justice Clerk having summed up the evidence at, great<br>length, the july returned a viva voce vereiet finding. the pannel guil-<br>ty The sentence was de'ay until 2 o'clock this day.<p> Tuesday 2 o'clock?The Court met again this day, and after a<br>most impressive admonition, the judge senteneced him to be execut-<br>ed at Edinburgh on 22d March, end his body given for dissection.</p>
