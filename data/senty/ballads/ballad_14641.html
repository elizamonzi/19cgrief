	<p>   TRIAL OF A<p>PRIEST<p>A wonderful trial of a Priest for the horrid and cruel mur-<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;der of a young Lady, (whom he had seduced,) and her<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mother, after robbing&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;them of an  immense fortune ;<br>with an account of other five girls whom he had be-<br>trayed all of whom he privately married ; with his ad-<br>dress to&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the  judges&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; in  mitigation&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;punishment<br>for his horrid crimes; The trial lasted near four years.<p>TAKEN FROM THE SUN OF SATURDAY THE 5th. SEPTEMBER, 1829.<p>A trial for murder of a very singular and horrible crime, before the Su-<br>preme Criminal Court in Bavaria, has just terminated. The trial occupi-<br>ed no less than four years, and the pleadings and documents amounted to<br>forty two volumes, the criminal was examined one hundred times, and it<br>was only at the last examination that a confession of his guilt was wrung<br>from him. Riembaur the criminal was born in the lowest rank, but at<br>a very early age gave marks of an intellect of a superior order, Riem-<br>bur was born in 1770, in 1795 he was ordained a priest, in 1808 he was<br>appointed a curate of Priell, and in 1809 he was promoted to the curacy<br>of Randersdt. His sermons were eloquent; his denounciations of vice<br>severe and frequent. It is not wonderful that so accomplished and gifted<br>as he was, with the addition of an elegant person, he should be looked<br>on as a saint of the fire water. The crimes for which this monster was<br>tried, were chiefly incontinency. He had a child by the curate of Hus-<br>kerchen's cook-maid, a second by the curate of Hernsheim's servant, a<br>third by a milliner of his acquaintance, a fourth by another servant-maid<br>a fifth by Madame Frauenkneicht, whose father he swindled out of five<br>thousand Florins, and whom, together with her mother, he poisoned ,<br>and lastly, he had several children by his last kitchen-maid. The crime<br>for which he was at length arrested was the murder of Anne Marie Ei-<br>chlaetter. Whilst in the act of cutting the unhappy girls  throat, her<br>youngest sister happened to peep through the key-hole, and observed<br>the unhuman monster bloody actions, he would have been denounced<br>long before, but he threatened to commit suicide, and induced the mo-<br>ther to bury the transaction in silence. Shortly alter the murder they<br> both fell sick, and died, from the effects of poison administered by the<br>priest. In his address to the Judge he admits of all the charges brought<br>against him, and that he privately married them all at the alter, for the<br>purpose of quelling their consciences. He also defended himself, with<br>saying that the end sanctifies the means. He said that before killing<br> his victims, he generally exhorted them to repent of their sins, and gave<br>them absolution. This holy ruffian has been condemned to imprison-<p> ment for an unlimited period.<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  Carmichael &Graham, Printers, 43, Trongate.</p>
