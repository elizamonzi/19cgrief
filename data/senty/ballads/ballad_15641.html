	<p> T  H&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;E<p>  Tnicklarian Doctor's <p>Lamentation<p>For the Absence of his Majesty King<br>GEORGE, and the old Antient<br>Parliament.<p>GREAT Sir,I am now become Your humble Servant, when I can do no<br> better: I am not so well aquaint with your Majesty is I was with<br>Your Predecessor; but however, I hear tell you are an right Honest Man,<br>but seeing makes believing: There are many in Scotland will not believe it,<br>till ye come to them, and give every one of them a Loaf and a great pice of Flesh<br>and a Flagen of Wine as King David did to all his People both to the Men and<br>to the Women; and believe my Word, my Wife will never have that kind-<br>ness to your Majesty as she ought to have before ye do it. Cur poor Peo-<br>ple are glad of Meat and Drink, but Your Majesty will fay we are Re-<br>bells, we are not worthy of either Meat or Drink: I consess we have not<br>that love to your Majesty as Jonathan had to David: Put however if ye<br>would come to Scotland, and fill me fow of Meat and Drink, I shall both<br>Fight for you and Pray for you, which is not my ordinary, your Majesty gets<br>but few Prayers except from thosethat hath Posts and Pensions from you in<br>Scotland, but if ye would come to us, and give us that small Thing that we de-<br>fire, we shall all of us Pray whole sail for your Majesty, which will do more<br>good then the Ministers Prayers, ye may know that it was for your example<br>that it was Cronicled, how much Meat and Drink that King gave to his Peo-<br>ple, what is my bussiness to read about his Meat and his Drink, for I cannot be<br>the better of it but rather the worse. The Parliament made you King but the<br>poor in Scotland hath found little Favour by it by reason of your Majestys<br>absence and our old Custom of Parliament. (But your Majesty will say we<br>may come to you if we Want) But I say your Parliament hath laid so much duty<br>Upon the Leather, (that we cannot get shoon to carry us up to you ) I hope<br>your Majesty will not be offended because I beg a Favour from Your Majesty<br>seeing the greatest in our Nation sikes Posts from You ? and there are many that<br>hath Posts under your Majesty which is not wordy of it, especiall those that<br>that I shall Name.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<p>Collonl Mack-kartney that Sticked Duke Hamiltoun.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nixt the Watter<br>broke the Skin of both my Legs, and a loss that if was not the Bone.<p>Nixt the Pope that was seeking with a Sword.<p>Ednburgh, Printed for the Author R.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; s, and to be Sold at his Dwelling-House at the Head of the college- wynd.</p>
