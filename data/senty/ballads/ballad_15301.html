	<h2>Transcription</h2>
	<p> COPY of a very interesting Letter from<p>Botany-bay<p>Received in Glasgow, a few days ago, from<br>one of the Persons engaged in the un-<br>fortunate affair of Bonnymuir, giving<br>a particular account of the situation of<br>the whole of the people who were trans-<br>ported for being concerned on that un-<br>happy occasion; with a description of<br>that Colony.<p>THE following very interesting Letter was received a few<br>days ago from Thomas M'Culloch, Stocking-wever, adress-<br>ed to his wife in Glasgow, dated.<p>Sydney, New South Wales, October 21, 1821.<br>I send you these few lines hoping they will find you and<br>the children in good health as they leave me at present, thank<br>God for it. We arrived here on the 18th of May, all in good<br>health (after being at sea five months). I was taken off the stores<br>by a Mr. Panton a native of Scotland, and employed by him<br>as a labourer; but not agreeing with me he was so kind as to<br>transfer me to a Captain Irvine, and I am to be with him as a<br>house-servent, and l am going to remove about 40 miles up the<br>country.<p>If you think of coming here, there shall be nothing wanting<br>on my part to bring you. as I have every encouragement from<br>several Gentlemen that can enable me to do so, as your presence<br>here will free me from bondage ; as any man's wife that comes<br>here as a free settler, can take her husband from Government<br>employment, or being a servant to any of them. Captain Irvine<br>has promised to do every thing for us to make us comfortable.<br>By your friends applying to the Secretary of State at London,<br>you could obtain for us 3 or 400 acres of land. It is Andrew<br>Dawson's wish that his wife would come here also, and we will<br>endavour to get you out both together; but if you do not think<br>of coming, I hope that you and the rest of my friends will do all<br>they can to obtain a mitigation of my sentence, as my mind<br>never can be at rest till I be with you and the rest of my family.<p>Sir Thomas Brisbane arrived here two days ago ; he is to be<br>our new Governor, and the Governor can pardon any man he<br>thinks proper; a great many have obtained their liberty since we<br>arrived here; Captain Irvine Mr. Wyeems, Commissary General,<br>and the other Gentlmen, have promised to befriend us; and the<br>whole of our party is much respected here by the most respect-<br>able people in this country, and if you will only come out, a<br>steady man and woman can do well, as they are very rare articles<br>to be found here.<p>Andrew Dawson, James Cleland, J. M'Millan, and A. Murchie<br>are kept in Government employment on account of their being<br>blacksmiths who are valuable in this part of the world; W. Clark-<br>son and John Anderson is with Mr. Lord, a respectable Gentle-<br>man, who much esteem them; A. Johnson is principal servant<br>to the Commissary General; Thomas M'Farlane and Thomas<br>Pink are with the Barrack Master ; James Wright is a shopman<br>to A Dr. Phillips; Benjamin Moir, John Barr, and David Thom-<br>son, is with Sir John Jameson ; Andrew White, bookbinder ;<br>and Alex. Hart, cabinet-maker, are in Paramatta with Dr. Douglas;<br>Wm. Smith is also at Paramatta, with Mr. Marsden, Robt. Gray<br>and Alex. Lattimer, is in Ven Dieman's Land with Mr Mulgrave,<p>This is a fine country, and will grow any thing that will grow<br>in any other country, and in general have three croops a-year.<br>Loaf bread 3d per lb., butter 2s. per lb., beef and mutton 10d.,<br>eggs 2s. a dozen, tea 2s. 6d, per lb., sugar 6d, potatoes 10s. per<br>cwt. A free labourer gets from 25s. to 30s a-week, and a trades-<br>man who has a trade to suit this part of the country can make it<br>a great deal better. I see Gilbert M'Leod, (late printer of the<br>" Spirit of the Union,") often?he is very well and is acting as<br>a schoolmaster. The letter concludes with compliments to a<br>number of friends and acquaintances, and he requests to be<br>remembered to his shopmates.<p>THOMAS M'CULLOCH.</p>
