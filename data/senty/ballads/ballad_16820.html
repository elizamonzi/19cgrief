	<h2>Transcription</h2>
	<p> A True COPY of the Paper delivered to the Sheriff, by Captain  JOHN<br>BRUCE, who was Execute at Lancaster the 2d of October, 1716.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <p>FRIENDS and BRETHREN,<p>I Am brought to this Place to discharge the Debt I owe to Nature, and do chearfully<br>resign to the Blessed Will of Almighty GOD; whose Mercies I adore, in that He<br>has afforded me His Grace and Means sincerely to Repent me of my past Sins, and<br>such Time to prepare for that blessed and glorious Change, which I hope to meet with<br>in a few Minutes.<p>I'm not ashamed for that Gause for which I die ; but rejoice that I am worthy to be<br>a Sacrifice, in the Vindication of the undoubted Right of my Lawful and Natural Liege<br>Lord King James the Third, and the Expiring Liberties of my dear Country.<p>I always believed the Hereditary Right of Succession to the Imperial Crowns of these<br>Realms, to be a Fundamental and Unalterable Part of the Constitution; and could never<br>think that any Difference in Religion, or any of the pretended Laws which never yet<br>received the Regal Assent of any Lawful King, could aniwise disengage me, or any ho-<br>nest Man, from that Duty and Allegiance which is due to our lawful Sovereign King<br>James the Third, whose Title, by Birthright, is clear and unquestionable : And was<br>therefore engaged, by the strictest Obligations of true Honour, Religion and Law, to<br>join with his Majesty's Loyal Subjects, in the Just Endeavours to Restore him to his Rights,<br>and break thro' the Usurpation and Fence of Rebellion, which hath so long kept him<br>from them. GOD, in His Mercy, forgive these Kingdoms, incline the Hearts of the<br>People, as one Man, to bring in their Lawful King ; and free themselves from the merci-<br>less Tyranny they now groan under.<p>I'm now grown in Years, and not much short of what the Royal Psalmist calls the Age<br>of Man; and have known many Struggles, in order to preserve the Constitution, and<br>sinking Liberty of the People, and several Turns and Changes that have ensued: In all<br>which, praised be GOD, I preserved my Integrity, by a strict Adherence to my King<br>and Country; opposing as far as in me lay, the Innovations that were daily introduced to<br>the Injury of the one, and enslaving of the other.<p>As one Wickedness is, the Parent of another, so the Revolution begat the Union, and<br>from these Sources flow the Whalers of Bitterness, which the Good People of these Na-<br>tions so plentifully drink of at this Time. May GOD, of His infinite Mercy, work<br>their speedy Deliverance, and restore them to their ancient happy Constitution and Go-<br>vernment.<p>As for my Religion, I was bred up a Protestant according to the Doctrine and Dis-<br>cipline of the Church of England, wherein I have ever liv'd, and in which, by GOD'S<br>Grace and Mercy, I shall die. It taught me to give both GOD and my King Their<br>Due, to deal justly with all Men, forgive mine Enemies, and expect Salvation thro' Jesus<br>Christ. Her Doctrine and Government I embrace, and pray GOD to restore her to<br>her former Purity, Peace and Prosperity.<p>I beseech all whom I have anywise offended to forgive me, as I, from the Bottom of<br>my Heart, do all who have anywise injured me, and particularly those who were con-<br>cerned in my Prosecution, or anywise Instrumental in promoting my Death. I forgive<br>that greatest of Injuries, their surprising me into a Confession of their Indictment, by<br>bringing me to a Trial Two Days before the Time mentioned in their Notice, and with-<br>out ever giving me any Copy of their Jury; being a Scotsman, and a Stranger to the<br>Laws of England, I was the more liable to be imposed upon : GOD forgive them,<br>as I freely do.<p>I think it incumbent on me to take this last Opportunity, of vindicating my Honour<br>from that Report which traduced me as unfaithful to his Grace the Duke of Hamilton,<br>whilst I had the Honour, which was about 24 Years, to be with him as a Companion and<br>humble Servant: And here by declare, upon the Words of a Dying Man, and as I shall<br>answer it before Almighty GOD, That what hath been said to asperse me upon that<br>Account, was intirely False; and any Displeasure his Grace conceived against me con-<br>cerning it, intirely Groundless. I always loved him, and dealt faithfully by that Noble<br>Duke, as GOD, the Righteous Judge, will witness for me.<p>Thus have I discharged my Conscience, and now, blessed be Almighty GOD, that<br>hath brought me to this happy Period of my Pilgrimage. I have finished a long<br>Course, and adhered, without Wavering, to my King, the LORD's Anointed, his<br>Cause ; for, and in which I die: And I hope this Day to be with my Saviour, tran-<br>slated thither, to rejoice with other Loyal Sufferers, and all the Saints and Angels, for<br>Evermore.<p>LANCASTER,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  Sie Subscribitur,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;JOHN BRUCE.<p>October 2. 1716.</p>
