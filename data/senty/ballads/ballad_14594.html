	<p> RESPITE<p>FOR<p>William Grieve.<p><p>An Account of a Respite for Fourteen Days having<br>arrived for WILLIAM GRIEVE, who lies under sentence<br>of Death in Edinburgh for Rape, and who was to<br>have been Executed this day (Wednesday); to-<br>gether with a copy of original VERSES on the occa.<br>sion.<p>THIS unfortunate man WILLIAM GRIEVE, now under sen<p>tence of Death for Rape, and who was to have been executed<br>this day, (Wednesday, the 3d April, 1833,) has been respited for<br>fourteen days, until certain facts which have transpired since his<br>condemnation shall be investigated. It is very currently reported<br>that the principal witness on the trial has made very important dis-<br>closures, which is expected will have the effect of giving an entirely<br>different complexion to the case, and may ultimately lead to the<br>liberation of the unfortunate man. An examination into the cir-<br>cumstances took place on Saturday last in Haddington, for the pur-<br>pose of eliciting the supposed new facts of the case, which we sin-<br>cerely hope will prove favourable to Grieve, as it seems to be the<br>general wish of the public at large, who have known or heard par-<br>ticularly of his awful situation.<p>On the respite having been communicated to him by the proper<br>authorities, he is reported to have broke forth into transports of<br>joy and gratitude as soon as with decency he could do so, ejaculat-<br>ing almost incoherent expressions of gratulations and thanks to our<br>gracious Sovereign and his Council for the boon bestowed on him.<br>On hearing of the above gratifying intelligence, an ingenious poeti-<br>cal correspondent of ours penned the following EFFUSIONS, as if<br>they were written by Grieve himself, of which we have obtained a<br>Copy:?<p>The Heart-felt Gratulations of William Grieve, on<br>getting a Respite for Fourteen Days.<p>Friends of the weaker vessel,<p>My thanks I give to you,<br>And shou'd I ever carry more,<p>To you I will prove true.<br>Live stock is not easy carried,<p>Which Nature must give in ;<br>What wou'd come o'er the cart, dear friends,<p>Wou'd it lose the RACKIN PIN.<p>Six glass o' Whisky she partook,<p>As we were on the road ;<br>I was to blame for giving such,<p>Which brought me to the GAD.<p>Had I but thought upon a plan,<p>To see her rightly booked,<br>I wou'd have bound her hand and foot,<p>But my book I ne'er looked.<p>I promise and I now declare,<p>By a' the powers aboon,<br>I'll never have live stock again,<p>I'll rather sell auld shoon.<p>But since my King has been so kind,<p>And a' the powers about him,<br>Speak ill o' him, by honest Jove,<p>I'd tak' my whip and whip him.<p>O gin I had my horse and graith,<p>And whip hung o'er my shouther,<br>I'd die upon the road, dear friends,<p>Or eat my horses fother.<p>I'll ne'er again have living stock<p>But my dear honest wife,<br>For she is true, and she is mine,<p>And will be while I've life.<p>Francis M'Cartney.........One Penny.</p>
