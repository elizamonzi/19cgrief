	<p> The W E A S E L Uncas'd, or the In and Outside of<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a P R I E S T drawn to the Life.<p>A Protestant Priest, a Man of great Fame,<br>To be Rich and Great was his only Aim, <br>It was Dr. Weasel, the very same,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  Which no body can deny.<p>This Weasel at first to get him some Grub,<br>A little small Girl, and a little good Bub,<br>Diogenes like, he Preached in a Tub,<br>Which, &c.<p>Yet in those Days he was very Fickle,<br>And though he was Head of a great Conventicle,<br>Yet he had a Months mind to be higher a little,<br>Which, &c.<p>And finding Ambition to grow with his Pride,<br>And if he'd be great he must change his Side,<br>He left all his Flock, and his first Faith deny'd,<br>Which, &c.<p>By which they perceiv'd his Heart was grown Evil,<br>They put forth a Book, which he thought uncivil,<br>The Title was, Weasel's Dispute with the Devil,<br>Which,&c.<p>In which Learned Piece they there did discover,<br>That, like unto Judas, he was a false Brother,<br>And of a full Bag he is a great Lover,<br>Which, &c.<p>To which bloody Charge he answer'd in Season,<br>And why he left them, told 'em his Reason,<br>And prov'd all their Tenets border'd on Treason,<br>Which, &c.<p>And then, like a Hero, he did lay about.<br>And swore he Would Preach all their Tub-bottoms out;<br>And prove them to be a Phanatical Rout,<br>Which, &c.<p>And truly he was as good as his Word,<br>And writ a fine Book, though by them abhorr'd,<br>The Case of Resistance, which stands on Record,<br>Which, &c.<p>In that Loyal Piece, against the Precise,<br>He prov'd by all the Grave, Learned and Wise,<br>Obedience is better than all Sacrifice,<br>Which, &c.<p>And then he proceeded by Scripture and Reason,<br>To prove Non-Resistance always in Season,<br>And its opposite Doctrine no less than Treason,<br>Which, &c.<p>And having observ'd the Laws o'th' Nation,<br>With those of the Gospel, had a Relation,<br>Said, those that Resist would receive just Damnation,<br>Which, &c.<p>To strengthen this Point he quoted St. Paul,<br>St. Peter, St.Jude, our Saviour and all,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[fall,<br>Proving none cou'd be Sav'd who from that Faith did<br>Which, &c.<p>But what will you say of this Weasel stout,<br>If after all this he shou'd face about,<br>And in print tell the World in truth he was out,<br>Which, &C.<p>Yet Reason and Conscience a War did begin,<br>And struggled with Pride and Ambition within,<br>To take the new Oaths he long thought a Sin,<br>Which, &C.<p>His Spouse, like Job's Wife, to ease his Heart-aching,<br>Did press him to swear that he was mistaken,<br>Though some think it was for to save his Bacon,<br>Which,&C.<p>At first he did doubt, and therefore did pray,<br>That Heaven wou'd instruct him in the Right way,<br>Whether Jimmy or William he ought to obey,<br>Which, &c.<p>The Pass at the Boyne determin'd that Case,<br>And Precept to Providence then did give place,<br>To change his Opinion he thought no disgrace,<br>Which, &c.<p>For though he had done the same Thing before,<br>Yet now for his Comfort he need Change no more,<br>For his Case of Allegiance will serve for a score,<br>Which, &c.<p>For there he has plainly made it appear,<br>That Strength gives a Right, therefore we may swear<br>To him in Possession, though not the Right Heir,<br>Which, &c.<p>And shou'd a Fray happen 'twixt Father and Son,<br>If the Boy beat his Father, and so make him Run,<br>Providence had appointed that Thing to be done,<br>Which, &c.<p>Besides, he has prov'd the mighty Conveniance<br>Of Subjects transferring their Faith and Allegiance,<br>To those that can crush 'em all into Obedience,<br>Whicb, &c.<p>So let 0. P. or P. 0. be King,<br>Or any one else, it is the same Thing,<br>For only Heaven does that Blessing bring,<br>Which, &c.<p>But this with the Scripture can never agree,<br>As Hosea the Eighth, and the Fourth you may see.<br>They have set up Kings, but yet not by me,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>Which, &.c.<p>Now what need the Prophet there to complain,<br>If the Peoples Anointed, and God's were the same?<br>If so, David's Friends they all were to blame,<br>Which, &c.<p>For though God permitted the People to bring<br>Good David's Son forth, and proclaim him King,<br>Yet all the World knows how he punish'd the Thing,<br>Which, &c.<p>And may all such Sons enjoy the same Fate,<br>That dethrone their Father, and him Abdicate,<br>No doubt it will happen in time, soon or late,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>Which, &c.<p>With one Remarck more I'le end this dull Song,<br>And his fulsom Republican Arguments strong,<br>Which makes Wrong to be Right,and Right to be wrong,<br>Which, &c.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<p>That Famous old Priest, the Vicar of Bray,<br>Who in all Change of Times knew how to obey,<br>Was an Ass to the Weasel, if I may so say,<br>Which, &c.<p>And truly I think no more need be said,<br>By a Penny we know how a Shilling's made,<br>For Priest and Priest-craft is all but a Trade,<br>Which, &c,<p>And thus I in little have drawn to the Life,<br>His Flesh and his Spirit alway at Strife,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>But the Flesh did prevail by the help of his wife<br>Which no body can deny, deny<br>which no body can d<p>F&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;N&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;S.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
