	<p>  Trial  and Sentence<p>A Full and .Particular Account of the Trial and Sen-<br>tence'of CHARLES M'EWEN, who is to be Exe-<br>cuted at Edinburgh, ou Wednesday the 7th of April.<br>1824,for the Barbarous Murder of Margaret Mo-<br>ney, and his body to be given for dissection.<p>YESTERDAY, March 1, 1824, came On before the High Court<br> of Justiciary, the Trial of Roders M'Leod, alias John M'In-<br>tyre, alias Charles M'Intosh, alias Charles M'Ewen, alias Charles<br>M,Kay, accused of the wilful murder of Margaret Money, with <br>whom he had previously cohabited as man and wife, by striking <br>her on the head with a small iron anvil, on Thursday the 9th of<br>October, 1823, on the uninhabited, moor or mountain, commonly<br>called the Firmonth, and at a  part near to the junction of the shires<br>of  Aberdeen and Forfar, and in the immediate vicinity of a Loch<br>called. Lochmavens..<p>The prisoner pled Not Guilty.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The anvil, a coat, and pair of<p>trowsers,  stained  with  blood, with various articles of  women's  <p>wearing apparel, all stained with blood, were brought before the<p>court,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Two declarations, emitted before the Sheriff substitute of<p>Aberdeenshire,  and two surgical reports, dated and, signed, were<p>also produced to the court.<p>The List contained 42 witnesses, but a few were only examined.<br>The evidence showed that the murder was deliberately commit-<br>ted, without any provocation ; it was proved by the people of the<br>house, where they slept the night previous to the murder, that they<br>both left, the house in good humour; and he had taken the most<br>unfrequented part of the road to commit the horrid deed.<p>Three witnesses who were present when Dr Garie compared the<br>anvil with the wounds,.proved either that they corresponded exactly,<br>or that they were as near alike as any one would expect or imagine.<p>Two ather witnesses deposed that they saw the deceased and the<br>prisoner together proceeding towards Firmouth. On his arrival at<br>the the first-house his trowsers were dripping with rain and blood,<br>and there were  marks below his knees as though he had knelt in<br>blood. Ae was restless of night, and frequently called for. whisky.<br>On the Saturday he asked his landlord if he had heard of the wo-<br>man being killed on Firmouth ; and on the witness's saying he did<br>not believe it he said it was certainly true, for he had seen her all<br>over blood, as he passed, and she surely had been murdered.<p>The Lord Justice Clerk having summed up the evidence at full<br>length, with his usual clearness, the jury without leaving the box,<br>returned as unanimous verdict of Guilty against the pannel.<p>His Lordship, after a most impressive address, in which he re<br>commended to the prisoner to employ the few remaining days<br>he is allowed on earth in the important works of repentance, and<br>to endeavour, by the deepest contrition and heartfelt sorrow for.<br>his past offences, to make his peace with that God against whom<br>he had so heinously sinned, by the perpetration of a crime, of all<br>others the most foul and detestable: after the address, the panel<br>asked liberty to speak for a minute, which was not granted.<p>His Lordship then proceeded to pronounce upon the unfortunate<br>man the awful sentence of the law, which was, that he is to be<br>hanged by the hands of the public executioner, on Wednesday the<br>7th day of April next, at the head of Libbertons's Wynd, betwixt<br>the hour of eight and ten in the morning; and his body thereafter<br>to be given to Dr Alex. Monro to be dissected and anatomized.<br>The prisoner then said, " Thank your Lordship, but I'll die in-<br>nocent.<p>M'Ewan is a tall,stout-made man, and stood with a firmness,<br>and composure bordering on hardenednes, during the address<br>and. pronouncing of the sentence.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <p>Edinburgh, Printed, for James Doghety, Price One Penny.<p></p>
