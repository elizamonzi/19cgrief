	<p> The CAT out  of the  <p>Pock!&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  <p> <p>A Full, True and Particular Account of a most<br>wonderful and astonishing Catastrophe that took<br>place a few evenings, in a gentleman's house, in<br>Fettes Row, ner Stockbridge, Edinburgh, when<br>a Black Quadruped of the feline species abso-<br>lutely swallowed a Paper,containing many popular<br>and learned Essays and dissertations on various<br>Subjects, too numerous to insert in our small<br>limits....but which must be very interesting to<br>all  our readers.<p> ('Extractedfrom the New North Brston.)<p>THE penchant of some of the lower animals<br> for articles of human utility is a well-kikown<br>fact in natural history. Rats have been known<br>to line their Bests with guinea notes, and mag-<br>pies to carpet their clay nests with cambric hand-<br>kerchiefs, as well as plenish their habitations with<br>silver and other articles, as is established by many<br>facts  on record, particularly, by that beautiful<br>French story, on which is founded the much-ad-<br>mired melo-drama, often represented on our stage,<br>called, ' The Maid and the Magpie.' A clergy-<br>man, not many miles from Edinburgh, had a<br>voracious cow that are a pair of  blankets and a<br>pair of boots during the time the family were<br>taking their dinner ; but the following CAT-as-<br>trophe is, we believe, the first instance of the fe-<br>line race having manifested any thing like a li-<br>tefiiry appetite.<p>.A gentleman in Fettes Row, near Stockbridge,<br>Edinburgh, who reads the Stirling Advertiser, had<br>that journal laid on his table at six o'clock the<br>other evening, and on returning home a few hours<br>afterwards, he found it reduced to tatters, and a<br>handsome black cat in the act of munching up the<br>fragments that were left. Puss had commenced <p>operations on the cover, which she had devoured<br>entirely. Next she had fallen on the Dean of Fa-<br>culty's interesting speech in the General Assem-<br>bly, on the Stirling Church case, and eaten out<br>the whole of the learned gentleman's preamble and<br>peroration, to show she did not proceed to ex-<br>tremities." A paragraph from the Court Journal,<br>stating, that the King had experienced a decided<br>relapse, and that the public might place implicit<br>reliance on their information, was devoured, from<br>which-we would-gladly augur- his Majesty's ul-<br>timate recovery. Several melancholy accidents had<br>only a dismal blank to tell the tale. On the first<br>page, two steam-boats, the ' fine coppered brig<br>Gleniffer',  and Warren's boots marked 30, Strand,<br>  were  nearly&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;all&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;that  had escaped ; but whether<br> this was owing to the appearance of the water, to<br>which cats have an instinctive dislike, or to the<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; terror inspired  by the portrait of the razor in the<br>  hand of the  man shaving in the other, we cannot<br>say.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We deem, the whole  a  curious  trait in the<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;history of that animal, the CAT !&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
