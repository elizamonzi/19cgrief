I'm sore afraid that you did me betray,<br>My virgin bloom you've got too soon by the dawning of the day.<p>I kissed my love at parting then crossed o'er the plain.<br>And in the course of seven months I met my love there again.<br>She seemed to be dropsical as she tripped o er the lea,<br>And carelessly I passed her by at the noontime of the day.<p>The tears ran down her rosy cheeks, and bitterly she cried.<br>She said, young man, I think it is time that I was made your<br>bride,<br>I pray make good the damage done, as yon before did say.<br>And don t forget the time we met by the dawning of the day.<p>I said fair lovely damsel. I hope you'll me excuse,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  -<br>To join with you in wedlock's bands indeed I must refuse,<br>For I lately have been married to a maid near Pantry Bay.<br>With whom I got three hundred pounds by the dawning of the<br>day.<p>This sadden blunt refusal did not with her agree.<br>She said you'll gain no credit in thus deluding me,<br>Now I may be a warning piece to other maidens gay.<br>Never to leave their parent's home by the dawning of the day.<p>Printed and Sold by JAMES LINDSAY, Stationer. &c, 9 King St.,<br>(off Trongate,) Glasgow.
