	<p> A WARNING<p>To the public; being a lamenable instance<br>of gronudless Suspicion.<p>An account of the melancholy death of Mary<br> M'Intyre, a young woman of respectable character<br>who being innocently accused of finding and<br>keeping up four £5 notes belonging to her mas-<br>ter a Manufacturer in Paisley. Giving an ac-<br>count in the manner in which he threatened her<br>with Bridewell, and giving her over to the Super-<br>tendent of Police; which acted so powerfully on<br>her mind, aided with all the horrors of an injured<br>character?she went and hanged herself.<p>With a copy of a letter which was found in the<br>room with her directed to her master.<p>ON the evening of Friday last, (22d February, 1822,)<br>Manufacturer in Paisley, having received four L5. notes<br>in payment of an account, deposited the same in one of his<br>breeches pockets. On Saturday mid-day when intending to<br>use the money, he was astonished to find that it was missing.<br>He passed over that day in searching his own house not being<br>certain but that he had laid it somewhere and forgot it. On<br>the Monday he made the town-crier proclaim it as money lost,<br>offering a reward of Five Pounds for its recovery; but as no<br>notice was got, he on the Tuesday made a general charge on<br>some female workers whom he employs in his house; and af-<br>terwards selecting one, made a direct charge on her of having<br>stolen the mony. His threats only produced strong assertion of<br>her innocence; and his suspiction remaining, he caused Mr<br>Brown, captain of she police to make her prisner, expecting that<br>his presance might have more effect than his own in making her<br>produce the mony. But, as she still denied having any knowledge<br>of the transaction she was dragged away from his house,and told<br>that she going to Bridewell. This operated so strongly on her<br>feelings that she promised, (though still asserting her innocence,<br>to allow her master to lift a legacy of £.10. which was due in<br>a few days, rather than affront her so?seeing her marriage was<br>only delayed till this money was due. On this condition she<br>was allowed her liberty, but the affront was more than she could<br>bear?her character broken?the means;of accomplishing her<br>marriage taken from her,?she went sraight home, and having<br>secured the door, suspended herself  from the ceiling by the silk<br>handkerchief which she was wearing On the arrival of her<br>female companion, who occupied the room with her, no ad-<br>mittance could be had; she searched for her till late then after-<br>wards procured another bed. On the morning she caused a per-<br>son to enter by the, window, when the corpse was discovered<br>Every humane mind must deplore the sad catastrophe.<p>in the room was found a  letter directed to her master. of<br>which the following is a Copy:?<br>' Dear Master,<p> "When you read this, poor Mary will be<br>beyond the reach of a Bridewell, and freed from the charge of<br>theft, when you read this, I will be immortal, I freely forgive you<br>and hope God will, no more from&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;your unfortunate,<p>Mary M'Intyre.'<p>This young woman was only 20 years of age, and <br> a native of  Argyleshire, was come of respectable parents, tho<br>poor. -She left them when she was about 14, and went to pais-<br>ley, where she was loved for strict virtue and  honesty. Her<br>employer thought by frightening  her, as she was of a simple<br>nature, that she would inform if she new any thing of it.</p>
