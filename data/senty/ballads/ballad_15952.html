	<p> An Accounts of the Comical Courtship between a Fishwife and a<br>Haddie Carter, shewing what past while in the Steam-Boat<br>between Newhaven and Musselburgh, and what happened after<br>landing, how she went to see the shows, and what the Black<br>Art Man told her, which was the beginning of her troubles, and<br>the desperate Battle which was fought betwixt some fishwifes<br>and her, on the Race course, with an account of a trick played<br>her, and other awful misfortunes.<p>THE following ludicrious scene<br>happened at Musselburgh Races<br>which can be given credit to, as it<br>is written by an eye witness, who<br>made one of the gay throng. Peggy<br>???, a weel kend fish-winch,<br>wha daily sits in the market, except<br>at times when her fish rins the dan-<br>ger of being coudemed to the mid-<br>den by the inspectors, then she is<br>seen traversing the streets giving<br>them the apellation of 'Caller Had-<br>dies." She is about 26 years of age,<br>never has been married, but ill-mind-<br>ed foaks say, that she some time a-<br>go, while disturbing the town's foaks<br>in some of the months of the year<br>that has an R in them, with the dis-<br>agreeable cry of  Whe'll buy Oysts'<br>she had the misfourtune to tak a wee<br>drappy past her guage oure muckle,<br>and met in wi' a daft chield on the<br>road as she gaed hame. As the road<br>was Jang and wearisome a body's lace<br>and it very Jate, Peggy was unco<br>fain wi' the kind words the chield<br>spake to her, and was happy to get<br>sac guid a convey : away they set,<br>but  what befel them, or what they<br>were about on the road, they ken<br>best themsels, but what passed in the<br>dark naebody saw, and it was far<br>gane in the morning before she got<br>name; in a wee while Peggy got<br>unco fat, or elslins she put twa-three<br>mair petticoats about her hurdiess,<br>be that as it may, she went across<br>the water to get cured of a dropsey,<br>and some ill-tongued jades said it<br>was to ly-in, but which o' the twa<br>I'se no pretend to ken, for she soon<br>came hame again quite cured. At<br>this time she got the preference at<br>ane o' the haddie carts, she being a<br>smart good looking kimmer, and<br>Sawny, the carter, taking a notion o'<br>her, he made her count out the fish<br>to the rest of her sisterhood, who<br>seeing Peggy sae much in power,<br>did na ken what was ill enough to<br>say about her; but, at any rate, the<br>bastard brat was cast up to her fifty<br>times a-day; this didna hinder Sawny<br>from liking her, for she made him<br>believe it was spite to her.<p> At this time Musselburgh Races<br>was drawing apace, and Sawny was<br>to tak Peggy to see them, he thought<br>on asking his master for a cart and<br>horse to gie her a ride out, but he was<br>afraid the fishwives in Musselburgh<br>wad rise a mob about them, for they<br>did na Iike her aweel I wat, and<br>ca'd her a' the limmers for takin awa<br>the callan, poor thing, just to fether<br>some mair o' her bastards ; and his<br>ears rang ilka morn wi' stories made<br>up about her, by the wives who had<br>tappies o' daughters at hame ; Sawny<br>thought it Was best to sail down in<br>the Steam-boat, which was taking<br>passengers from Newhaven to Mus-<br>selburgh. On board they went, and<br>got a snug corner to themsels, Sawny<br>thought this was a bra time to court<br>her, but. bashfu lad he coldna dae<br>naething but look at her, indeed she<br>is a sturdy wench, for there nane in<br>a' the place coud lay curpen to creel<br>wi' her, the fint a fellow in a' the<br>place but she wad a laid on the<br>breadth o' his back, and had a pair<br>o'&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;cheeks like&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a packman's doup ;<p>he was cunning eneugh, however. to<br>ack her if she had any gear gathered<br>thegether, but she tald him plump<br>down the gill stoup swallowed a' her<br>savings, and he had got share o'<br>money a ane, ' so thou's get nae<br>mair tocher than gammon to gam-<br>mon, blankets and sheets, twa cods,<br>a ca'f bed and bowsters, wi' a auld<br>and a new creel. This didna please<br>Sawny oure wee], but he coud<br>na draw back. and Peggy began to<br>speer Whan the wedding was to tak<br>place, aweel says Sawny I'll venture<br>to tak ye, but ye maun tell me if<br>the chield that gaed hame wi' ye frac<br>Edinborough ever briddled ye, or<br>taen a trying trotty o' ye, she assur-<br>ed him o' the contrary. They then<br>landed, and awa to the links they<br>gaed, taking a' the bye-paths for<br>fear o' being seen by some o' their<br>gude friends o' the town ; they did-<br>na mind the horses rinning muckle,<br>but ay kept about the Show., and<br>the up-aud-down things, which peg-<br>gy wada liked to hae taen a ride in,<br>but was feard the weans wad laugh<br>at her. After getting a glass or twa<br>(in some of Which a queer chap',<br>who was ane o" the company, put<br>a groat's worth o' the tincture o<br>-allup.) they set off to see a man<br>dealing in the Black Art, wi' cards,<br>siller, and sic like, but waes me, this<br>was the beginning of Peggys trou-<br>bles, for the man said, he wad find<br>out wha was married, and wha was-<br>na ; and wha had weans, and wha<br>hadna weans. So he showed them<br>some of his hocus pocus tricks, and<br>strange to tell, teld Peggy she had<br>haen a wean, and wad hae anither<br>before lang! how the Black Art body<br>kend that, nae body coud gues, but<br>any body that coud see as far into a<br>whin stane as mason, coud hae<br>guesed she wad hae anither soon,<br>but Sawny never suspected any thing<br>of the kind, poor man, he didna ken<br>far to look ; and as bad luck wad<br>hae it, there were some of the Mus-<br>selburgh fish-wives in the show, and<br>they werna lang in  telling a Peggys<br>fauts. Peggy condna stand this,<br>but flew at them, then what a noise !<br>the showman cursing, mutches and<br>hair fleeing, noses gushing wi' bluid,<br>and wives squalling, amidst hundreds<br>o" foaks laughing and halooing, but<br>faith Peggy got about a'dozen o them<br>down amang her feet, but waes me,<br>wi the heat of fighting, the jallup<br>began to rumble,'and ma conscience;<br>a' that Peggy coud do, she coudna<br>keep it within bounds, and just at<br>the time she was standing triumph-<br>ant on the tap o' them she had sae<br>gloriously got the better o', Out the<br>effects o' the purging burst, amidst<br>repeated shouts o' the mob. Peggy,<br>wi grief and shame sprang out frae<br>amang the mob, and no ane coud<br>lay saut on her tail. The poor fish-<br>bodys, wi" their braws a bespattered<br>made the best o' their way hame wi'<br>hundred ahint laughing; and Sawny<br>poor callan, made affat the beginning<br>o' the hurley-burley, and I trow has<br>heard enough about Pegggy to mak<br>him determined never to see her<br>again.<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Price One Penny.</p>
