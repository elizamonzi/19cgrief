	<h2>Transcription</h2>
	<p> This is a particular Account, founded on fact,<br>of  two young rovin' youths, who courted<br>Lasses for cake an' puddin'.<p>You now do see, as well as I<br>These twa young wanton sluts;<br>Who've taken in these hungry fellow,<br>To fill their empty guts.<p>The following story is a particular account of<br>Davy Bodkin, a Spail-licker, and his cousin Sandy<br>Speck, an Apprentice Baker, that formed an inti-<br>macy with two Lasses, that were servants to a Re-<br>verend Gentleman in this Town.<p>One night, when the fore-mentioned were filling<br>their bellies wi' some cauld meat, &c., Sandy says<br>t' Katie, O bring me a drink o' water, woman ! A<br>drink o' water, says Katie, I'll gie ye a drink o' beer;<br>an' then goes t' the pantry for it; Sandy goes after<br>'er t' get something more than the beer, leaving<br>Davy an' Tibby at the kitchen fire-side guzzling ; as<br>soon as the pantry door opened, it made a cheep, an*<br>the Mistress heard it, an* came down stairs ; an' as<br>soon as Katie heard 'er comin', she came immediately<br>out and shut Sandy in, so that he might not be seen,<br>an" ran into the kitchen, saying, G?d's mercy there's<br>Lucky comin'! Davy up an' pops into a shower<br>bath that was behind 'im, t' screen 'im frae Lucky,<br>as he knew she was a perfect scold, (as is generally<br>the case wi' Ministers' wives,) an' would allow no<br>man whatever t' come t' 'er house after ' er servents,<br>particularly late at night. As Lucky saw nothing,<br>she said nothin', but went, accordin' t' custom, an'<br>locked the door, carried off the key, an' ordered the<br>servants up stairs t' family worship. They were no<br>sooner began with prayer, than the string of the bath<br>gave way, which made the water come down on<br>Davy, an' drenched 'im as if he had been i' the sea.<br>When Davy felt the&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-ome upon ' m, he im-<br>mediately strove t' get out, but or e'er he got out,<br>o'er clashed the shower bath wi' the  door undermost,<p>which kept ' im in as if it were a mouse in a trap,<br>till prayers were done*. When Tibby got down<br>stairs an relieved 'im out of his prison, he had t'<br>dreep the parlour window e'er he could get out o'<br>the house,' an' when he was quitting his grip, he saw<br>a great light which frightened ' im, an' out bawled a<br>policeman Half-past twel', which frightened Davy the<br>more, which made 'im creep in below the area stair<br>t' shelter 'im frae bein' seen by the policeman, for<br>he knew if he were seen, he should be apprehended<br>for house-breaking, an' there he lay for more than<br>an hour, for the said watchman an' a Midden-Mavis?<br>had a long crack at the area door. When they went<br>awa', Davy got up t' the Street an' looked if he could<br>see  'is frien ' sandy ,an' whisteld, a-row,a-row,a-row,<br>a-row, a-row ; but na', Sandy was nae t' be seen nor<br>heard of; therefore, Davy had t' stap awa' hame<br>'imsel'.<p>The Baker lad, poor fallow, was kept prisoner i'<br>the pantry till twenty minutes past nine next morn-<br>ing, as Katie neglected t' tell Tibby she had put 'im<br>in, owing t' ane o' the bairns that had tane a tout.<p>Owing t the forementioned circumstance, viz:?<br>Davy lyin' all wet so long in a cold frosty night, and<br>Sandy standin' at the lack o' the pantry door, they<br>caught a cold which caused them t' be confined t' bed<br>for upwards of three months; an' they are now both<br>resolved they will never go in or out of any person's<br>window, nor keep correspondence with these Lasses,<br>or any other, if they are not at liberty t' gang wi'<br>freedom.<p>' It is lamentable to think, that while the Reverend Gentleman, &c. were at their devotion in one part<br>of the house, Davy was cursing like a heathen in the other.<br>? One who rakes the middens, &c.<p>As the Editor of this Story intends to issue several pieces of composition, both in prose and verse, he<br>begs leave to request, any person who has an entertaining piece by them, (that is no way immoral or<br>offensive, ) that they have a mind to publish, that if they will remit their piece to him, and if he ap-<br>prove of it, he will Edit it with a beautiful engraving, from designs made expressly for the work, and<br>they will receive a few copies as soon as it comes from the press.<p>N.B?Should the piece extend to more than what a baw-bet hand-bill will contain, it will be inserted<br>into one of the numbers of the Edinbury Gleaner.<p>* Though new in my projects, I would not offend<br>That person who shows himself to be a friend ;<br>But I will rebuff all that gives me alarm,<br>Or that which may prove Calcdonia's harm.<p>Published by W. SMITH, No. 3, Bristo Port.</p>
