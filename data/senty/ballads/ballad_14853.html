	<p> Burning of the Montreal,<p>and loss of Three Hundred<p>Scotch Emigrants.<p>Tune?' Flowers of the Forest.''<p>You people of Scotland I pray give attention,<br>A sad dismal story I goon shall let you hear,<br>Of the dreadful burning of the Steam-ship the Mon'real<br>For Montreal in Canada her course she did steer.<br>On the 26th of June at four o'clock that afternoon,<br>We sailed from Quebec so gallant and brave,<br>With nearly six hundred of a crew a passengers,<br>Now three hundred and odds they do he in their graves;<p>Many parted with joy upon that fatal  Afternoon,<br>With friends they loved dearly that cross'd o'er the main<br>Oh, little thought they of the danger before them,<br>Or that they should d ne'er see each other again.<br>When the Montreal had  reached about 12 miles from<br>Quebec,<br>Mr Hayes at this time came outside the Saloon,<br>He observed the smoke in columns  arising.<br>And used every exertion the Emigrants to save,<p>'Twas dreadful to hear the cries of women and children,<br>Clinging to husbands and parents, nearly scrorched to<br>death,<br>Now who can describe their sad situation,<br>As the Montreal was burning to tho water's edge.<br>Now nearly heart broken is poor Mr Milne,<br>For the fate of his wife and fivechildren so dear,<br>Through the town of Montreal he wanders distracted,<br>And oft on his cheeks seen the salt briney tear.<p>The fate of John Campbell his wife and his children,<br>O'er the town of Paisley has cast a sad gloom,<br>O little thought they when they sailed with the Montreal<br>And near to Cape Rouge for to meet a watery grave,<br>There is also Robert Wilson in the new town of Paisley,<br>With his wife and young child, and two friends so dear,<br>Were lost in the Montreal on that fatal afternoon,<br>They will long be lamented with many a tear.<p>Now many a widow is left broken hearted,<br>And many a orphan for their parents does mourn,<br>With tears in their eyes their fate will be lamented,<br>Who were both burned and drownded on that afternoon,<br>I  would have you consider before that you venture,<br>Or entrust your lives on the merciless wave,<br>O think on the Montreal with six hundred passengers,<br>Now nearly three hundred does lie in their grave,</p>
