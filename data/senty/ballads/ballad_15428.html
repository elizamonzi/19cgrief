	<p> Minerva of Leith !<p><p>A Full and Particular Account of the Loss of the Brig<br>Minerva of Leith, belonging to Messrs Stenhouse,<br>bound from Dublin to Glasgow, with Grain, which<br>violently Struck on the Horse Island, off Ardrossan,<br>Ayrshire,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;on&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tuesday&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Morning&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;18th&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;December<br>1821, by which one of the Crew, Peter Porter, and<br>Three Passengers, were unfortunately Drowned ;<br>also, an Account of the Ingenious manner by<br>which the Master, Charles Gibbon, a Seaman, Mar-<br>tin Horn, and a Young Lad, John Campbell,<br>were Providentially Saved, with the Names, &c.<br>of those who were Drowned !<p>ON  Tuesday the 18th December 1821, the people of Ardrossan,<br>and the surrounding country, were thrown into much con-<br>fusion and painful feeling, by the loss of the brig Minerva of Leith,<br>she property of Messrs Stenhouse there, bound from Dublin to<br>Glasgow, with upwards of 70 tons of grain. About six o'clock in<br>the morning, the wind blowing very strong from the south, and<br>the sea running excessively high, she struck upon the Horse Island,<br>about a mile off the coast of Ardrossan. As soon as she was<br>observed from the shore, a pilot, with the Eglinton life-boat, and<br>ten men, immediately went to her assistance. On account of the<br>very high wind, and the tremendous breakers by which they were<br>assailed, they found it impossible to approach the wreck ; and but<br>for the ingenious suggestion of Alexander Reid, of the Mary Anne<br>of Irvine, to carry a fishing-boat across the Island, to which it was<br>moored, they could not have got to the wreck at all.<p>When they did approach it, it consisted of nothing but a rafter<br>or spars and deals, providentially kept together by the entangle-<br>ment of the sails and cordage ; and from this, where they had re-<br>mained four hours, they happily succeeded in rescuing from a<br>watery grave, though much exhausted, Charles Gibbon, the master,<br>Martin Horn, a seaman, and John Campbell, a lad ; Peter Porter,<br>the other who completed the crew, was drowned,<p>It would be gratifying if this paragraph could be concluded,<br>however serious the loss may be to the owners, by saying that the<br>vessel was a perfect wreck, and that the cargo was completely lost.<br>But, alas ! four other lives were lost ; one man, said to be a private,<br>Robert Clark, of the 78th regiment, who had purchased his discharge,<br>and was on his way home somewhere in Aberdeenshire, who slept<br>in the forecastle, was doomed to instant death the moment the vessel<br>struck. A woman, whose name is said to be Maddin, and who was<br>on her way to join her husband, about twenty miles from Glasgow,<br>with a fine child, a boy about three years old, also perished. Mrs<br>Ord, of the Dublin Circus, where she had left her husband, and<br>was proceeding to Glasgow on business, was the other sufferer.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  <br>It must have been a heart-rending sight to see these poor creatures<br>sitting upon the deek, almost naked, and where they remained about<br>two hours contemplating their approaching fate! Maddin clinging<br>with one hand, and grasping her beloved child in her other arm to<br>her breast, till one tremendous effort of the raging ocean swept the<br>whole three into the immense abyss ! The Earl of Glasgow (whose<br>name must ever be coupled with all that is good as well as great)<br>kindly desired that every attention should be paid to the survivors,<br>who are comfortably put up at the Ardrossan Hotel ; and that every<br>were should be saken to prevent any smail remains of the vessel<br>from being plundered.<p>A female body has since been brought ashore, and from some pa-<br>pers found on her person, bearing the address of " Mrs Ord, No. 9.<br>Charlotte lane, Glasgow," it is persumed there is no mistake as to<br>the individual. A small Box containing the Master's papers has<br>also been found.-?"Ayr Advertiser."<p>PRICE ONE PENNY.</p>
