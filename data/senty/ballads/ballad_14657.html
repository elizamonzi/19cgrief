	<p> Horrible Shipwreck !<p>A Full, True and Particular Account of the Melancholy Loss of the British Convict Ship AMPHI-<br>TRITE, on the evening of Saturday last, the 31st August, 1833, off Boulogne, when 108 Female<br>Convicts, 12 Children, and 13 Seamen met with a watery grave, in sight of thousands, none<br>being saved out of 136 Souls but Three !?Taken from this day's Observer.<p>BOULOGNE-SUR-MER, 1st Sep. 1833.?<p>The horrible event which is announced<br>by the title to this letter has, I assure<br>you, filled the town with dismay, and<br>must lead to a most narrow and rigid<br>investigation.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I cannot attempt to de-<br>scribe the affliction not only of the En-<br>glish, but the French, at this most dis-<br>tressing event, and I only express the<br>general opinion when I say that  the<br>British public demands that an inquiry<br>be instituted&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;into the&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;conduct of all<br>parties concerned in this deplorable af-<br>fair.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Amphitrite convict ship sail-<br>ed for New South Wales from Wool-<br>wich on the 25th August (this day week.)<br>Captain  Hunter was  the commander ;<br>Mr Forester, the  surgeon;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and there<br>were 108 female convicts, 12 children,<br>and a crew of 16 persons.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The captain<br>was part owner of the vessel.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When<br>the ship arrived off Dungeness, the gale<br>of the 29th began.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On Friday morning,<br>the captain hove the ship to, the gale be-<br>ing too heavy to sail.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The vessel was a-<br>bout three miles to the east from Bou-<br>logne harbour on Saturday at noon, when<br>they made land.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The captain&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;set the<br>topsail and mainsail, in hopes of keep-<br>ing her off shore.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; From 3 o'clock she<br>was in sight off Boulogne, and certainly<br>the sea was most heavy and  the  wind<br>extremely  strong ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but no pilot boat<br>went out to her, and no life boats  or<br>other assistance were despatched.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I ob-<br>served her from 3 o'clock till half-past 4<br>in the afternoon, when she came round<br>into Boulogne harbour and struck on<br>sands.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; By 4 o'clock it was  known  to<br>be a British ship ; but some said it was<br>a brig, others said it was a  merchant<br>vessel, though all said it was  English.<br>It appears that three men who have been<br>saved out of the crew?all the rest hav-<br>ing perished?that the captain ordered<br>the anchor to be let go, in hopes of<br>swinging round with the tide.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a few<br>minutes after the  vessel  had gone a-<br>ground, multitudes rushed to the beach,<br>and a brave French sailor, named Pierre<br>Henin, who had already received the<br>thanks of the Humane Society of Lon-<br>don, addressed himself to the captain of<br>the port, and said he was resolved to go<br>alone, and to reach the vessel, in order<br>to tell the captain that he had not a mo-<br>ment to lose, but must, as it was low<br>water, send all his crew and passengers<br>on shore.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You will recollect, that up to<br>the time of her running aground, no<br>measure was adopted, and the captain<br>was not warned from shore of her dan-<br>ger.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As soon as she had struck, who-<br>ever, a pilot boat commanded by Fran-<br>cois Heuret, who had, on many occa-<br>sions, as pilot of your Standard's express<br>boats, shown much courage and talent,<br>was despatched, and by a little after 5<br>came under her bows. The captain of the<br>vessel refused to avail himself of the as-<br>sistance of Heuret and his brave com-<br>panions, and when a portion of the crew<br>proposed going ashore the captain pre-<br>vented them.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Two of the men saved<br>stated they knew the boat was under<p>the bows, but the rest were below mak-<br>ing up their bundles. The crew then<br>could have got on shore, and all the un-<br>fortunate women and children. When<br>the French boat had gone, the surgeon<br>sent for Owen, one of the crew, and or-<br>dered him to get out the long-boat.?<br>This was about half-past 5. The sur-<br>geon discussed the matter with his wife<br>and the captain. They were afraid to al-<br>low the prisoners to go on shore. The<br>wife of the surgeon is said to have pro-<br>posed to leave the convicts there, and to<br>go on shore without them. In conse-<br>quence of this discussion, no long-boat<br>was sent out. Three of the convict wo-<br>men told Owen that they heard the sur-<br>geon persuade the captain not to accept<br>the assistance of the French boat, on ac-<br>count of the prisoners who were on<br>board. Let us now return to Pierre<br>Henin.<p>The French pilot-boat had been re-<br>fused by the surgeon and captain?the<br>long-boat had not been put out, through<br>a disscussion as to saving the convicts?<br>and it was now nearly 6 o'clock. At<br>that time Henin went to the beach?<br>stripped himself?took a line?swam<br>naked for three quarters of an hour or<br>an hour, and arrived at the vessel a little<br>after seven. On touching the right side<br>of the vessel, he hailed the crew, and<br>said, " Give me a line to conduct you<br>on land, or you are lost, as the sea is<br>coming in. " He spoke English plain<br>enough to be understood. He touched<br>the vessel and told them to speak to the<br>captain. They threw (that is, some of<br>the crew, but not the captain or surgeon)<br>two lines, one from the stern and the<br>other from the bow. The one from the<br>stern he could not seize?the one from<br>the bow he did. He then went towards<br>the shore, but the rope was stopped.<br>This was, it is believed, the act of the<br>surgeon and captain. He (Henin) then<br>swam back, and told them to give him<br>more rope to get on shore. The captain<br>and surgeon would not. They then<br>tried to haul him in, but his strength<br>failed, and he got on shore. You per-<br>ceive, then, that up to this moment also,<br>the same obstacle existed in the minds<br>of the captain and of the surgeon. They<br>did not dare, without authority, to land<br>the convicts, and rather than leave them<br>on board, or land them without such<br>authority, they perished with them. But<br>who could have given this authority ?<br>The British Consul is of course the re-<br>ply. Did he do so ? No. Why not ?<br>We shall see hereafter.<p>To return to the narrative of events.<br>The female convicts who were battened<br>down under the hatches, on the vessel<br>running aground, broke away the half<br>deck hatch, and frantic, rushed on the<br>deck. Of course they entreated the cap-<br>tain and surgeon to let them get ashore<br>in the long-boat, but they were not lis-<br>tened to, as the captain and surgeon did<br>not feel themselves authorised to liberate<br>prisoners committed to their care. About<br>seven o'clock the flood tide began, The<p><p>crew, seeing that there were no hopes,<br>clung to the rigging. The poor 108<br>women and 12 children remained on<br>deck, uttering the most piteous cries.<br>The vessel was about three quarters of a<br>mile English from shore, and no more.<br>Owen, one of the men saved, thinks that<br>the women remained on deck in this<br>state about an hour and a half! Owen<br>and four others were on the spars, and<br>thinks they remained there three quar-<br>ters of an hour ; but seeing no hope of<br>being saved, he took to swimming, and<br>was brought in a state of insensibility<br>to the hotel. Towsey, another man sav-<br>ed, was on a plank with the captain, he<br>asked who he was ? He said, " I am the<br>captain," but the next moment he was<br>gone. Rice, the third man, floated ashore<br>on a ladder. He was in the aft when<br>the other men took to the raft. When<br>the French pilot-boat rowed away, after<br>being rejected by the captain, he (Rice)<br>saw a man waving his hat on the beach,<br>and remarked to the captain that a gen-<br>tleman was waving to them to come on<br>shore. The captain turned away and<br>made no answer. At the moment the<br>women disappeared, the ship broke in<br>two. These are the facts of this awful<br>case. The French Marine Humane So-<br>ciety immediately placed hundreds of<br>men on the beach; and the office or<br>lodging being close to the shore, as soon<br>as the corpses were picked up they were<br>brought to the rooms, where I assisted<br>many of my countrymen in endeavour- <br>ing to restore them to life. Our efforts<br>were fruitless, except in the case of the<br>three men, Owen, Rice, and Towsey. I<br>never saw so many fine and beautiful<br>bodies in my life. Some of the women<br>were most perfectly made ; and French<br>and English wept together at such a<br>horrible loss of life in sight of?aye,<br>and even close to, the port and town.<br>Body after body has been brought in.<br>More than 60 have been found; they<br>will be buried to-morrow. But, alas !<br>after all our efforts only three lives are<br>saved out of 136 ! ! !<p>Sunday, 1 o'clock.?The wind is some-<br>what abated, though not much. The sea<br>is running mountains high. We have<br>begun a subscription for the three fel-<br>lows who survive?I think we must add,<br>and for the widows and orphans of the<br>rest of the crew who expired. I send<br>you a copy of what has been done al-<br>ready. An old and steady friend of the<br>Standard (Mr Hawes) is doing all he<br>can.<p>This day week there will be charity<br>sermons for the poor creatures living,<br>and for the widows and orphans of the<br>dead. A portion of the subscription<br>will be applied towards rewarding the<br>pilot Heuret and Pierre Henin, who<br>did all they could towards saving the<br>vessel. The subscription will be super-<br>intended by a committee to be named<br>by the mayor of the town from the sub-<br>scribers.<p>Menzies, Printer, Lawnmarket.</p>
