After a little,<br> time Wilson gave witness a shillings. desiring him to go into Vallance<br>shop and to buy first, one half pound of cheese and then another, and<br>otherwise to occupy the attention of the girl in the shop as long as<br>possible so as to prevent  her hearing whatever night be going on in<br>the back room. He did so; and when Robertson and Hamilton<p>came out they said they had only gotten a banknote which they<p>produced and gave to Wilson.?They then went to Mr  Kings, where<p>Robertson and Hamilton again went in,and where the witness again<p>performed the part of the drawing off the attention of the persons in the<p>shop while the theft libelled was accomplished -They next went to<br>Finlay's where all four went into the house Robertson and Hamilton<p>into one room and Wilson and witness into another. The robbery<p>there was effected by Robertson and Hamilton.? They went lastly to<br>the shop of Mr Bobertson, spirit dealer, Charlotte Street.

Three Men .Apprehendad ?So anxious<br>have the officers of the Crown in Edinburgh been that every possible,<br>inquiry should be made into the murder of Helon Mackenzie, that J.<br>F. Stoddart, Esq advocate, has been sent to Ross shire to superintend<br>renewed investigations<p>On Monday, this gentleman, accompanied by the Shoriff and Pro-<br>curator Fiscal, proceeded to Invergordon, where they still continue<br>taking precognitions. During the examination of some of the wit-<br>tnesses, circumstances were elicited which induced the authorities to,<br>order two men (one of them the deceased's nephew), residing at Bar-<br>baraville, near the Church of Kimuir. to be apprehended. In their<br>progress to Barbaraville, the officers observed a man run oft on seeing<br>them approach?they instantly pursued, and, with some difficulty,<br>succeeded in securing him; he proved to be the nephew of the decease.<br>ed?The officers then took into custody the two men, and also a shot-<br>maker, who resides about a hundred yards from the house which poor<br>Helen occupied. On Thursday they were taken in the mail coach<br>from Invergordon to Tain, and lodged in jail there, where they are<p>While on the coach, the prisoners were not permitted to bold any<br>communication with each other; one of them was placed in the forepart<br>of the coach, one behind, and the third inside. The shoemaker, Helen's<br>neighbour observed to a person sifting close by him, ' I am happy<br>that I have been apprehended, that the ease may be sifted ; for, as I<p>I am entirely innocent, and I know I will soon be set at liberty ; but<br>as for that man inside (meaning the deceased's nephew) he is the<br>murderer he has not been sober since A knife, the handle of<br>which is covered with blood, and a petticoat have been found, which it<p>One of the prisoners, on his first examination, we understand, stated<br>that he received no part of the deceased's property, but his wife con-<br>tradicted this, and mentioned that he had, some days after the murder,<br>taken L 14 out of Helen's house, and gave as a reason for doing so<br>that he was afraid others who have a better legal tittle to cash would<br>have carried it off. Some of the prisoners, it has been observed, have<br>had more money since the murder than they could honestly have come<br>by. A man and a woman, who were ordered to be taken into cus-<br>tody, left the district some weeks ago, hut are now, we learn, in Aber<br>deenshire, and will be brought back.<p>Murder at Sea.?On Friday an inquest was held in the Vestry of<br>St John's Church, Horseleydown, on the body of John Smith, aged<br>19 years, whose death, it was alleged, was caused by a series of the<br>most inhuman barbarities inflicted by Daniel Wilson, the Captain of<br>the Armenia trading vessel, during a voyage from Belfast to St.<br>Michael's, and from thence to London. The Jury viewed the body<br>which bore marks of contusion and laceration, particularly about the<br>loins. On quitting St Michael'., the Captain beat the deceased daily<br>about a week after they sailed from St. Michael's, the Captain beat him<br>with the stick of the vine staff, which is two inches and a half thick,<br>for taking some oranges ; the deceased was so ill, he could not do his<br>duty, and the Captain knocked him down and kicked him as be lay<br>on the ground<br>On one occasion he beat the deceased with an outall (a thick rope)<br>till his face streamed with blood, and his nose was slit open. The de-<br>ceased was sent to the fore top crosstress for fifteen. hours at a time<br>without his jacket, and his allowance kept from him. Four days be-<br>fore he died the Captain went into the forecastle; and beat the deceas.<br>ed about the head with  quart pot, and nearly a quart of blood came<br>from him- The deceased was often lashed to the main shrouds, and<br>the boys were ordered by the Captain to flog him, and when they<br>did not obey they were flogged. The deceased from continual nl-.<br>usage became deranged, and expired two days before the vessel ar-<br>rived at Gravesend. The Jury returned a verdict of.' Wilful Murder<br>against Daniel Wilson, the Captain of the Armenia.<p>The Funeral of Radama, King of Madagascar, which took place on<br>the 13th of August, 1828, appears, from the account of the mission-<br>aries in that pland, to have vied in splendour  and extravagance with<br>the most costly of European entombments . They estimate the ex-<br>pense at L. 60,000 sterling, including the case of 20,000 oxen, worth<br>Ave Spanish dollars each, killed and distributed among the people<br>during the days of preparation for, and at the ceremony, The large<br>and massy coffin which received the royal remains was of beaten sil-<br>ver ; it was about eight feet long, and three and a half deep, formed<br>of plates strongly rivetted together with nails of the same metal, all<br>made from Spanish dollars, of which twelve thousand were employed<br>at  the construction. Ten thousand more in specie were placed in-<br>side by way of bed for the corpse to recline on. Eighty rich suits of<br>uniform, of British manufacture, a golden helmet, gorget, epaulettes',<br>and spurs, with a variety of valuable and highly ornamented arms,<br>watches, rings, and trinkets, a splendid service of silver plate, and <br>magnificent cup of solid gold, said la have been a present from the<br>King of England, are enumerated strong the valuable  enclosed in  the<br>royal tomb.<p>Extravagant as these people are in the expense they incur  their<br>funerals, this appears to have tar exceeded all preceding ceremonies<br>the same kind m that respect, which may be accounted for by the fact<br>of no sovereign in that country having ever died possessed of one-fifth<br>of the riches of Radama.<p><p>FORBES & OWEN Printers No.118,High Street First stair in the Close.<p></p>
