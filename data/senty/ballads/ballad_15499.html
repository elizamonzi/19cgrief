	<p> EXECUTION.<p>An Account of the Execution of John<br>Stuart and Catherine Wright his<br>Wife, for the  Murder of Robert<br>Lamont, by poison, on board of the<br>Toward Castle Steam Boat.<p> Wednesday, Aug. 19, John Stuart, and Catherine Wright attoned<br>for their atrocious crimes on the scaffold. With the exception<br>of Burke, no criminal has excited so much public detestation as the<br>hardened villain of whom justice has now ridded society. The fate<br>of the woman, though in a legal point of view, was equally criminal<br>with her husband, has excited comparatively a degree of compas-<br>sion in the breasts of those acquainted with the circumstances in<br>which she had all along been placed with regard to Stuart. At-<br>tached to him in an infatuated degree, she suffered every kind of<br>abuse at his hands; and yet she continued to aet as his coadjutor,<br>and to serve him as faithfully as if he had behaved to her with in-<br>cessant kindness. Stuart, previous to his trial, in conjunction<br>with the criminals amongst whom he mixed in the prison, planned,<br>and had actually commenced operations, by which he expected to<br>effect his escape. His intention was to murder the turnkey who<br>wasin immediate attendance, and, after perpetrating this atrocity,to<p>kill Mr Fisher, the lieutenant governor of the jail, in whose pos-<br>session are the keys of the principel entrance. Luokily the scheme<br>was discovered in time to counteract the daring operations of the<br>prisoner.<p>Since they received sentence of death they have been regularly<br>visited by the Rev. Dr Gordon and the Rev. Mr Porteous, chaplain<br>to the prison, who have been unwearied in their administrations of<br>religious instruction and consolation. They paid most implicit at-<br>tention to the advices and admonitions of their spiritual instructors,<br>they conversed freely on the wickedness and enormity of their past<br>lives, and they deeply deplored their disregard of industry and mo-<br>rality, and their utter neglect of the holy precepts of the Gospel,<br>which alone can insure comfort, prosperity, and respectability  on<br>this earth, and eternal felicity in the world to come.<p>At the suggestion of the ministers, they were daily brought to-<br>gether for a short time to hear the same exhortations, and they were-<br>inspired with the same grounds of hope. They spent most of their<br>time in reading the Bible and such religions books as were allowed<br>them by the minsters, and they were by no means so brutishly igno-<br>rant as they might be supposed to be from the enormity, of their<br>crimes.<p>The unhappy criminals slept little during Tuesday night in the<br>Lock-up-house, (being previously brought from the  Salton hill Jail,<br>when, upon parting with the humane Governor and Turnkeys who<br>had them under their charge, they expressed their utmost gratitude<br>for the humanity and kindness with which they were treated by<br>them.) In the morning as soon as the Clergymen were announced,<br>they left their cells, and entered immediately and to appearance<br>seemingly anxiously, into conversation with these worthy men, who<br>during their confinement in the Jail, were unwearied in their pious.<br>endeavours to bring them to a sense of the awful situation in which<br>they were placed; and we are happy to say trial their exertions<br>were crowned with success, for their last moments were solely taken<br>up with enquiries after their future prospects; this alone oceupied<br>their thoughts, while the preparations were making for their final<br>exit,?no earthly ideas seemed at this time to engross their atten-<br>tion. When the magistrates were announced, the executioner<br>prepared to pinion their arms;?Stuart submitted with a degree of<br>calm fortitude, but his frail companion shewed some signs of faint-<br>ness at this doleful ceremony. At a few minutes after eight they<br>left the Lock-up-house, and proceeded by Libberton's wynd to the<br>scaffold, which was strongly guarded by a body of Police, and<br>around which, in a compact mass, were thousands, male and female,<br>anxiously waiting to see the last sentence of the law put into effect.<br>Prayers were offered up to Him, who alone is able to grant repent-<br>ance for manifold sins, and a psalm chosen for the awful occasion<br>was sung. They were then supported to the drop, and after shaking<br>hands, and offering up an inward prayer, Stuart dropt the signal,<br>and thus attoned for the awful crimes of which they were guilty.<p>John Stuart was 32 years of age, a native of Ireland, and a<br>Blacksmith by trade. He married Catherine Wright about six<br>years ago;?she was a native of Glasgow, and 22 years ages.<br>During; these six years, they have chiefly subsisted on the proceeds-<br>of their murderous and. diabolical resources.</p>
