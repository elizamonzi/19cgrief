Dunlop leaped out of the win-<br>dow and ran near a mile before he was apprehened.<p>Donald Frazer, police officer Glasgow searched Harmer's house in  August last,<br>where he found 4 unbleached, and 7 unbleached  pieces of muslin; witness also went<br>to Belfast where he apprehended Harmer, and brought him to Glasgow, along with<br>137 pieces of the muslins.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<p>James M'llroy, was in the service of Dunlop & Hun ter in Glasgow, last summer.<br>Dunlop, at his own house, opened hte pale for stealing the goods. The agreement<br>was, that witness was to steal the articles, and he would afterwards purchase<br>them from him. Cannot say how many pieces had been stolen. Went with him to<br>Hutch nson's manufactory for goods to be- singed. Witness held the bag into<br>which the pieces of muslin were put by Dunlop and Hunter and Dunlop were particu-<br>lar pieces put up in score for Hunter and Dunlop to take away in their turn. While<br>Hunter and Csrmichael held t he bag, Dunlop and witness put in the pieces, and<br>Dunlop and witness put in other pieces besides those which were laid aside for them.<br>Witness did so at Dunlop's desire, and was promised by him some money for a new<br>suit of clothes if he kept the circumstance secret. Witness was about three weeks<br>in the service, and this plan was laid the second night after he entered it. Does<br>not think that Hunter saw the pieces put into the bag which ought not to have been<br>put in. Witness was in the  practice of doing this every night; concealed it from<br>Hunter.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The bags were then taken to Dunlop's house by witness and  Hunter......<br>Dunlop and witness, after Hunter went away, tumbled out the goods, and those<br>stolen were kept separate by John Dunlop.  Got L,2: could not however say exact-<br>ly what he received.<p> John Carmichial (another accomplice) collaborated the above evidence, and as.<br>sisted in the commiss oh o the theft, for which he received L.1<p>Several other witnesses completely established the guilt of Dunlop and Hamer.<p>The Lord Justice Clerk charged the Jury, who after a short deliberat on returned&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>a verdict of Guilty, against Dunlop and Harmer; and Not Proven gainst Hunter,<br>who was therefore liberated from the bar.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The other prisoners, after ar, impressive <br>admonition from the Lord Justice Clerk, were sentenced  to be transported for 14<br>years.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The trial lasted till two o'clock on Tuesday morning.<p>John Muir, Printer, Glasgow.</p>
