	<p> Suicide of Wm. Pollock!<p>A Full True and Particular Account of the Suicide committed by<br>WILLIAM POLLOCK, in the Jail of Edinburgh, yester-<br>day morning, the 20th March 1826, who was condemned to<br>he Fxecuted here tomorrow (Wednesday the 22d current) for<br>the Murder of his own Wife; together with a copy of his<br>LETTER to Mr Young, Governor of the Jail, &c..<p>A Most extraordinary circumstance took place in the Jail of Edinburgh yes-<br>terday morning, Monday the 20th March 1826. Pollock, the man who<br>was under sentence of Death for the Murder of his Wife, and who was to have<br>suffered the last punishment of the law tomorrow morning, strangled himself in<br>his cell with a portion of his own shirt.<p>At eight o'clock, the upper turnkey visited Pollock, and cleaned his cell. The<br>prisoner then said he felt more easy, and in better spirits. When breakfast was<br>taken to him, about half past nine, he was found dead, but not quite cold. He<br>had torn out the. back of his shirt, and. a strip from the side of a blanket, and<br>these he twisted in the form of a small rope, and fastened to the cross-bar of a<br>table...a piece of wood about fifteen inches long, and a quarter of an inch<br>thick....which he had laid across the ventilator of his cell, a small circle of 18<br>inches diameter, formed in the wall, which separates the apartment from the<br>passage. The height of this ventilator is only 6 feet 4 inches or thereabouts,<br>from the floor of the cell, but between it and the floor is the bed, a thick oak<br>plank, on which the unhappy man lay, and likewise the gaud or iron bar to<br>which he was fastened. He had adjusted his bed-clothes, however, so as to en-<br>tangle his feet, and prevent them reaching the ground, when he threw himself<br>off. He had also drawn a rug between the gaud and the ring of his fetters, to<br>prevent noise. Indeed, the whole circumstances evinced a degree of determi-<br>nation and deliberation that is surprising.<p>Pollock left three letters, and a scrap of paper containing an inventory of his<br>effects in the jail ;?these he wished to be given to his son. The letters were<br>all of nearly the same tenor : in them he admits the guilt of suicide, but states<br>that he could not endure the thought of suffering on the scaffold for a crime he<br>" could not bring his mind to believe he was guilty of." To Mr Young, the<br>Governor, he writes,?" Excuse this rash act; when you consider all, you will<br>see there is good intentions, though not towards myself.'<p>Pollock has, throughout the whole course of his confinement, conducted him-<br>self very quietly, but always denied the murder, and appeared rather irritated when<br>taxed with it He has been attended by the Rev. Dr Lee since his condemnation.<p>Edinburgh :..,.Printed by J. CUMMING.....Price One Penny.</p>
