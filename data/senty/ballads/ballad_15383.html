	<p> CORRECT COPY, WITH FULL PARTICULARS.<p>DREADFUL<p>ACCIDENT, <p>AND <p>LOSS OF LIFE.<p>A Full, True, and Particular Account of that Dreadful  Accident<br>which occurred in this City on  Saturday afternoon, by the Fall-<br>ing in of a House in  Picardy Place,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;when  crowded with com-<br>pany of the first  respectability attending  the  sale of the late<br>Lord Eldon's  Pictures,-Giving the full particulars of that me-<br>lancholy catastrophe, with the names of the unfortunate sufferers.<p>The sale of the Paintings belonging to the late Lord Eldon was<br>resumed for the third day, at one o'clock on Saturday last, in the<br>back drawing-room, on the second flat, in his Lordship's house,<br>No. 16. Picardy Place; when a company of about 150 had assem-<br>bled, among whom were from 12 to 14 ladies. The sale was pro-<br>ceeding with great spirit, when, at about half past two, the greater<br>part of the floor instantaneously gave way, and precipitated the<br>company into the flat below.<p>Such was the suddenness of the catastrophe, that not even a<br>warning was given by the cracking of the upholding joists ; and the<br>first intimation that the company received of their danger, was<br>their consciousness of having commenced a descent.<p>The first intimation which the people on the street received,<br>was one or two gentlemen rushing out at the front door, with blood<br>on their faces and covered with dust The clouds of dust which<br>burst from the door and windows, made it appear as if the house<br>was on Fire. A crowd was quickly attracted to the spot, who, on<br>learning the melancholy catastrophe, immediately broke open the<br>room-door, and set about extricating the unfortunate sufferers,<br>many of whose clothes were torn to tatters, and so covered with<br>dust that their features could scarcely be recognised.<p>About eight or ten feet of the floor near the north window did<br>not go down, and several persons who were standing in that part of<br>the room escaped. Mr Winstanley, the auctioneer, on the first<br>symptom of the floor giving way, laid hold of the mantle-piece,<br>but lost his grasp, and fell down among the other sufferers. His<br>clerk was more fortunate; he had also clung to the mantle-piece,<br>and retained his hold till relieved by a ladder.<p>On removing a chest of drawers, Alexander Smith, Esq. banker,<br>was found lying below it. He was conveyed into the front room,<br>when it was observed he had received a severe contusion on the<br>forehead, and several medical gentlemen being present, they at-<br>tempted to bleed him, but life was extinct. It is supposed he had<br>gone down among the first, and that his death was caused by con-<br>cussion of the brain, occasioned either by a blow from the corner<br>of the hearth-stone, or from the end of one of the beams. No<br>other person received any fatal injury, but we learn that the fol-<br>lowing gentlemen were bruised  though, we are happy to state, all<br>doing well, viz. Lord Moncrieff slightly; Mr Sivewright of Meg-<br>getland, slightly ; Mr Marjoribanks of  Marjoribanks, slightly; Dr<br>Maclagan, injury in the knee ; George Thomson, Esq. Trustees<br>Office, very severe blow in the chest; W. S. Watson, Esq. severe-<br>ly injured ; J. F. Williams, Esq three of his ribs broke ; James<br>Lang, Esq. W.S., severely hurt; Mr Ross, junior, of Inverleith<br>Row, leg fractured and ancle dislocated ; Mr Lorimer, merchant,<br>Elm Row, severely injured ; Mr Stewart, of the Custom-house,<br>and Mr Wright, auctioneer, much hurt: and Mr Younie, severe-<br>ly bruised. Mrs Keay of Snaigow, slightly hurt; and Mrs John<br>Anderson, junior, South Bridge, severely injured. We understand<br>that, had it not been that the carpet of the room broke the fall, a<br>number of lives would have been lost.<p>The cause of the accident was the breaking of a large beam<br>which extended across the centre of the room, and supported the<br>flooring. It appears to have been insufficient from the first, and<br>had joined to it a piece of wood by means of an iron bolt and screw,<br>which only served still farther to weaken it, for the bolt passed<br>through a large knot in the wood, and thus the beam was liable to<br>give way whenever there was any great weight on the floor.</p>
