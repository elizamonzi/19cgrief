	<p> EXECUTION!<p>A Full and Particular Account of the Execution of JOHN WIL-<br>SON and DUNCAN FRASER, who were Executed at the<br>Head of Libberton Wynd, Edinburgh, on Wednesday morning<br>the 28th January, 1824, for Honsebreaking and Theft; with<br>a particular Account of their Behaviour since their Condemna-<br>tion and at the place of Execution.<p>THESE unfortunate young men, JOHN WILSON and DUNCAN FRA-<br> SER, were tried at Edinburgh, before the High Court of Justiciary, and<br>a respectable Jury, on Monday the 22d of December last, for Housebreaking<br>and Theft, aggravated by being habit and repute common Thieves. They were<br>charged with breaking into the Shop of Mr James Smyth, Tailor and Broker in<br>St. Mary's Wynd, Edinburgh, on the 8th of October last, and stealing therefrom<br>a great many articles of Wearing Apparel. To which charge they both pled<br>Guilty, though repeatedly cautioned by the Lord Advocate, as to the perilous<br>situation in which they stood, and the serious nature of the charge, upon which<br>a capital sentence must inevitably follow, it not being his intention to restrict<br>the libel to an arbitrary punishment. They adhered to their confession of<br>Guilty, however, which was recorded, and they were duly convicted in terms<br>thereof.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <p>The Lord .Justice Clerk, in pronouncing judgment said it was distress<br>observe, that she offence of housebreaking and theft should be persevered in by<br>persons arrived at the prisoners' age of maturity and discretion, notwithstand-<br>ing the examples which had been very recently made, in this very city, of indi-<br>viduals who had forfeited their lives to the violated laws of their country. It<br>was still more distressing to observe, that the prisoners belonged to a class of<br>offenders who laboured under the repute of being habitual thieves, and of hav-<br>ing been previously convicted of theft. Would to God that they had taken<br>warning from the example of their first conviction, and that the court had been<br>spared the pain of inflicting?that the prisoners had been thus happily rescued<br>from the dreadful necessity of suffering....and that their distressed relatives and<br>connexions had been saved the affliction of witnessing....the disgraceful punish-<br>ment of their guilt. His Lordship, under a very evident oppression of feeling,<br>proceeded. to state that he had that morning seen a letter from the father of the<br>prisoner, Wilson, which appeared to have been written under all the agony of<br>mind which a parent might be expected to feel on contemplating the present<br>disgraceful situation of his son. (This unfortunate lad's parent, we understand,<br>is now in a mad house of this city, having lost his reason on bearing the con-<br>demnation of his son.) His Lordship, after recommending the prisoners to<br>apply, without loss of time, to spiritual counsel and assistance, then read the<br>sentence of the Court, ordaining the prisoners to be Executed on Wednesday<br>the 28th January next, between the hours of eight and ten morning.<p>Accordingly, they were early on Tuesday removed to the Lock-up-House,<br>where they were waited on by several of their nearest relatious, and the separa-<br>tion from some of them was most appalling to the most hardened feelings. The<br>Clergy of the city, as well as the Chaplain of the Jail, and other good Christians<br>in town, were most attentive and most earnest for their religious instruction<br>and edification, which they repeatedly and sincerely rcknowledged.<p>They slept little or none on Tuesday evening, and the Clergyman and offi-<br>ciating Magistrates waited on them in the Hall of the Lock-up-House, a little<br>before Eight o'clock on Wednesday morning, when they joined most fervently<br>in the devotional supplications put up on that occasion. After which, their arms<br>were pinioned, and the melancholy procession moved up, in a slow and solemn<br>manner, to the head of Libberton Wynd, attended by a strong detachment of<br>Police Officers. They appeared on the scaffold, decently dressed, about half-<br>past eight o'clock, where a psalm was sung, in which they joined, and a most<p>impressive prayer put up for them to the throne of mercy, by one of the Cler-<p>gymen present ; during which they appeared most devout and attentive to what<br>was so eloquently urged in their behalf. Having taken a solemn farewell of<br>those around them, they mounted the fatal drop, with a little assistance, where<br>they appeared most fervent in prayerr, while the ropes were adjusting round<br>the beam. All things being prepared, and having taking farewell of each other,<br>they dropt the signal, and were launched into eternity about 9 o'clock.<p>Edinburgh, Printed for Alexander Turnbull.
