	<p> Trial and Sentence of David Haggart,<br>for the Murder of the Dumfries jailor<br>who is to be Executed at Edinburgh,<br>on Wednesday the 18th day of July<br>next.<p>THIS day, Monday June 11 th 1821, came on the Trial<br>of David Haggart,. before the High Court of Justiciary,<br>accused of Murder, upon the 10th day of October 1820, while<br>he was prisoner in the jail of Dumfries, on the body of Tho-<br>mas Morrin, the under jaiter or turnkey of said prison, with<br>a stone or some other instrument, whereby the skull was se-<br>verely fractured, and otherwise mortally wounded, in conse-<br>quence of which, he only languished for the space of eight<br>hours; and then did take the keys of the prison and effected<br>his escape.<p>Two declarations of the pannel were read, one emited on<br>the 2d day of May 1821, and the other on the llth of same<br>month, before Sir Thomas Kirkpatrick, sheriff depute, and<br>William Baillie, sheriff substitute, of Dumfries. Both of which,<br>declarations were proven in Court by the above Gentlemen.<p>Amongst the witnesses, were Thomas Hunter, keep-<br>er of the jail of Dumfries,?May Gullen wife of Thomas Hun-<br>ter... Sarah Gaze, servant to Thomas Hunter?Jannet Corrrie,<br>widow of the deceased Thomas Morren,?Robert Simpson,<br>prizoner in the Jail of Dumfries,?Archibald Blacklock surgeon<br>in Dumfries. 30 witnesses were cited in whole.<p>It appeared in the course of the evidence, that Haggart,<br>after breaking Leith jail, where he was lodged for the crime<br>of theft, was apprehended and lodged in the jail of Dumfries<br>and then on purpose to effect his escape, procured a stone,<br>which he put into a bag or stocking, and at a convenient time<br>when Thomas Morren, the under turnkey of Dumfries jail,<br>was in the act of locking up the prisoners, Haggart struck him.<br>a severe blow on the head with the stone and bag, which foun-<br>dered him ; he then repeated his blows, and fractured his skull<br>and mortally wounded him in other places, by which he died<br>in the course of eight hours afterwards. He then took the<br>keys of the prison and effected his escape, and sentence of fu-<br>gitation and outlawry was paonounced against him by the<br>High Court of justiciary, upon the 5th day of February 1821,<br>He was afterwards apprehended in Ireland for some other<br>crimes, and after breaking two prisons there, and under<br>sentence of transportation, he was recognized, and officers<br>sent from Dumfries to convey him hither. He was then sent<br>to Edinburgh, heavily ironed, on the 18th of May.<p>The prisoner did not appear much cast down. He appears<br>to be about 31 years of age, and of a tall Make.<p>The Lord justice Clerk addressed the prisoner in the most im-<br>pressive manner, which affected all present ; he dwelt on the<br>heinous crime of murder; and the other crimes which he had<br>been guilty of, for some time, and then warned him to beg<br>and apply for mercy at the throne of grace, as he could not<br>expect any here. He then pronounced' the awful sentence of<br>the law, which was, that he shall be Executed at Edinburgh,<br>on Wednesday the 18th of July next.</p>
