	<p> MURDER<p>Full, True, and Particular Account of that most Horrid Murder which was committed on New Year?s Morning, in Dunbar Street, Canal Basin Edinburgh, on the body of Mrs Calderhead with a correct account of the apprehension of the Murderers; with an account of that awful accident that happened on Saturday Morning, in Milne?s Court, Lawnmarket, when a woman was burned to death.<p>Saturday being New Year?s Day, it was ushered in with all those scenes of mirth and jollity usual upon such occasions in Scotland.  But a time of this kind rarely passes over, without some extraordinary incident occurring to mar the happiness and peace of some individual or family.<p>It is our painful duty to record an instance of the fatal effects of people going from house to house on New Year?s Morning, when they ought to have remained at home, and made themselves happy with their family, and thereby shewing a good example to the rising generation.<p>Murder is a crime of the greatest magnitude, the bare recital of which, at all times, fills the mind with horror.  The circumstances attending the commission of this Murder are of the most revolting description.<p>About four o?clock on New Year?s Morning, a most horrid and diabolical murder was perpetrated in a house in Dunbar Street, near the Canal Basin, Edinburgh. ? Mrs Calderhead, wife of Alexander Calderhead, both of whom gained an honest livli- by retailing potatoes through this town, and who bore a very respectable character, entered a company in good health and high spirits, and was carried out a corpse. Two men, brothers, are in custody, on suspicion of being the Murderers. The forehead of the unfortunate woman was cut and bruised, and in the abdomen, from the lower part upwards, there was a wound through an extent of about ten inches. Delicacy forbids us to be more explicit. The unfortunate woman has left a family of five children to deplore her untimely end. The case is under investigation.<p><br>A WOMAN BURNED TO DEATH, ON<br>NEW YEAR?S MORNING<p>On Saturday Morning an old woman in Milne?s Court, Lawnmarket, was found in her house, literally burned to a cinder. How the melancholy event took place is uncertain; but the remains of her body were discovered about 8 o?clock, on Saturday morning, by some individual who had called to see her.<p>John Campbell, Printer, Edinburgh.</p>
