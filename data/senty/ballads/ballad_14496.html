	<p> The Noble Man's Generous Kindness;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>Or the Country-Man's Unexpected Happiness.<p>Giving a True account of a Nobleman, who taking Notice of the poor Man's<br>Industrious Care and Pains for the maintaining of his Charge, which was Seven<br>small Children, meeting with him upon a day, Discoursed with him, and<br>invited him and his Wife, with his Children, home to his House; and<br>accordingly bestewed upon him a Farm of Thirty Aikers of Land, to be con-<br>tinued to him and his Heirs.<p>To an Excellent. New  Tune.<p><br>A NobleMan liv'd near a Village of late, <br>Hard by a poor Thresher whose Charge it was great;<br>He had seven Children and most of them small,<br>And none but his Labour to keep them withall,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<p>He never was given to idle and lurk,<br>This Noble Man seeing him go daily to work:<br>His Flail, with his Bag, and his Bottle of Beer,<br>As cheerfull as those that had hundreds a year.<p>Thus carefull and constant each morning he went<br>To his Daily Labour with Joy and Content,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  <br>So jocund and jolly, both whistle and sing,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  <br>As blith and as brisk as a Bird in the spring,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<p>One morning this Noble Man taking his Walk,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>He met with this poor Man, and freely did talk,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>He asked him many a Question at large,<br>Familiarly talking, concerning his Charge,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  <p>Thou haft many Children I very well know<br>Thy Labour is hard, and thy Wages is low,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>And yet thou art cheerful; I pray tell me true,<br>How you do maintain them so well as you do.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  <p>I carefully carry home all that I earn;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>Now daily experience by this I do learn;<br>That though it is possible we may live poor.<br>We still keep a ravenous Woof from the door.<p>I Read and I Mow, and I Harrow and Sow.<br>Sometimes I to Hedging and Ditching do go:<br>No Work come amiss for I Thresh and I Plow<br>Thus I eat my Bread by the sweat of my Brow.<p>My Wife she is willing to pull in Yoak,<br>We live like two Lambs, and we never provoke<br>Each other, but like to the labouring Ant<br>We do our endeavour to keep us from want.<p>And when I came home from my Labour at night<br>To my Wife and Children, in whom I delight,<br>To hear them come round me with tattling noise<br>Now these are the Riches that poor Men enjoy.<p>Though I am as weary as weary my be.<br>The youngest I commonly dance on my Knee.<br>I find that Content is an absolute Feast.<br>I never repin'd at my Charge in the least.<p>The Noble Man hearing then what he did say<br>Was pleas'd, and invited him home the next day:<br>His Wife and his Children he charg'd him to bring<br>in token of Favour, he gave him a Ring.<p>Then thanked his Honour; and taking his leave,<br>He went to his Wife, who would hardly believe;<br>But that this strange story himself he might raise,<br>Yet feeing the Ring she was then in a maze.<p>Be times in the morning the good Wife arose;<br>And made them all fine in the best of their cloaths<br>The good Man and Wife, with his Children small,<br>They then went to Dine at the Noble Mans Hall,<p>But when they come there, as the truth doth report<br>All things was prepar'd in a plentiful sort <br>And they at the Noblemans Table did Dine,<br>With all soats of Dainties, with plenty of Wine<p>All things being over, he soon let him know:<br>What he then intended on him to be slow:<br>A Farm, with full Thirty good Acres of Land,<br>And gave him the writings into his own hand<p>Because thou wast careful and good to thy Wife,<br>I'll make thy days happy the rest of thy life;<br>It shall be for ever to thee and thy Heirs:<br>For why, I beheld thy indsiurious Care.<p>No Tongue then was able in full to express,<br>The depth of their joy & their true thankfulness.<br>With many a Courtesie and Bow to the ground:<br>But like such Noble Men there is few to be found.<p>FINIS.</p>
