	<p> EXECUTION<p>Of that unfortunate young Man,<p>WILLIAM&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;M'INTYRE,<p>belonging to Glasgow, who was Executed at Edinburgh on<br>Wednesday morning the 26th Feb. 1823, for Housebreaking<br>and Theft.<p>Edinburgh, February 26.?This morning, WILLIAM M'lNTYRE was Executed<br>here, pursuant to his sentence, convicted of breaking into the premises of Braehouse,<br>in the Lothian Road, the residence of Miss Ann Butter, and stealing therefrom a<br>quantity of wearing apparel.<p>In his declaration, which was read on his trial, he stated that he was born in Pais-<br>ley, had been a tailor in Glasgow, and came to Edinburgh for employment; that he<br>had been drinking the night previous to his apprehension, and tor want of lodgings<br>went to sleep in a paik, where he was roused by the cry of " Stop Thief," and was<br>taken into custody. We understand that M'Intyre was not his proper name, and<br>that he had never been a tailor but wrought at the calender business in Glasgow,<br>till within these two or three years, when he took up with bad company, and had<br>been several times in Glasgow Bridewell, and had appeared at the bar of the Circuit<br>Court there.<p>The Lord Justice Clerk on proceeding to pass sentence on the unhappy youth,<br>expressed his sorrow that in consequence ot the verdict of a most respectable Jury it<br>it had fallen to his lot to fulfil a melancholy duty. His Lordship said, the crime of<br>housabreaking had become so extremely frequent, as to lead to the supposition that<br>it was not regarded as a capital crime, but the example about to be made would<br>prove the contrary. His Lordship remarked that it was the duty of all to prepare<br>for the great change which awaited them, it was peculiarly so for one whose days<br>were numbered, and earnestly besought him riot to waste. the short time that re-<br>mained to him in this world, but by a thorough, sincere, and heartfelt repentance,<br>endeavour to obtain the forgiveness of Almighty God, through the merits of our bles-<br>sed Saviour. This exhortation, his Lordship said, he gave from the very bottom of<br>his heart, and again entreated him to prepare himself for the great event which sooner<br>or later awaited all mankind.<p>Notwithstanding his efforts to hear his final doom announced with fortitude, he<br>was evidently much distressed, and shed tears from the moment the verdict was re-<br>turned.<p>At about 2O minutes past eight this morning the unfortunate youth proceeded<br>from the Lock-up-house, at the back of the County Hall, to the place of execution<br>at the head of Libberton's Wy'nd, where he was attended by the Rev. Dr. Muir<br>and Mr. Porteons, Chaplain of the Jail. A most earnest prayer having been offered<br>up in his behalf, in which he joined with fervor; be then came forward to the front<br>of the scaffold, and shortly addressed the spectators, exhorting them to avoid bad.<br>company, to attend to the instructions of their parents and guardians, and to be di-<br>ligent in the observance of their religious duties. The exocutioned having adjusted<br>the rope, he gave the signal, when the fatal drop fell, and he died in an instant,<br>almost without a struggle.<p> He was a good looking lad, about 18 years of age. He appeared exceedingly<br>pale, and behaved with great propriety at the fatal spot; and was decently dressed<br>in black. The crowd was not great.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;John Muir, Printer, Glasgow.</p>
