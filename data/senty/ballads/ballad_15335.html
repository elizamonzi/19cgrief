His defences were read, in which he de-<br>nied the jurisdiction of the court to try his case, and also of having<br>wantonly inflicted any punishment to lead to the death of the boy<br>Rae. The diet was continued against him till Monday first, to de-<br>cide this point.

The diet was deserted against<br>the woman, and was dismissed from the bar. The lads were una-<br>nimously found guilty, and sentenced to seven years transportation,<br>on account of no aggravated circumstances attending their case.<br>Charles Quin, and Mary Boyd, Housebreaking and Theft, remitted<br>to the Sheriff.<p>FRIDAY... David Campbell, Forgery, guilty, by his own confes-<br>sion, ...fourteen years transportation.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Christian Dickson, alias Ann<br>Hay, and Elizabeth  Fraser, or  Marlow, alias Elizabeth  Johnston,<br>Theft, aggravated by being habit and repute common thieves, guilty,<br>Dickson being 27, and  Fraser 12 times convicted of theft in the<br>Police Court,....transportation for life.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; John Haggart, a brother of<br>the late notorious David Haggart, and John Smith, accused of steal-<br>ing from a basket placed on the footpath of the easter road to Leith,<br>near the house of William Veitch, farmer there, a black silk gown,<br>belonging to Alison Veitch, his daughter, and of being habit and<br>repute thieves.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr James Brown addressed the jury on behalf of<br>Haggart, and began by beseeching them  not to suffer any associa-<br>tion which the name of Haggart might be calculated  to call forth,<br>to weigh against his client; a name which had been rendered more<br>notorious by a publication, in his mind, is  infamous as any which<br>had ever issued from the  public press of this  country.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He then<br>pointed out to the jury that the aggravation of being habit and re-<br>pute a thief, did not of itself constitute a crime, and, therefore, if<br>the specific crime of theft charged in the ndictment was not  proved,<br>the fact, which he admitted, of the aggravation must go for nothing.<br>In his mind the evidence adduced to bring home the crime to his<br>client was lame and inconclusive, and amounted to no  more but<br>that he was seen on the Easter Road, near the spot where a gown<br>was taken from a basket, and that he Was afterwards seen to go into<br>a gate where that gown was afterwards found.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The evidence, he<br>contended, was altogether presumptive, and  that the presumption<br>was more in favour of his client's innocence than his guilt.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He<br>went minutely into the evidence in support of his view of the case,<br>and confidently asked from the jury a verdict of not proven.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The<br>charge against Smith was given up, and  Haggart was, by a plura-<br>lity of voices, found guilty :?Smith was dismissed from the bar,<br>and Haggart banished for life.<p>Edinburgh,....Printed for the Booksellers,?Price One Penny.</p>
