	<h2>Transcription</h2>
	<p> MELANCHOLY<p>SUICIDE,<p>This morning a case of the most distressing nature has transpired ;<br>tears have been shed by many, whose eyes were strangers to such a<br>sensation. On hearing of the case we repaired to the spot, and have<br>collected the following particulars: ?<p>Miss Ann Bennitt, a fair-haired young woman, 17 years of age,<br>daughter of Mrs Bennitt, a widow, residing in George's Street, was last<br>seen about 7, P.M., yesterday ; for some time previous she appeared very<br>depressed in spirits. On her mother frequently questioning her as to<br>her uneasiness, and in the most affectionate manner conjuring her to<br>unbosom herself, added, " Ann, your case surely informs me of every<br>circumstance." All exertions used by her mother proved quite una-<br>vailing : she became more and more reserved, and often insinuated she<br>was tired of life, and would be glad of death to put an end to her misery.<br>But it has often been observed, that when one seeks the "Grim King<br>of Terrors" he is not to be found; and that the death-seeker must<br>either live on or commit suicide.<p>About half-past seven yesterday she suddenly disappeared, and was<br>never again seen in life ; and being missed for more time than usual, her<br>mother,"fearful of the cause, entered her bed room, to discover, if possi-<br>ble, what had caused her long absence, when, to her grief, as she entered<br>the private 'apartment of her daughter, she found her suspended by her<br>silken scarf, a lifeless corpse. She had committed the act with such<br>determination as to baffle, and wholly prevent any interposition, until<br>found "by her bereaved mother, suspended as above described, cold and<br>stiff in death.<p>The occasion which led to the melancholy catastrophe, are, as far<br>as can be ascertained, as follows :?<p>The deceased, Ann Bennitt, had been courted by a young man, Mr<br>E. S------, a commercial gentleman in this city.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The  passion&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;appeared<br>to be mutual, and the light-hearted girl fondly anticipated she was soon<br>to be joined in the " holy bands of wedlock," by marrying the man of<br>her choice, her playmate almost from her birth, and her first love.<br>she had placed her affections on a villain, who defloured her, and after-<br>wards led another to the "alter of hymen," and that one was her rival.<br>The blow was too much for her to endure ; she drooped, and ultimately<br>put an end to her existence as before described.<p>This is by no means a solitary instance; almost every newspaper<br>contains cases'of a similar nature. They nearly all emanate from the<br>same cause. Mutual attachment is the parent of love ; seduction often<br>usurps the place of marriage ; and the deserted fair one who has forfei-<br>ted her character, her honor, aed her reputation, seeks for shelter in a<br>dishonored and premature grave.<p>The following Letter was found among some papers in her desk,<br>after death :<p>MADAM,?In consequence of some circumstanees I do not wish here<br>to explain, I'beg to state that our intimacy has already gone too far. I<br>regret the urgent necessity I have for breaking up at once all further<br>correspondence with you. You may soon select a partner much berrer<br>suited and one worthier of you, than,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yours respectfully,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;E. S.<p>Another Letter, written in her own hand, addressed to her Mother,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;reads thus:<p>DEAR MOTHER,?The die is cast! The grave yearns to receive,<br>your unworthy and unfortunate child. I have been seduced and dis-<br>honored. My conduct has at once expelled me from the society of those<br>I loved and I now seek an asylum in the grave. I fear death, and the<br>dread of what may follow after; but the dread of being pointed at with<br>the finger of scorn Is to me ten times more terrible than anything I can<br>reasonably expect from the just and humane judge of mankind.  For-<br>give my seducer, and on no account ever reproach him with being the<br>cause of my death. I hope no one will ever be so unfeeling as to cast<br>any  aspersion  on you for what has happened; and will add, as a<br>futher -dying dying request, that my remains may be laid in the sam<br>grave  where my dear sister now lies, and as he who hurried on my pre-<br>mature dissolution does frequently pass a remembrance of his sacred<br>vows so often pledged may produce on his mind a sad retrospection of<br>the past That we may meet in happier climes where "sorrow is a<br>stranger",&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;is the parting prayer of,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  Your  Unfortunate Child,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  ANN  BENNITT.<p>R. REYNOLDS, Printer, &c 489  Lawnmarket.</p>
