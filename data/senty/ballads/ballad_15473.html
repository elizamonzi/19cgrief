	<h2>Transcription</h2>
	<p> From the GlasGow COURIER of this<br>Day, 22d October, 1825.<p>Dreadful Accident!<p>A Full and Authentic Account of the Dreadful and<br>Fatal ACCIDENT that happened the COMET<br>Steam-Boat, on her Passage from Inverness and<br>Fort-William to Glasgow, yesterday morning, Fri-<br>day the 21st October, 1825, when, off Kempock<br>Point, she was suddenly Struck by the Steam Boat<br>AYR, and instantly went down, by which melan-<br>choly cicumstance, SEVENTY Human Beings were<br>in a single moment precipitated into Eternity!!!<p>ON Friday morning the 21st October, 1825, the Steam Boat<br>Comet, with Passengers from Inverness and Fort William,<br>was run down of Kempock point, between Gourock and the Clough<br>Light House, by the Steam Boat Ayr, outward bound. In round-<br>ing the point the vessels came in contact with each other with such ,<br>force and violence, that the Comet went down almost instanteously,<br>when above 70 persons were, in a moment, precipitated into the<br>deep, into Eternity ? Ten only are saved out of above 80, which<br>ware believed to be on board. Amongst those escaped is the Mas-<br>ter, who was got on shore, but in such an exhausted state, that, at<br>the date of our latest accounts, he was unable to give any acccount ,<br>of what had, taken place, or of the Passengers on board. There is<br>too much reason to dread, that the greater number of those<br>who perished, are persons in the superior ranks of life.<p>Twelve dead bodies had been washed ashore at an early hour on<br>Friday morning, amongst these were two genteely dressed females,<br>two black servants, and Mrs. Wright, widow of the late Mr.<br>Archibald Wright, Druggist in Glasgow. In the pockets of the<br>body of a gentleman washed ashore, £70. was found.<p>Amongst those who perished, and whose names we can state<br>from good authority, is Mr. Graham, of Corpach, Mr. M'Allister,<br>W. S. Edinburgh, and Captain Suteerland, of the 33d Regiment,<br>and his Lady, who were only five days married.<p>The body of Captain Sutherland, and another passenger were<br>found in the yawl this morning. Mrs Sutherland caught hold of<br>Mr Colin Alexander Anderson, (the only Cabin passenger who is<br>saved) and for some time clung round him, but in the struggle with<br>the waves, she lost her hold and perished.<p>It is reported that amongst the sufferers is the Lady of a Colonel<br>"' in the army, with a family of seven children, from Inverness ; a<br>Mr. Campbell of Glasgow, with a young gentleman of the same<br>city; but we avoid mentioning names on vague reports, not wish-<br>ing to hurt the feelings of those who may have had friends and<br>acquaintances expected from these quarters of the country.<p>Amongst those that are saved, are the foresaid Mr. Anderson,<br>and the Engineman, Captain M'lnnes, the Pilot, the Carpenter, a<br>man passenger, from Fort George, a young girl, and a woman,<br>who were driven ashore between two tables, considerably bruised,<br>and who, most unfortunatly, lost her child.<p>Edinburgh :?Printed for William Robertson, Flying Stationer.</p>
