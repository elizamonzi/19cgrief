	<h2>Transcription</h2>
	<p> The Battle of Balfron<p>PRICE ONE PENNY<p>The circumstances which gave rise to the following song,<br>are simply these :?On the morning of the 8th of March. 1859.<br>the inhabitants of Balfron, were apprehensive of riotous pro-<br>ceedings  by the navvies employed at the Glasgow Water<br>Works, who had visited the town in great numbers. A de-<br>tachment of military was telegraphed for from Stirling, but<br>before their arrival, about 11 o'clock forenoon, the navvies<br>had decamped and left the town. The song is the production<br>of Mr William Sinclair of Stirling. Copies can only be had,<br>in the Poet's Box, 6 St Audrew's Lane, Glasgow.<p>Air?Guy Fawkes.<p>Hlgt glory to the old Black Watch, & dauntless Sevonty-One<br>And glory to the Ninety-Two. who have such laurels won.<br>And honour to the illustrious few who bravely led them on,<br>To the deathless & the bloodless field of the battle of Balfron.<br>Twas the morning of the 8th of March, & seven by the chime.<br>When rushed down from the Water Works some hundreds<p>in their prime,?<p>Two hundred lrish labourers and Highland navvies ran,<br>Like a torrent from the Water W orks to the'battle of Balfron.<br>And some were armed with picks and spades, and some with<p>bludgeons too,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(they flew :<p>And cart-wheel spokes, and good oak rungs, all gathered as<br>Loud yells & ories rang to the skies, as the navvies hurried on.<br>Hurrah for the Glasgow Water Works & the battle of Balfron.<br>Up started from their dreamy beds the good folks of the tuwn,<br>But little reck'd they such a host was on them coming down;<br>Alarm'd they heard the lrish yell & the thund' ring Gaelic toue.<br>And wished they werel000 miles from the battle of Balfron.<p>They came in wild confusion, with many a loud hurrah,<p>All shouting cries of battle, all eager for the fray?<br>Snobs, fleshers, tailors wondered, while all cried out Ochone,<br>Out, out from every window looked the good folks of Balfron.<br>Still. still the Gælic mingled with the lrish yell and cheer;<br>I wish, cried out a farmer, we had the Scotch Greys here,<br>Or the fighting Enniskillens, who at Balaklava shoue,<br>With the bold dragoons from Dublin, at the battle of Balfron.<br>One louder than the rest exclaimed, friends, this will never do,<br>We'll all be broiled & swallowed up in such an Irish stew,<br>So let us send tor the Forty-Twa who have great battles won,<br>And our town shall be famed in ages for the buttle of Baltron.<br>Then swift as rushing lightning, on letters all of tire,<br>The order to old Stirling flash'd on the telegraphie wire.<br>And in a trice the Righlanders the railway line were on,<br>With rifles, powder, balls and all, for the battle of Balfron.<br>No sooner did the Irish boys and stalwart navvies kuow<br>That the Forty Twa, from Stirling town, had been invited so,<br>Than they cried, och, by the powers, my boys, we'll let them<p>fight alone,<p>And have all the glory to themselves of the battle of Balfron.<br>Hurrah for the Glasgow Water Works, with many a shout<br>and cheer,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (longer here !<p>They cried, as they shouldered spade and rung?We'll be no,<br>And off they sallied, as they came, hurrahing all, well done,<br>We were first to reach and leave the field, of the battle of<p>Balfron.<p>How shall the Muse presume to sing of how the Forty-Twa.<br>Did celebrate a victory. such as they never saw ?<br>Instead of fire locks, Pipes of Peace were lighted one by one.<p>And tobacco smoke?not gunpowder?ascended o'er Balfron.<br>Great whangs of cheese, and cakes and ale,  were by the<p>neighbours brought,<p>For such a bloodless battle ne'er was in old Scotland fought,<br>And medals on the spot wore struck ere yet the feast was done<br>In honour of the victory of the battle of Balfron.<br>Then glory to the old Black Watch & dauntless Seventy One,<p>And Honour to the illustrious few who bravely led them on,<br>To the deathless & the bloodless field of the battle of Balfron,<p>Saturday Morning, May 7, 1859.</p>
