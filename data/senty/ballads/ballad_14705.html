	<p> Execution.<p>Account of the Execution of FRANCIS CAIN & GEORGE<br>LAIDLAW, for two different crimes, and who suffered at<br>Glasgow, on Wednesday the 29th'October, 1823, with their<br>Behaviour since their condemnation and at the Scaffold.<p>Glasgow, Oct. 29th, 1823.?This day, the two above named young men underwent<br>the awful sentence passed upon them at last Circuit, for the following crimes :<p>FRANCIS CAIN, for assaulting and robbing Jamas Maxwell, coppersmith, of a<br>gold watch with a gold chain and two gold seals, a purse containing eight pounds,<br>some silver, and his hat, on the 9th July last. The evidence adduced stated that he<br>did attack James Maxwell at Shawfield Tell, near Lift's Govan, and did knock him<br>down with some unlawful weapon, and did rob him of the articles already mentioned.<p>GEORGE LAIDLAW, for breaking into the shop of Messrs. Solomon and Had-<br>kins, jewellers, Nelson Street, Glasgow, on the 30th March, 1823, by means of false<br>keys, and stealing therefrom a number of gold and silver articles. The evidence<br>completely proved the guilt of the prisoner.<p>These two men have, since they received their sentence, conducted themselves in<br>a most exemplary manner, and aided by the exertions of several of the Ministers of<br>the city, were brought to a deep sense of the sinfulness of their past lives, and hoped<br>for forgiveness from man as well, as pardon from God. They were supported in their<br>solitary cell by the aid of prayer, the songs of praise, and the conversation of pious<br>men ; these religious exercises soothed their minds, dispelled their fears, animated<br>their hopes, and raised their affections above this passing scene to that happier state<br>of being, which they (guilty and sinful as they had lived) hoped, through the merits<br>of their Saviour, yet to enjoy. Cain, though of a carelesser disposition than Laidlaw,<br>has been nearly as assiduous in the work given him to do ; he had still a glimmering<br>hope of mercy till the time his companion received a respite, when the fond delusion<br>fled, and he became perfectly resigned to his fate. Laidlaw has all along been deeply<br>impressed with the awful state in which he was placed; she hope of mercy never for<br>a moment retarded him in his preparations for the vast unknown into which he was<br>So soon to enter, and the few  weeks allotted him were spent in endeavouring to make<br>" his calling and election sure."<p>The night previous to their execution they slept but little, and' spent the most of<br>it in reading, and hearing others do the same; prayers and praises were also offered<br>in their behalf, and from the dawn of morning to the time that  they appeared at the<br>awful brink of eternity, every thing that man could do was exercised for their sup-<br>port, consolation, and future prospects. After taking a long  farewell of some of their<br>fellow prisoners, they proceeded to the Hall, and  after the asual religious services<br>were gone through namely, reading, prayer and praise, the Magistrates ordered the<br>Hall to be cleared, and the prisoners in a short time followed, and walked to the  last<br>scene of suffering in a very composed manner. They spent a few minutes in fer-<br>vent prayer, the signal was thrown, and after a few convulsive struggles their career<br>on earth was finished. They were decently dressed ; the crowd resembled was very<br>great ; a party of the Inniskillen Dragoons and the 73d foot guarded the scaffold .<p>Cain was hired to the cotton spinning business, and is about  17 years of age ; his<br> father and mother, and some sisters, are left to deplore his untimely end&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His parents<br>are Irish, but have been a long  time in this country, and reside in the Gorbals.<p>Laidlaw was by trade a wright, and is about 20 years, of age ; he belongs to Ander-<br>ston, and his parents are still alive.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They thanked those who had the care of them<br>for the kind treatment they had received in their temporal&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;concerns,  and the Mini-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>sters for the interest they had taken in their spiritual welfare.<p>The fate of these young men should, (but it too seldom does) operate as a warning<br>to the young ; temptations to evil are numerous,  inveiglers many, and thieves  in<br>abundance ; they, therefore, cannot be too guarded, neither too well warned, to flee<br>from such company,  and to  tread those steps, which lead to happiness here and to&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>happiness hereafter.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; W. Carse, Printer, Glasgow.</p>
