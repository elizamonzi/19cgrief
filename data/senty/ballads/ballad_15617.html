	<h2>Transcription</h2>
	<p> A true Copy of a Letter Tent by the Lady Boghall to  her Son Nicol Mushet,  Prisoner within<br>the Tolbooth of Edinburgh, for the Murder of his own Wife.<p>NICOL,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  At Boghall, 21. NOVEMBER 1720.<p>I CANNOT now in writing give you such Expressions of Affection, as I formerly<br>used, for you have by your Wicked and Abominable Crimes, made me ashamed an for-<br>ry to own the Relation of a Mother to you. Woe is me that ever I should have Born<br>and Nursed up such a Rebellious Son, that has not only been Unnatural many ways to me,<br>and set Light by all my Admonitions and Reprooss ; but has now added tins Grievous and<br>Horrid Sin to all former Debaucheries, to put Hand, in so Unnatural and Barbarous a Manner,<br>in your own Flesh, and Murder the Wife of your Bosom. You are now in GOD'S Righte-<br>ous Judgment for all your Sins, which are Naked and Open in his Sight, brought into a Prison,<br>and expecting the Deserved Punishment of your Unparalled Barbarity: It is not Time to Flatter<br>your self with Thought s of Escaping the Stroke of Deserved Justice, by placing Advocats to<br>Psead in your Behalf, and Denying the Fact before the Judges. Let Josuah's Words to Achan<br>be duly pondered by you, and give Glory to GOD by a Full, Free and Ingenious Coefession ;<br>and instead of Contriving Ways to Save your Natural Life, see that you Spend, what a [  ]<br>Inch of your Time now Remains, in a Solemn, Serious, Preparation tor Death. Consider I<br>Beseech thee, Oh ! poor Misfortunate Wretch, thy lost Estate by Nature, the Unmortified<br>Wickedness that is in thy Heart, to which thou has given such loose Reins, how fearfully thou<br>has provoked the Holy and Righteous GOD to Wrath against thy poor Soul, by, Trampling<br>on his Holy Law, and Despising all his Holy and Righteous Admonitions, Warnings and Re-<br>proofs, sinning against so much Light, Means and Mercies, and that to Enormously shewing<br>that thy only Pleasure and Delight was in Doing the Works of the Devil, and Reproaching thy<br>Maker, by Sinning presumptoutly against him. Surely if ever the LORD give thee a Right<br>Sight of thy Self in Mercy, thou wilt see thy self to be the Chief of Sinners. But, Oh ! I fear<br>thou art far from such a Sight of thy Miserable and Dangerous Condition ; thou hast indeed<br>brought me low by many Sad Courses of Wickedness, but that which Troubles me most goes<br>nearest my Heart, now Sunk into a Benummedness with many Multiplied Sorrows, is that when<br>I was with you, I saw so small Signs of your being any Way Sensible of the greatness of your<br>Wickedness, and no Evidence of Godly Sorrow and True Repentance. Oh ! Nicol think of<br>it in good Earnest, how near you are to the Pit of Distruction, how few Days will Land your<br>poor Soul in that Burning Lake of Fire and Brimston, if an Ocean of Infinite Mercy and Grace<br>prevent it not, if the Precious. Blood of CHRIST, the LAMB of GOD that takes away the<br>Sins of the World, be not applyed to your poor Guilty Soul, to Wash away the Dreadful Slime<br>of all your Hainous Sins, and particularly that of Blood Guiltiness ; and does thou think,<br>thou, O Deluded Wretch, to get this Mercy without being heartily concerned for it, without<br>Deep and Inseigned Repentance. It may be, Nicol, ye are Concerned for the outward Misery<br>and Misfortune ye have Involved your Self into, and that Ignominious Death that ye must Sur-<br>fer as the Condign Punishment of this your Crime; but alas what is all that to the Wrath of an<br>Incensed GOD,which ye must bear through all Eternity, if GOD whose Rich in Mercy, upon your<br>Repentance, and Flieing to CHRIST prevent it not, all that you have to Suffer from the Hard<br>of Man, is just Nothing in Comparison of that Wrath. O let the Consideration of this<br>throughly Affect your Heart, and be Earnest in Supplication to the LORD for Grace to Repent<br>and Believe in the LORD CHRIST for Pardon; what a Comfort would it be to me to Hear<br>that you had got a Right Sight of your Sins in Mercy, I would bear the Indignation of the<br>LORD, in this astonishing Calamity that has befallen me in my old Age, and is like to bring my<br>Gray Heirs to the Grave with Sorrow, I would bear it, I say, with Patience, yea, with Joy,<br>if Joy could enter such a Disconsolate Heart as mine, if I had any just Ground of Hope of<br>your poor Souls Well-being. I dare not have one With that you should Escape the Hand or<br>justice from Man as to your Body, for I fear it would be no Mercy to you, tho' such a Thing<br>were possible to be obtained. But my Heart's Desire and Prayer to GOD for you, is That<br>you might get a Saving cast of tree Grace to Work in you, Real, Godly Sorrow for all your.<br>Bloody and  Hainous Crimes, that your Spirit might be Saved in the Day of the LORD, tho'<br>your Flesh be justly Destroyed,and that as you have been Eminent for Disnorouring the LORD<br>by your Sin, you might be a Wonder of the Riches of Free Grace and Mercy in being plucked<br>as a Brand out of the Fire, and as a poor loft Sheep plucked by the Shepherd out of the Jaws<br>of that Devouring Lyon the Devil, but tho' I and all the Christians that ever heard of you<br>should Pray for this, if you be not hearty in seeking it your self, and get CHRIST placed as<br>your ADVOCAT and Interceslor at the Fathers Right Hand, you need never look to obtain<br>it, or then be Earnest with the LORD about this Matter, and fee that ye make this your one<br>Thing, arid give Glory to GOD by an Upright Confession of all your Sins, take Shame to<br>your Self that he may have Glory, and cast your self at the Feet of his Glorious MAJESTY,<br>begging Mercy through our LORD JESUS CHRIST, whose Blood only washeth the Penitent<br>and "Broken-hearted Believer from all Sin. The LORD himself give you Grace to Concider<br>what I say, that I be not a Witness against you in that Day, when you stand before the Tri-<br>bunal of the Righteous Judge of all the Earth; it may be this may be the last Advice you shall<br>over have from your Afflicted, Sorrowful and Disconsolate Mother.<p>JEAN&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;MUSHET.<p>EDINBURGH, Printed by Mm Btown in Forrester's-Wynd:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1720.  </p>
