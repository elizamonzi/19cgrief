	<h2>Transcription</h2>
	<p> An account of that<br>barbarous murder on<br>the body of a shearer,<br>in the village of currie<br>near Edinburgh, by<br>some journeymen ma-<br>sons on Monday last.<p>On Monday evening, a poor man, with his wife and<br>fire children, the youngest, we understand, aged about <br>nine months, and carrying with him a certificate of<br>excellent character, arrived at the village of Currie on<br>his way to the harvest shearing. At currie they were<br>provided by an hospitable individual with the accom-<br>modation of a shed for the night. In a public house<br>near to the shed, a mason and some of his companions<br>were carousing; and the wife of the mason finding it<br>impossible by ordinary entreaties, to prevail on him to<br>return home, invented a story that the poor stranger<br>had been making voilent intrusions into her house.<br>On the story being told to the mason, he and his com-<br>panions proceeded to the shed where the poor family<br>were asleep, and by some of them, the husband was<br>dragged from his bed and inhumanly murdered. The<br>inhuman murderers have been apprehended and lodged<br>in Edinburgh Jail.<p>We copy this murder and suicide from the same<br>paper.?The town and neighbourhood of Barnet was<br>thrown into the utmost consternation, on Tuesday, by<br>the report that two ladies were murdered at Hadley<br>Green.- Mrs Spencer, a widow lady of great respect-<br>ability, 60 years of age, and her daughter, aged 39.<br>The bodies were found  in the morning by the servants,<br>their clothes completely saturated with blood, and a<br>bloody razor was found near the spot. The premises<br>were examined, and every thing found secure, without<br>the slightest marks of violence. An inquest was held<br>on Wednesday at the White Bear, Hudley, to inquire<br>into the mysterious circumstances. Ann White, a<br>cook in the family, stated, that on Monday night she<br>saw both her mistresses, but did not observe any thing<br>peculiar in their behaviour. About eight o'clock on<br>Tuesday morning, the ladies not having come down to<br>breakfast, witness became alarmed, and asked the<br>housemaid to call them. Not receiving any answer,<br>they waited until nine, and then both went up, when<br>on opening the outer door of the bed-chamber, they<br>observed blood on one of the beds, hut no one in the<br>room. Witness became exceedingly terrified, and ran<br>for assistance. She heard one of them walking about<br>between four and five o'clock. In answer to other<br>questions, she stated that she never heard her mis-<br>tresses quarrelling, but that on Saturday Mrs Spencer<br>told her she must, bring her bed into their room, as she<br>was alarmed at her daughter's behaviour. A nurse in<br>the family proved that Miss Spenoer was very eccen-<br>tric, and appeared to her at times out of her senses.<br>Other witnesses spoke to the same effect. After the<br>Coroner hrd summed up the evidence, the Jury, after<br>a few minutes' consultation, returned the following<br>verdict:?' That Mary Spencer, senior, met her death<br>from wounds inflicted by her daughter, who afterwards<br>cut her own throat, being at the time in a state of<br>mental derangement.</p>
