The meeting house was crowded by a<br>miscellaneous assemblage of ladies and gentlemen.<p>A Dyer from the Horse Wynd took the Chair,<br>and opened the business with :?" Gentlemen and<br>Ladies, Ye ar' a' awar' what we ha' met about, and<br>the clerk will write the resolutions."<p>The clerk read resolutions (same as previously<br>published by College Street Chapel.)<p>A Glazier then said, that he had great pleasure in<br>seconding resolutions which he meant to have done<br>exlempor: and though he detested all reading with-<br>in the walls of that house, yet having been rather<br>unwell a' day, he had committed his thoughts to pa-<br>per, which he would now read?The learned gentle-<br>man then threw a strong light upon the history of<br>Organs?beginning with the age of Constantine?<br>the era of the union of Church and State (which is<br>a favourite standing topic in all Relict  speeches)?<br>and 300 years before organs were known. He<br>narrated that Organs were brought to this country<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;along with the graven images from Home, and laid<br>it down as sound doctrine, that both Organs and im-<br>ages were denounced by the Second Command-<br>ment. He held that the organ was shadowed forth<br>by the beast with the seven heads and ten horns in<br>the Revelations. He informed the audience that<br>the four last Stewarts had attempted to plant the<br>Organ on the mountains of Scotland, but that the<br>plant would not thrive, and was uprooted entirely<br>by King William of blessed memory; and since<br>that time there had been only one attempt to revive<br>the said plant, which had been cut down and eradi-<br>eated ; and he hoped the Roxburgh place plant<br>would be dealt with in the same way, and that the<br>axe would be laid to the root of this foreign tree.<br>He therefore cordially seconded the resolutions?<br>(Great applause.)<p>Here it seemed to be expected that the resolu-<br>tions would pass harmoniously; but in a meeting<br>of perhaps a thousand persons this was rather un-<br>reasonable.<p>A Plasterer, after being scrutinised in a tumultu-<br>ary style whether he was a member, proposed an<br>amendment, the purport of which was, that the<br>matter should be left entirely to the proper autho-<br>rities of the Relief Church, without any in-<p>terfence by the meeting. This amendment was<br>seconded, and great applause given to it as well<br>as to the resolutions. After this a scene of up-<br>roar ensued, which it is impossible to describe.?<br>The chairman, who did not seem inclined to hear<br>any argument in favour of the Organ, called out,<br>" Clap a plaister on Wull Stark"s mouth there,"<br>and various other similar interruptions were given.<p>A person present rose, and having been duly test-<br>ed as to his membership, said, that he found organe<br>mentioned in several of the Psalms as an instru-<br>ment in the service of God. Another person re-<br>joined, that in the Psalms it was also said that we<br>were enjoined to bind to the horns of the altar<br>" with cords the sacrifice;" and that an ox or a bul-<br>lock, or any beast that hath both horn or hoof would<br>just be as profitable to edification as the Organ ; and<br>as for himself he would much rather see the bullock<br>than the organ in the church?(Great roaring,). A<br>person near us observed, that the Preses at this<br>stage of the proceedings was a little ramfuzled, not<br>knowing what would be the fate of the resolutions;<br>and having shown a disposition to press the resolu-<br>tions for adoption, the Preses was reminded that it<br>was his business in the chair not to give his own<br>opinions, but to collect the opinions of others?and<br>he was informed that he had already sufficiently<br>stultified himself for the night?(Applause?mur-<br>murs?hisses, &c.)<p>One person proposed that the Dyer should be re-<br>moved from the chair?another, that the clerk<br>should be put into the chair?and a third, that the<br>chair should be put into the clerk. " Let the Elders<br>that rule well, be counted worthy of double ho-<br>nour." I Tim. v. 17.<p>A member exhorted the me ting that they should<br>abstain from hissing, as it typified the serpent spo-<br>ken of in the Old Testament. Another member said<br>talking of the Old Testament, that Organs were<br>played in those times, and why should they not now<br>be played upon. The gentleman who seconded the<br>resolutions very pointedly replied, that if all these<br>Auld Testament matters" were to be brought back,<br>we might at once have circumcision. (Hisses,groans,<br>and strong marks of disapprobation by the ladies.)<p>There was then a stormy, and not very intelligi-<br>ble dispute about putting the resolutions and a-<br>mendment; and after shewing hands right and left,<br>the resolutionists concluded they had carried their<br>resolutions by a great majority. The diet was<br>opened and closed with prayer !?Such a scene beg-<br>gars description, and needs no comment.<p>Is it not absurd for for such  illiterate and vulgar speaking men to be rulers of a church ?&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Wha's that talkin'<br>there WILLIE  SMITH ! gi'e him a daud i' the lug the daft  brute, what right has he to set up his  chat !<p>Stand yont or I shave him ! ! ! han' me yir Stick Tam.<br>Published by W. SMITH, No. 3, Bristo Port.</p>
