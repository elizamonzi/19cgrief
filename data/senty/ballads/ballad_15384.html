With re-<br>spect to myself I have little to say : I have been<br>most miserable in this unhappy land. I  have suf-<br>fered every degradation of life : insult upon insult<br>have been heaped upon me ; I have been obliged<br>to associate with the most depraved of human be-<br>ing, my master's men. Separated from all hope<br>of comfort and enjoyment, debarred from all re-<br>ligious worship, I have been ready to murmur at<br>the decrees of the Almighty. What can I say to<br>you ? I am living one hundred and fifty miles<br>from Sydney, Up the mountains, forty miles from <br>any place of worship.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The voice of prayer is never<br>heard, and all is blasphemy and wickedness ; and<br>I have to labour in the field at all kinds of toil, un-<br>der the heat of a meridian sun, and am become a-<br>like indifferent to comforts of all kinds. When I<br>am hungry I eat-when I am thirsty I drink ; I<br>receive my mess as another.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We grind in a hand-<br>mill-we bake in the ashes-and we live in miser-<br>able huts, which admit both wind and rain. A<br>sheet of cork and a bundle of straw is our bed, and<br>a blanket is our covering ; but fatigue is ours, and<br>we sleep as well as if on beds of down. A shirt<br>and duck trowsers form our dress.  I have learned<br>to reap, to shear sheep, to fell timber, to burn it<br>off, in short, I can do almost all laborious work.<br>Gracious God ! could the rising youth  but have a<br>single glance of the prisoner in New South Wales,<br>they would surely shun the temptation to crime.<br>The slightest offence provokes flowing ; insolence<br>is the bug-bear of the colony ; for this I have seen<br>men sent to an iron gang, to work in chains, and<p>be  half fanished, or tied up to receive the igno-<br>minious punishment of sixty or seventy-five lashes.<br>Shame on the name of Englishmen ! A man who<br>calls himself  a settler ,  first imposes upon his slaves,<br>and goads them on to speak, and then drags them<br>before a magistrate  to be lashed and tortured for<br>insolence.  If  a slave speak, the wretch's stomach<br>is taxed. We all feel a tenfold  degradation&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;here ;<br>we feel that we are slaves to paltry tyrants, who<br>seem as if they were born to add to the stings and <br>torture's of wretched criminels.  If a Government<br>servant sees his master's  property going to ruin, it<br>is ten to one but he passes on and takes no notice ;<br>he argues that it is no interest of his ; and thus<br>the settler, by not studying his men's interest, for-<br>gets his own. The men receive no wages, and not<br>suffcient clothing&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;True, the authorities will say,<br>" Why do you not complain to us ? and it shall be<br>remedied " ; but do you think that many will, or<br>dare complain, when the authorities will support<br>the settler, and that the master is sure to take his<br>revenge ! Tea, sugar, and tobacco, are called in-<br>dulgences, and rest with the discretion of the mas-<br>ter, who seldom forgets to use his power like a<br>giant. With respect to liberty, it is a thing that<br>few now get possession of ; a Lifer must serve eight<br>years with one master,-ten with two,-and one<br>year additional for every additional master&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The<br>smile of bitterness comes over my face whilst I<br>write this ; may God enable me to overcome this<br>sensation.  Why is a man debarred all chance of<br>liberty, whose conduct may be irreproachable ?<br>Much of the misery and crime committed by con-<br>victs may be attributed  to the almost total extinc-<br>tion of their hope of liberty.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As to myself, I once<br>did think of a mitigation, but all hopes are gone ;<br>I am like a piece of mechanism ; my spirit is so<br>such broken by disappointments and hardships,<p>that I feel a dreadful indifference creep upon me-<br>my life appears a blank, and futurity is my only<br>source of expectation.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One step alone appears be-<br>fore me ; I shall consider of it twelve months, and<br>then make my election.<p>Immediately on my landing in September 1827,<br>my fellow-userers and  I were assigned to settlers<br>up the country.  The master I was then assigned<br>to is still living, and I can have his testimonials as<br>to the blamelessness of my conduct.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I have also<br>the strongest testimonials of good conduct during<br>our passage. The Superintendant was very anxious<br>to gain me  some situation suitable to me, but the<br>letters he wrote to the  Secretary were neglected by<br>the chief mate, who was to send them on shore ;<br>and I was in consequence assigned to my present<br>employer, as his Excellency had signed it, and it<br>could not be reversed.<p>My health is much impaired, but complaints are<br>in vain.  I am sorry to inform you that poor Rob<br>Smith was lately executed at Sydney, in company<br>with five others, for being concerned in the robbery<br>and murder of their master and mistress.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But al-<br>though such executions are frequent, the repetition<br>of crime is daily occurring.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We are not permitted<br>to see a paper ; and, indeed, if we are seen to con-<br>verse much with each other, it is ten to one but we<br>are either dragged before a magistrate and punish-<br>ed with a severe flogging, or else some of our pro-<br>visions ore stopped.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope and trust you will<br>make this letter as public as possible ; and that it<br>may be the means of turning many from their pre-<br>sent dishonest practices, is the earnest prayer of<p>YOUR  UNFORTUNATE SON,<p>JOHN PATERSON.<p>When you write to me, direct in the same manner<br>as you sent the last</p>
