We landed here when we got on<br>shore. Our first battle was at Never-sa-dhi. There was many thousands killed,<br>but I am happy to state there were no lives lost, I myself killed twenty-nine<br>out of a eleventeen who attacked me with loaded bayonets, in the midst of whi-<br>ch one of the natives rushed upon me with a double-barrelled bootjack, but I<br>managed to blow his brains out with a pair of scissors. 1 slept three nignts in a<br>dry ditch full of water. The last time I saw Mick Johnston he was quite well.<br>and the next time I spoke to him he was dead. If he had liyed till to-morrow he<br>would have been dead a mounth. He leaves a child and l6 small wives in a<br>high state of low fever.<p>Send me the newspaper when you write, I have nothing to read but the<br>History of England, I was reading it the other day. and I find that when Ki-<br>ng Nebuchadnezzar attacked the Indians on Law Hill, Alexander the Great and<br>Sir William Wallace took Constantinople prisoner, whilst Julias Cæsar and Lord<br>Nelson fought the Hottentots at Auchtermochty. it was somewhere about this<br>that MaeGonegall the Great, Fizzie Gow. Blin' Houghi, and Blue Jock won the<br>The Battle of Waterloo !<p>Give my love to Bridget O'Flannagan, and tell her I will write when I get<br>killed, and 1ot her know how I get on.

You need not wait for another till you get impatient, but write imm-<br>ediately and let me know how you are coming on, and I will bring you home a<br>peice of the Nort Pole for a walking-stick.<p>Having altered my mind, I am determined not to send this letter at all, so<br>you can answer it or not just as you please. When yome come to the end don't<br>read any more. I had almost forgotten to mention that I have been very all<br>The Doctor said It was consumptive, but I declined. But I am still verry bad<br>with the " Tweasles, [  ] and I am daily expecting each evening that every munite<br>will be my next.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If I am as bad to day as I was to-morrow, I go to the Infir-<br>mary yesterday,?Yours till death, if not before it,<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;JIMMY.<p>2:th Royal Besom Mop-Squirting Brigade,<br>Pipeclay Dusting Depo, 375 miles<br>On the othe side of the world.</p>
