	<p> THE LAST SPEECH & DYING WORDS<p>OF THAT UNFORTUNATE<p>Potatoe Merchant<br>AND Mealmonger,<p>Who underwent the awful Sentence of the Law, on Wednesday the<br>14th January, 1824, and his body hung in  chains on the hill of<br>Ballengiech, for the abominable crime of Forstalling the Meal and<br>Potatoe Markets, and thereby raising the price of Provisions.<p>IT may be necessary, in the first place, to<br>say that the unfortunate man was faithfully<br>warned by the voice of a descrning public, of<br>the evil consequences attendant on such a con<br>duct, ond that in the end, it would infallibly<br>lead to shame, disgrace, and ruin?but, awful<br>to relate, he still rushed on his mad career,<br>until the iron hand of Justice arrested him.?<br>As his crime was so justly detested by the<br>people at large; he was no sooner tried than<br>he was, by a plurality of voices found Guilty.<br>Sentence was then passed by the Judge, which<br>was as follows :?<p>" You notorious criminal who are now found<br>guilty, must, without the least hope of mercy<br>be HANGED by the neck until you be dead!<br>dead! dead! &c. &c. and your body bung in<br>chains on the hill of Ballingeich, with your<br>crime printed in capital letters placed over its<br>head?-your flesh food for the fowls of the air,<br>and your bones bleached with the sun and <br>rains of Heaven; that all who pass by may<br>know for what you suffer, and also that the<br>shocking crime of forestalling the Meal mar-<br>ket may be abhorred by the public to all fu<br>ture generations."<p>In consequence of the above sentence, the<br>unfortunate man, dressed in green clothes,<br>with a small bag of oatmeal in one hand, and<br>a potatoe in the other was conducted to the<br>gallows?where he in a short, but impressive<br>speech, addressed the audience as follows:?<p>" My dear fellow merchants, citizens, and<br>all present, you see what I am to suffer, and<br>all for the sake of Meal and Potatoes. I hope<br>you will take warning by my example, and<br>never try to enrich yourself by pinching the<br>bellies of the poor. I do confess that I suffer<br>justly, for my crime has been great in its nature,<br> evil in its tendency, pernicious in its design,<br>and awful in its end. Its nature was bad, for<br>it involved in it the crime of Sabbath-breaking,<br>for I have often proclaimed it at the Parish <br>Churches all round the country, which had the<p>evil tendency of taking off the attention of the<br>people from the solemn truths their pastor<br>had been teaching them?and the whole con<br>versation turned on the price of Meal and Po<br>tatoes. My design was truly pernicious, as I<br>intended to enrich myself by starving the poor.<br>And now you see the end is truly awful! I am<br>to suffer justly; and awful to say I die guilty!<br>My dear neighbours, I see I must have done<br>as it evidently appears I have few friends<br>here?-the very children exult in my death, as<br>the little rogues they devour their pieces of<br>cake loaded with butter, and munch their po-<br>tatoes and salt?the very hangman himself is<br>divested of all compassion towards unworthy<br>me--? do you not hear him saying, ' I shall soon<br>do the job-?Meal and Potatoes will soon be<br>cheap.' Therefore, soon I must suffer, and<br>all for the sake of Meal and Potatoes. I hope<br>my dear neighbours, you will all have the good-<br>ness to grant me the last request I shall ever<br>make, as it is with my dying breath- I request<br>that none of you will ever eat of Meal or Po-<br>tatoes, without remembering that 'thus I suf<br>fer for the exhorbitant prices of them." '<p>No sooner had the unfortunate man uttered<br>these words, than he made the signal to the<br>executioner, by dropping a small bag of oat-<br>meal from the one hand, and a potatoe from<br>the other, and was immediately launched from<br>the present into an eternal world. The hang-<br>man then exclaimed,  I have done the job,<br>Meal and Potatoes will be cheap.' The popu-<br>lace hailed his exit with three loud huzzas---__<br>one solitary voice cried out ' unfortunate man!'<br>which was soon traced to the young wife of a<br>farmer who had come to the market with meal<br>and potatoes, but, by the death of the unfor-<br>tunate Forestaller, was deprived of the high<br>price his commodities lately sold for.<p>He was attended in his devotions by the<br>Rev. Josiah Habakkuk of Ballengeich, and Je-<br>didiah Harrowfield, non conformist Minister<br>of Stibbleton.<p>printed by JOHN MUIR,Glasgow.</p>
