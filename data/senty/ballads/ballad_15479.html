	<p> A Full and Particular Account of the Execution of<br>JOHN M'GRADDY, who was Executed at Stir-<br>ling, on Friday the 26th May, 1826, containing the<br>particulars of his Trial, and his behaviour since the<br>time he received sentence of death, and at the place<br>of Execution.<p>STIRLING, 26th May, 1826. This day the unfortunate man<br> underwent the last mandate of the law in front of our prison<br>here, for housebreaking and theft, in the house of the Rev. Mr<br>M'Call, of Muiravonside.<p>The first witness the Rev. William M'Call, stated that his house<br>was broken into, upon the llth December last, about 1 o'clock in<br>the morning, when he heard a noise come from the north part of<br>the house, he started up, but thought it was occasioned by the ser-<br>vants working, he came to the stair head, where he saw a light be-<br>low, and in a few minutes two men rushed up stairs, one of them<br>had on something like a. spanish cloak, and held it up so as to con-<br>ceal his face, one of them was armed with a pistol, and the other<br>with a sword; the one with the pistol said, If you do not give up<br>your money I will shoot you ; they then forced him back to the<br>bed-room, and went directly to a chest of drawers, and ransacked<br>them, they carried off a sum of money which had been collected for<br>the deaf and dumb institution in Edinburgh ; saw them carry away<br>a gold watch which hung beside the window.?saw them take from<br>a press some silver teaspoons, when they were at the press, witness<br>stood in the passage opposite the front door, and took the oppor-<br>tunity of opening the door and making his escape to the house of<br>Mr Read, a farmer in the neighbourhood, here he got assistance, but<br>on returning the fellows were gone. He said there was a great<br>number of shirts and stockings taken away, here a pair of stockings<br>were shown him which he indentified as his property, on being<br>asked if the two prisioners at the bar were the men, he said they<br>were about the size of the men that were in the house ; but could<br>not swear to them, as he did not see their faces.<p>Janet Roberts, and Elizebeth Taylor, corroborated the evidence<br>of the proceeding witness.<p>Edward Quin, boatman to the Union Canal, stated that he saw<br>M'Graddy shortly after the robbery, when he told him, that the<br>manse had been broken into and that he, M'Graddy, was one of<br>the persons engaged in it, he saw the officers find a pair of stockings<br>among the coals; saw M'Graddy wear a pair like them, and that he<br>had them on just before the officers came up.<p>Andrew M'Kay, stated that lie was one of them that apprehended<br>M'Graddy, that he found the pair of stockings shown in court among<br>the coals, near where M'Graddy was lying, who had no stockings<br>on, and the weather was remarkably cold at the time.<p>Several other witnesses were examined, after which the Advocate-<br>depute addressed the Jury for the Crown, and Mr Bruce for M'-<br>Graddy. Lord M'Kenzie then summed up the evidence, at consi-<br>derable length, when the Jury, after deliberating a few minutes, re-<br>turned a verdict of Guilty. After an impressive address, he was<br>sentenced to be executed at Stirling, on Friday the 26th May 1826,<br>upon hearing which, he was so much affected that the officers had<br>to carry him away from the bar.<p>Since his condemnation, we understand, he has behaved himself<br>with great propriety, and becoming his melancholy situation ; he<br>was attended by the ministers of the Town, who did all in their<br>power to compose his mind, and to make him lay hold on the hope<br>set before him in the gospel, to whom he paid great attention.<p>Accordingly, this day at two oclock, the Magistrates, attended by<br>their officers, entered the Town-hall, where some of the clergy and<br>others were in attendance on the prisoner. After spending some<br>short time in devotional exercise, they proceeded to the scaffold,<br>where prayers were again put up for the unhappy man. He then<br>affectionately took leave of those around him, shaking hands with<br>the officers respectively. He left the jail with great reluctance, and<br>when the executioner appeared with a white cotton cap, he would<br>not permit him to put it on, but put on a striped Kilmarnock one,<br>which he pulled out of his own pocket. After considerable hesita-<br>tion, and after every thing was prepared, he dropt the fatal signal,<br>and was launched into eternity, in presence of a great multitude of<br>spectators. We trust this awful example will have its due effect on<br>all those who witnessed it.<p>He was a native of Ireland, and a well-looking young man, about<br>21 or 22 years of age, and nearly 6 feet high; we cannot learn that<br>he had any trade, but was generally employed as a labourer ; and<br>at the time he committed the robbery, he was plying with a coal-<br>boat on the Union Canal.</p>
