	<h2>Transcription</h2>
	<p> Account of a barbarous, & inhuman murder, committed by the<br>Revd Mr. Carroll., Parish Priest of Ballymore, on the body of a<br>child of 3 years old, also an account of his brutal usage of other<br>woemen' 2 of whom are not expected to live.<p>For several days it had been intimated by notices sent round the<br>Counrtry that a miracle was to be wrought on Friday last by the<br>Revd. John Carroll Roman Catholic Priest of Ballymore.. On that<br>day he visited a man of the name of Henry Neale, who was dan-<br>gerously ill of appoplexy. He said the man was troubled with<br>devils, Jumped on him several times and bade the people present<br>to join him in prayer to disposess the evil spirits, one of them nam-<br>ed Peggy Dandy was so frightened that she fell to the ground in<br>hysterics on which Mr. Carrol Jumped out of bed off Neal's body,<br>seized her, swearing she was full of Devils, and called upon Jesus<br>to assist them in expelling them. He. trampled on the woman,<br>broke some of her ribs, and left her for dead, and then said he<br>would go and bury the devils whom he had secured. The blood<br>was gurgling in the womans throat, and some of the Credulous<br>people who were looking on exclaimed they saw the devils come<br>out of her mouth. The Priest went to Assaily bridge, and on his<br>return said he had buried the reptiles in hell. He then, went to<br>the house of Robert Moran, and struck his wife repeatedly that she<br>was scarce able to,speak, and her head was swelled in a shocking<br>manner. He next went to the house of Thomas Sinnot, accom-<br>panied all the time by a vast number of people, asked the mistress<br>for some refreshment, which she gave him. At this time a fine<br>little girl between 3 and 4 years old, being in bed began to cry, on<br>which he consulted his Breviary and declared there was a devil in<br>the child and immediatly jumped into the bed, and on the body<br>of the infant.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>The child cried mournfully'save me, O save me. Her father coming in. endeavoured to<br>save her, but was restrained by the Spectators, and even the child's mother declared she<br>believed the Priest was working a miracle to drive the devil out of her child,and actually<br>assisted him in his operations, He ordered her to get a tub of water and some salt, these<br>she instantly procured. The innocent sufferer lay bleeding & insensible in bed: he poured<br>the contents of the tub upon her, and as the the. water mingled with the stream of life, he<br>cried with enthusiam, Behold a miracle; I have turned the water into blood!, he then turn-<br>ed the tub over his victim; the edge of it coming on the child's neck, completed the tragedy<br>by putting an end to its sufferings.<br>Having desired the parents, not to allow any one to enter nor to touch the child, he de- <br>parted for Wexford, His direction was religiously obeyed and the besotted parents anxiously<br>awaited his arrival, next day his (the Priest's Sister) called on them and told them their <br>child would  be quite well on her Brothers return!!!&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>It now turns out that the Priest was deranged, and knew not what he did; but how shall  <br>we account for the conduct of the croud of Spectators, around him, many of whem assisted<br>him in the furtherance of his design, and all of them placed implicit confidence in the pre-<br>priety of his proceedings: who would have thought, such fanaticism could exist in this en-l<br>lightened age?&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; '<br>A Coroner's Jury sat on the body, & returned a verdict, that her death was caused by<br>hte violence she received from the Reverend John Carroll; who has been committed to<br>Wexford Jail; but as his insanity is undoubted, he cannot be capitally punished.<p>R. Husband, Printer, 15. Princes Street.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  </p>
