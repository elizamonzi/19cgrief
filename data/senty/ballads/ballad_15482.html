	<h2>Transcription</h2>
	<p> An Account  of the Execution of ANDAREW <p>FULLARTON,who suffered at Edinburgh,<br>on Wednesday the 16th August, 1826,<br>for Highway Robbery, between Edin-<br>burgh and Dalkeith, on the 18th April<br>last, with his last Dying Confession,<br>and Behaviour on the Scaffold.<p>EDINBURGH, 16th August, 1826.?This mor-<br>ning, at nine o'clock, ANDREW FULLAR-<br>TON, Late quarrier in this neighbourhood, was<br>Executed here, at the head of Libberton Wynd,<br>Lawnmarket, far Highway Robbery, committed by<br>brutally assaulting James Hunter, cow-feeder, St.<br>L'eonard's, near Edinburgh, on the road betwixt<br>Edinburgh and Dalkeith, on his return from Lauder<br>fair, in company with two women, whom he met<br>on the road, and robbing him of nearly Eleven<br>Pounds, an umbrella, and neckcloth, on the night<br>of the 18th April last, along with two other men.<p>Soon after this crime was thus committed, Ful-<br>larton and Renton, a labourer, were apprehended, on<br>suspicion of being two of the persons concerned,<br>Reid, who was also supposed to be the third man,<br>having made his escape. He has been apprehended<br> since, however, and is now in Jail. On the 14th of<br>July last,Renton and Fullarton were tried before<br>the High Court of Justiciary on this charge. The<br>evidence as to the circumstances of the assault,<br> which appeared to have been a very brutal one, was<br>stated with great minuteness by Mr Hunter; and<br>he was corroborated in every respect by the two<br>females who were present, one of whom identified<br>Fullarton as one of those who committed the crime,<br>After several other witnesses were examined, and<br>the evidence summed up, the Jury returned a ver-<br>dict, unanimously finding Fullarton Guilty, and<br>the libel not proven against Renton. He, after a<br>proper admonition, was dismissed from the bar ;<br>and Fullerton, after a feeling and impressive address<br>from the Lord Justice Clerk, who urged him to lay-<br>aside any hope that the last sentence of the law<br>would not be carried into effect, was sentenced to<br>be execuled here on the 16th of August, between<br>3 and 10 forenoon. He displayed the greatest for-<br>titude during the trial, and even when the awful<br>sentence was pronouncing ; but his wife, who was<br>present, gave vent to her feelings in the most heart-<br>rending cries.<p>After his condemnation, Fullarton, we&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;heard,<br>behaved every way becoming his  awful situation.<br>Acknowledged his guilt, and the justice of his sen-<br>tence.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Regretted exceedingly his committing the<br>crime for which he suffered, and ascribed it solely<br>to the influence of drink  and  bad company.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He<br>urged, even on the scaffold, the propriety of people,<br>particularly young people, keeping good company,<br>avoiding  Sabbath-breaking,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and  drunkenness,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;as<br>these were invariably the causes that led to the<br>committal of every other crime.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He appea red, de-<br>cently dressed, on the  scaffold, shortly after eight<br>o'clock, where a considerable time was spent in re-<br>ligious exercises ; and then, after cordially bidding<br>farewell to all  around  him, he  mounted the fatal<br>drop.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While the executioner was adjusting the ap-<br>paratus of death, he was observed in most fervent<br>prayer for several minutes, after which he dropt the<br>signal, and was instantly launched into that world<br>from which no traveller returns, amidst a vast con-<br>course of spectators, about nine o'clock.<p>The sole purpose of the law, in punishing crimes,<br>being, " to deter others from committing the like<br>in all time coming," the example made here to-day,<br>of a handsome young man, said formerly to be of<br>a good moral character, only 26 years of age, being<br>cut off, by an ignominious death, from all he held<br>dear on earth, for the paltry consideration of a;few<br>shillings, surely ought to operate deeply on the<br>minds and conduct of all who witnessed it, and ef-<br>fectually prevent the like from occurring again  in<br>our day and generation.<p>Printed for the Booksellers in Town and Country.</p>
