	<p> SPEECH, Consession, and dying Words of J A M E S  D I C K,  who was <br>[?] at Glasgow on Wednesday the 16th of May 1792, and his Body given to the<br>[Tor?] of Anatomy to be dissected, For the horrid and cruel murder of his own Wife. <p><p>The&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;following is the  genuine Last Speech of James Dick, wrote with his own hand, and as it  exceeds<br>the bounds it a commn speech, the remainder will be given in another paper,  with what further may&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>occur.--If any other Speech appears, it is Forged, False, and an imposition on the Public.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<p>I&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;JAMES DICK,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;aged about  32 years,<br>born in the city of Edinburgh, of honest and<br>creditable parents, who gave  me such education<br>as was necessary for a tradesman  in my station,<br>but my father dying when I was very young, I<br>was obliged to do for myself as soon as possible ;<br>at the age of twelve I went to learn to be a shoe-<br>maker with an uncle of my own, with  whom I<br>seved about two years and an half, then I be-<br>[] a Journeyman, and got money before  I<br>[] well what to do with it ; by which I soon<br>[] with too many companions, and my own<br>[] which I reflect greatly of now,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;when I<br>[] folly, for they are all heinous fins in the<br>[] of God, although I did not see so before,<br>[] have come all into my mind since I was<br>[]demned.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On purpose to get quite of my bad<br>[]mpanions, and to leave off that wicked life that<br>[]ving, I went&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to Haddington to&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;work,<br>[]as doing tolerably well for some time, until<br>[] of the  80th regiment,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;or Edinburgh<br>[]nteers came to Haddington to recruit, when<br>and my comerade enlisted with them,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;when<br>[] came in to Edinburgh and stayed with them a<br>considerable time, until I was going  to be  sent<br>[]e onboard some of his Majesty's ships,<br>[]ds getting word of it, (for I refused to<br>[]arine) and my friends and the Provost<br>of Edinburgh got me my discharge.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  Then I<br>settled at my work for some time in Edinburgh,<br>but still kept too much company, especially with<br>[]g women, which I reflect greatly at now<br>too late i I took a thought of what a course<br>I was living, and was resolved to drop it<br>[] on purpose to get quite  of it,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I left Edin-<br>burgh and came to Glasgow in the month of<br>[] 1775, where I wrought and behaved sober-<br>[] and honestly until the month of September,<br>when I fell in with Isabel Russel in a public house<br>in the Trongate where I was lodged,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and her<br>and I carried on a correspondence together till<br>the month of December, when I went to Paisley<br>[] work, and in eight days after she came to me<br>when her and I stayed together till the month of<br>May in the year 1776, when I took a thought of<br>what I was doing, and what fort of life I  was<br>leading, which caused me often take a serious<br>thought of what I was about, I resolved to leave<br>her, which I did and went to Kilmarnock, where<br>I stayed about six weeks before any  body knew<br>where I was, but my master in Paisley made en-<br>quiry and found me out, on account I owed him<br>bout L. 2. : 10 : o sterl. and he came to me and<br>wanted me back or pay him the money  which I<br>owed him or go to prison ; but I refused either<br>to go back or go to prison, but sent for my ma-<br>ster that I wrought with in Kilmarnock,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;who<br>advanced the money for me, but my old master<br>had no sooner returned to Paisley than he told my<br>wife where I was, altho' he made both oaths and<br>promises not to tell her, he was not eight&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;days<br>gone till she came to me, and  I did  not know<br>what to do for I had no place to put her up  in,<br>and I was tired of her by that time, for I  had<br>some other women in Kilmarnock, & I thought<br>it was impossible to keep company with them all,<br>but I staid that night with her, and advised her<br>to go for her clothes, which she did, and in the<br>mean time I was  resolved to leave Kilmarnock<br>before she returned, but I thought it would be a<br>great crime to leave my master, and owing him<br>the money he had advanced for me, so I resolved<br>to stay until I paid him : she came up to me again<br>and we staid together till I paid my master ; then<br>I resolved to leave her again,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;for  I  could not<p>think of being so close consined to one woman as<br>she would have me, for she had such a regard<br>for me that she could never want me out of her<br>company, but I rather liked at [],  to be with<br>other company, so in the month or December I<br>thought of leaving her, (with the advice of a bad<br>companion that wrought in the shop with me who<br>stirred me up against her often when I would not<br>have been so,) so I left her again and went to<br>Dumfries, where I staid for some time, and she<br>thought that I had gone for Edinburgh, and<br>went there after me to my relations, who used her<br>very badly on account of a letter that was sent<br>them concerning her following me, which put<br>her in the, worst light that could possibly be men-<br>tioned, by this bad companion who wrought in<br>the shop with me. She staid some days with<br>them and got word where I was, and came to<br>Dumfriess after me but I had left Dumfries and<br>gone to Annan to wait upon'a vessel to take me<br>to Ireland or Whitehaven in England, but she<br>got word of me in Dumfries, and came directly<br>to Annan, and got me at my work, and I was<br>very glad to see her, for I rued fore I had left<br>her: her and I staid sometime there, and she<br>advised me to go home to Edinburgh, which her<br>and I did in the year 1778, and staid there till<br>December 1789, during which time her and I<br>lived very comfortably together, only when I<br>staid too long out from her, for her heart was<br>so much bound up in me, that if I had been half<br>an hour out of her company she was like a fish<br>out of the water about me; there was for several<br>years that her and I did as well as any two could<br>do in the world; we both attended the church<br>for several years and every thing that was right<br>went well with us, till about fix or seven years<br>ago, when she fell into a way of drinking, which<br>caused me often to have words with her, and<br>through passion run out and fell into too much<br>company, especially young women, which I re-<br>flect greatly at now ; for no sooner had I gained<br>their favour, and them coming after me,  but I<br>fell a laughing at them to see their foolishness,<br>in believing every thing I told them, but they<br>may laugh at me now. I was so much led away<br>with women and gambling, that I was many a<br>week not above three or four nights in my own<br>bed, to my great loss and shame this day, for<br>that way of spending my life, it stares me in the<br>face now when too late; if I had but had half<br>the regard for my wife she had for me I would<br>not have done so. I carried on that life till<br>December 1789, when her and I took a thought<br>of what we were about, and I told her that she<br>was driving me into despair,and she had the cause<br>of the ruin of both my soul and body ; she pro-<br>mifed faithfully to leave off drinking, and I told<br>her if she would leave it off I would take her to<br>Glasgow among her own relations, to which<br>place we came in December 1789, when her and<br>I settled for some time, but she could not refrain<br>from whisky, and was often the worse of it, which<br>caused me often to fly in a passion at her when I<br>did not intend it, for I could not see her the<br>worse of drink, for when either man or woman<br>is the worse of drink they are easily imposed on,<br>especially women.<p>In this course of time that we have been to-<br>gether she has born me six children, which are<br>all dead, thank God for it.<p>(Signed) JAMES DICK<br>JOHN M'DOUGAL, Inner Turn-key witness <p>[To be Continued]<p>G L A S G O W ; Printed by J.
