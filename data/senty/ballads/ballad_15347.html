	<p> Trial<p>And Sentence.<p>Account of the Trial and Sentence of<br>John Wright, and James Nichol,<br>for breaking into Merchiston castle,<br>for which Wright is sentenced to be<br>executed at Edinburgh, on Wednes<br>the 16th day of April next. and NI<br>col banished.<p>This day, (Thursday, 13th March,1823,) came on before the<br>High Court of Justiciary, the Trial of John Wright, and  Nicol,<br>accused of breaking into Merchiston Castle at the head of<br>Bruntsfield Links, in the month of December last.<p>Wright pled Not Guilty, Nicol pled Guilty.<p>The principal witnesses were Mr and Mrs Yule, who live at<br>the lodge of the castle, and both identified the prisoners as<br>those whom they had seen at the castle on the day of the rob-<br>bery. Mr Yule had left the castle in a secure state about 2 in<br>the afternoon, and on returning at 4 he found the property in<br>the house in an altered state, several articles being packed up<br>evidently for the purpose of being carried away. He also met<br>with the prisoners on the premises, and collared Nicol ; upon<br>which Wright swore an oath and called upon Nicol to draw a<br>knife and stab witness. Nicol placed his hand on his breast for<br>the purpose of drawing a knife, where upon witness let him go.<br>The prisoners made their escape, but one of them left his hat.<p>A police officer apprehended the prisoners the same evening<br>in the Crassmarket<p>The jury returned a verdict finding both panuels Guilty.<br>The public prosecutor restricted the law in the case of Nicol.<p>The cries of Wright imploring for mercy prevented the Lord<br>Justice Clerk from prououncing sentence for some minutes.<br>There were some females in Court who were deeply affected.<p>The Lord Juslice Clerk, amidst the cries and lamentattons<br>of the prisoner, proceeded to pass the last sentence of the law<br>on him ; which was, that he be Executed at Edinburgh, on the<br>16th of April. His Lordship then sentenced Nicol to be<br>transported beyond seas for life, and trusted that the scene he<br>had just witnessed would impress on his mind the awfulness of<br>the precipice he had so narrowly escaped.<p>Wright is a fine looking young man, seemingly about 20<br>years of age.<p>PRICE ONE PENNY.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
