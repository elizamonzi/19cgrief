	<h2>Transcription</h2>
	<p> A FULL & PARTICULAR ACCOUNT OF THE<p>EXECUTION<p>OF<p>Robert Tennant,<p>Who was Executed at Stirling on Wednesday morning,<br>the 2d of October, for the bloody Murder of William<br>Peddie, an old man, about 70 years of age, on the high<br>road between Beancross and Kerse toll, parish of Fal-<br>l-irk, on the evening of the 3d of August last, with his<br>Speech upon the scaffold, also a copy of his Lamenta-<br>tion.<p>ROBERT TENNANT is a young man about 24 years of age,<br>was a labourer, and employed in breaking stones on the Toll<br>Road, between Beancross and Kerse Toll, in the parish of Falkirk,<br>when the unfortunate circumstances of the murder took place..?<br>William Peddie, the deceased was about 70 years old, a labourer<br>also, and likewise employee on the same road, on which he was<br>foreman. On the forenoon of the 3d of August, the day on which<br>the murder was committed, Peddie was instructed to dismiss Ten-<br>aant from the work, by Mr. Borthwick, the superintendant of that<br>district of road, because that, although the deceased had before pre-<br>vailed on the superintendnnt to keep him on the road, it was evi-<br>dent that his drinking and irregularity rendered him unfit to be<br>longer employed, and had been at that moment, 12 o'clock noon,<br>lying drunk on the footpath, opposite the Toll, apparently fast<br>asleep. When he awoke, and this instruction was communicated<br>to him, the altercation commenced, which ended in the murder of<br>the poor old man.<p>About eight o'clock on Wednesday morning the Magistrates as<br>sembled in the Court -House, shottly after which the prisoner was<br>brought forward, and after a short time spent in devotional exer-<br>oise, and after singing a few verses of the 50th psalm, he proceed-<br>ed to the scaffold about 20 minutes past 8 o'clock, when after i<br>very impressive and ferent prayer by the Rev. A Bennie, during<br>which he bowed repeatedly, he was led to the drop, and after a few<br>seconds spent in prayer, he gave the signal, when he was launched<br>into eternity. He was decently dressed in black. There were about<br>2000 spectators present.<p>Ye fellow man, pray view the end,<p>Of those who live in crime,<br>they range abroad without a friend;<p>And die before their time,<br>the dreadful scaffold does unfold<p>A lesson to the young;<br>It paints in Language seldom told,<p>That crime will stop the tongue.<p>When pinioned fast, the awful view,<p>Does damp the prisoner's heart,<br>But little thought spectators take,<p>It leaves no lasting smart.<br>Farewell, my friends, we now must sever,<p>The thought lies heavy at my heart,<br>Forget my awful end for ever,<p>I from you now must part.</p>
