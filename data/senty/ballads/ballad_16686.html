	<p> LOCHIEL'S&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;WARNING.<p>(NEW&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;VERSION.)<br>Respectfully Dedicated to the Electors of Inverness-shire.<p>W I Z A R D.<p>LOCHIEL ! LOCHIEL ! beware of the day<br>When Sir Kenneth shall meet you in battle array ;<br>The close of the struggle looms clear on my sight,<br>And the ranks of the Tories are scattered in flight.<br>The " Peace with Honour " bluster loudly they sound,<br>And boast of annexing the countries all round ;<br>But the voters won't listen to big blatant strains,<br>And the flag of Sir Kenneth waves free o'er the plains.<p>L O C H I E L.<p>Go preach to the coward thy tidings of gloom !<br>Knowest not, that the Cameron's Her Majesty's groom ?<br>But, " By Jingo," in case that thy vision comes true,<br>I'll send for some faggots to Father Buccleuch.<p>W I Z A R D.<p>Ah, laughest thou, Loehiel, my vision to scorn !<br>Fond hope of the Tories, thy wings shall be shorn !<br>Too soon in the fight shall thy proud spirit quail,<br>When opposed by Sir Kenneth, the friend of the Gael.<br>At his fair manly views how our hearts swell with pride,<br>Whilst your arrogant claims we can only deride.<br>By abuse and insult you can ne'er hope to win,<br>Or to tell you support the notorious John Dunn.<br>I tell you, Lochiel, you may stand in your might,<br>But You hinder the progress of reason and right;<br>Your great love for fanners they know is a ruse,<br>Since it blooms of a sudden, when Kenneth they choose ;<br>The great Chief of Gairloch they trust without fear?<br>He will ne'er change his farms into forests for deer ;<br>But thou, Oh Lochiel, were thy politics right,<br>Thy flag would be still on our battlement height ;<br>But now every hill top with embers do burn<br>From bonfires that tell of Sir Kenneth's return.<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;L O C H I E L.<p>False Wizard, avaunt !&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have marshalled my clan,<br>With coaxing and threatening they'll plump to a man,<br>Bound down by the factors, they don't rightly guess<br>They can vote as they please without losing their lease.<p>Then welcome be Kenneth's array to the shock,<br>He will find that my seat is as firm as a rock ;<br>But woe to his vaunting, and woe to his cause,<br>Hypothec won't help him, or yet the Game Laws,<br>When forth goes the scum of the great Tory tribe?<br>Moll'son the upstart, and Innes the scribe,<br>All paid by the " Fund " at five guineas a-day??<p>W I Z A R D.<p>? Lochiel, Lochiel !  in vain you may bray,<br>And 'gainst the great Gladstone your noddle array ;<br>But your facts and your figures are grossly untrue,<br>No matter how deftly you bring them to view ;<br>Your pet rule of three is, War, Wanton, and Waste,<br>Till our commerce is ruined, our good name disgraced ;<br>While Europe is chuckling, and pointing with scorn<br>At this Jew-ridden nation, now bleeding and torn.<br>But the Liberals are armed, and thy cause is undone,<br>Though perchance you may bask in the Beaconsfield sun,<br>Even he, the " Immaculate's," reign will be o'er,<br>And Peace come with Plenty to bide on our shore.<p>L O C H I E L .<p>Down, daring insulter !&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I trust not thy tale,<br>For ne'er shall my party a destiny meet<br>So black with dishonour, such a signal defeat.<br>I admit that our farmers of hard times complain :<br>But success crown'd our arms in the Afghan campaign:<br>You say that our prisons with bankrupts are filled :<br>What of that! let's remember the Zulus we killed !<br>'Tis true that our soldiers lie strew'n in their gore,<br>Through our mania for plunder, on many a shore.<br>Still, things might be worse ! and we hope yet to steer<br>Back to power on an ocean of publican beer.<br>Besides, by the favour of mighty Buccleuch,<br>Fair hopes of the peerage oft rise to my view.<br>But should Gairloch win, and my plume be laid low,<br>The loss of my pension will be a sad blow ;<br>And having no longer M.P. to my name,<br>Farewell to the " Groomship," and farewell to fame.</p>
