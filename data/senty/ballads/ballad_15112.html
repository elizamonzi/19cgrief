	<p> Flying Trapeze.<p>PRICE ONE PENNY.<p>Copies of this very popular long can always be had<br>in the Poet's Box, <p>AIR?Original.<p>Once I was happy, but now I'm forlorn,<br>Like an old coat that is tattered and torn,<br>Left on this wide world to fret and to mourn,<br>Betrayed by a maid in her teens.<br>The girl that I loved she was handsome,<br>I tried all I knew her to please,<br>But I could not please her one quarter so well<br>As that man upon the trapeze.<p>CHORUS.<p>He'd fly thro' the air with the greatest of ease?<br>A daring young man on the Hying trapeze?<br>His movements were graceful, all girls he could please,<br>And my love he purloined away.<p>This young man by name was Signor Bon Slang,<br>Tall, big, and handsome, as well made as Chang,<br>Where'er he appeared the hall loudly rang<br>With ovations from all people there.<br>He'd smile from the bar on the people below,<br>And one night he smiled on my love,<br>She winked back at him and she shouted " Bravo,"<br>As he hung by his nose up above.<p>Her father and mother were both on my side.<br>And very hard tried to make her my own bride,<br>Her father ho sighed, and her mother she cried,<br>To see her throw herself away.<br>'Twas all of no avail, she went there every night,<br>And would throw him bouquets on the stage,<br>That caused him to meet her, how he ran me down,<br>To tell you would take a whole page.<p>One night, as usual, I went to her home,<br>Found there her father and mother alone,<br>I asked for my love, and soon they made known<br>To my horror she'd run away.<br>She'd packed up her box and eloped in the night<br>With him with the greatest of ease,<br>From two stories high he had lowered her down<br>To the ground on his flying trapeze.<p>Some months after this I went to a hall,<br>Was greatly surprised to see on the wall<br>A bill in red letters, which did my heart gall,<br>That she was appearing with him.<br>He taught her gymnastics and dress'd her in tights,<br>To help him to live at his ease,<br>And made her assume a masculine name,<br>And now she goes on the trapeze.<p>CHORUS.<p>She floats thro' the air with the greatest of ease,<br>You'd think her a man on the flying trapeze,<br>She does all the work, while he takes his ease,<br>And that's what's become of my love.<p>Saturday, July 11,  1874.</p>
