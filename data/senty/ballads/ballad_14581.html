	<p> Murderous  Outrage<br>IN FIFE!<p>A Full and Particular Account of that most Murder-<br>ous Outrage that was committed on the body of<br>George M'Donald, a flax-dresser belonging to<br>Dundee, by a person of the name of Robert Dems-<br>ter, a plasterer and slater from Cupar.<p>George M'Donald, a flax-dresser, belonging to Dundee, who has<br>for a considerable time been unable to follow his occupation, owing<br>to his having received a shock of the palsy about a fortnight ago,<br>left Dundee, and went to Dysart on a visit to his sister, who resides<br>in the latter place. He set out from Dysart last Wednesday mor-<br>ning, purposing to return to Dundee, and get a ride in a cart as far<br>as Craigrothie. Being, as he says, (for this statement is from his<br>own mouth,) very cold, he went into a public-house kept by a per-<br>son of the name of Cooper, and asked for half a gill of whisky. He<br>was shown into a room, where one Robert Demster, a plasterer and<br>slater from Cupar, waa sitting, and immediately engaged in conver-<br>sation. After having finished their whisky, they set out together,<br>purposing to go to Ceres ; when about half way to Ceres, and al-<br>most opposite Weymss Hall gate, Demster asked M'Donold for the<br>loan of a sixpence, and assured him he would get it when he got<br>to Cupar, alleging as a reason for this request, that] he had been<br>long out of employment, and was very scarce of money. M'Don-<br>ald said he was a poor man and had no money. Demster then<br>said, " Oh, I saw you have plenty of money when we were in<br>Craigrothie." M'Donald then said I am thinking I will be surer of<br>my money if I keep it in my pocket. Demster then said, " If you<br>do not give me it I will knock you down," and held up his ham-<br>mer (a slater's hammer) in a menacing manner. M'Donald then<br>said, you surely dinna intend to strike me with that." " Perhaps<br>I will, replied Demster. M'Donald getting alarmed, cried out<br>" you surely do not intend to murder me." " Yes I do," was the<br>answer, he sprung on him and inflicted repeated blows with<br>the hammer onhis head. Perceiving, however, two females coming<br>up, he pushed the body into a ditch and fled, throwing his ham-<br>mer over the wall, into one of the Parks adjoining to Wemyss<br>Hall. The ladies, when they came up, observed the unfortunate<br>man, and endeavoured to lift him, but were unable to do so. They<br>however, soon obtained assistance, and the unfortunate man was<br>carried to house in Ceres kept by one Ellen Howie, where he-now<br>lies in a very dangerous state, with very little prospect of his re-<br>covery.<p>" Mrs Cooper, who keeps the public house in Craigrothie, says,<br>that they were both nearly drunk, and that when they left her<br>house, Demster was intending to go to Cupar, and M'Donald to<br>Ceres. Another person who passed the two on the road, says, that<br>when she passed them were quarrelling about something, but can-<br>not say what it was about. It is reported that Demster, after pe-<br>petrating the deed, hastened to Cupar, went to the Jail, and told<br>the Jailor to take him in, as he had mundered a man. The Jailor,<br>however, told he could not take him in without a warrant. Dem-<br>ster then went to his friends, and having taken a second thought<br>made his escape, and has not since been heard of. Placards are,<br>however, posted up through the whole country, and there is little<br>doubt of his apprehensson. M'Donald is a poor lame object; he<br>was bred a flax-dresser a few miles south from Edinburgh, and fol-<br>lowed this occupation until he sustained a stroke of the palsy<br>which has deprived him of the power of the whole of his left side<br>and arm. He usuelly resides iu Dundee, and receives five shillings<br>per week from a fund in that town."<p>Price One Penny.<p></p>
