GULLEN,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Witnesses.<p>ARCHD. DUNBAR, <p>*** I hope none will be so unkind as<br>to make the cause of my death a ground<br>of reproach to my beloved wife, or inno-<br>cent children,<p>He behaved at the place of execution<br>in every respect becoming his awful situa-<br>tion, and met his fate with firmness.<p>Edinburgh - Printed by J.
