tried<br>Who should wander the ruins about.<p>" I myself, like a schoolboy, should tremble to hear<p>The hoarse ivy shake over my head:<br>And could fancy I saw, half pursued by my fear,<br>Some ugly old abbot's white spirit appear,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <p>For this wind might awaken the dead."<p>" I'll wager a dinner," the other one cried,<br>" That Mary' would venture there now;"<br>" Then wager and lose," with a sneer he replied,<br>" I'11 warrant she'd fancy a ghost by her side,<br>And faint if she saw a white cow."<p>"Will Mary this charge on her courage allow?"<p>His companion exclaim'd with a smile;<br>" I shall win, for I know she will venture there now,<br>And earn a new bonnet by bringing a bough<p>From the alder that grows in the aisle."<p>With fearless good humour did Mary comply,<p>And her way to the;abbey she bent;<br>The. night it was gloomy, the wind it was high,<br>And, as hollowly howling it swept through the sky,<p>She shiver'd with cold as she went.<p>O'er the path, so well known, still proceeded the maid,<p>Where the abbey rose dim at her sight;<br>Through the gateway she enter'd, she felt not afraid,<br>Yet the ruins were lonely and wild, and their shade'.<p>Seem'd to deepen the gloom of the night.<p>All around her was silent, save when the rude blast<p>Howl'd dismally round the old pile;<br>Over weed-covered fragments still fearless she pass'd,<br>And arriv'd at the innermost ruin at last,<p>Where the alder-tree grew in the aisle.<p>Well pleas'd did she reach it, and quickly drew near.<br>And hastily gather'd a bough,<p>She paus'd, and she listen'd, all eager to hear,<br>And her heart panted fearfully now.<p>The wind blew, the hoarse ivy shook over her head ;?<p>She listen'd;?nought else could she hear:<br>The wind ceas'd; her heart sunk in her bosom with dread,<br>For she heard in the ruins distinctly the tread<br>Of footsteps approaching her near.<p>Behind a wide column, half breathless with fear,<p>She crept to conceal herself there:<br>That instant the moon o'er a dark cloud shone clear,<br>And she saw in the moonlight two ruffians appear,<p>And between them a corse they did bear.<p>Then Mary could feel her heart's blood curdle cold,<p>Again the rough wind hurried by-<br>It blew off the hat of the one, and behold,<br>Even close to the feet of poor Mary it roll'd:<p>She fell?and expected to die.<p>" Curse the hat!"?he exclaim'd?" nay, come on and<br>first hide<p>The dead body," his comrade replies.<br>She beheld them in safety pass on by her side,<br>She seizes the hat, fear her courage supplied,<p>As fast through the abbey she flies.<p>She ran with wild speed, she rush'd in at the door,<p>She cast her eyes horribly round;<br>Her limbs could support their faint burden no more;<br>But, exhausted and breathless, she sunk on the floor.<p>Unable to utter a sound.<p>Ere yet the pale lips could the story impart,<p>For a moment the hat met her view:<br>Her eyes from that object convulsively start,<br>For, oh God !what cold horrors thrill'd thro' her heart<p>When the name of her Richard she knew !<p>Where the old abbey stands on a common hard by,<p>His gibbet is now to be seen;<br>Not far from the inn it engages the eye,  <br>The trav'ller beholds it, and thinks, with a sigh,<p>Of poor Mary, the maid of the inn.<p>The POET is universally admitted to be the Cheapest<br>LETTERPRESS PRINTER in the City.
