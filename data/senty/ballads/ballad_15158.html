	<p> A Full and Particular Account of the Trial and Sen-<br>tence of GEORGE LAIDLAW, who is to be Executed<br>at Glasgow, on Wednesday the 29th of October,<br>1823, for the crime of Housebreaking and Theft.<p>ON Friday the 26th September, 1823, at Glasgow, before the<br>Circuit Court of Justiciary, came on the Trial of GEORGE<br>LAIDLAW, and GEORGE SPITTAL or SPITTEL, charged with<br>having, on the morning of the 30th March, 1823, broken into the<br>shop of Messrs Solomon and Hadkins, jewellers, Nelson Street, by<br>means of false keys, and stolen a number of gold and silver<br>watches, keys, seals, rings, snuff boxes, a coral necklace, breast pins,<br>and other articles of jewellery ; Laidlaw pleaded Not Guilty, Spit-<br>tal,Guilty.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <p>Moses Solomon, being of the Jewish persuasion, was sworn with<br>the Old Testament in his hand, and his hat on.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I am a partner in<br>the firm of Solomon and Hadkins.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I recollect of the shop being<br>broken into on the 29th March.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I that night locked the door, and<br>secured the window on the night previous.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I tried the locks seve-<br>ral times before I left the door.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The jewellery was all in the glass<br>cases, but the watches had been taken out of the window, and put<br>into a desk, which was locked up.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I got information that the shop<br>was broken on the evening of the 30th.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I went straight to it, and<br>there I found Brown the policeman and several people in it.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The<br>shop was stript of jewellery and watches, except some small articles<br>which had been lying about.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The door was open, but the clasp<br>was on the door, and the padlock was on the clasp, so that the door<br>had the appearance of security.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I made out an inventory of the<br>goods stolen on that occasion, and I am quite certain they were in<br>the shop the night before.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The whole value of the articles stolen<br>would run upwards of £600...that is from 6 to £700.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; About<br>three weeks before the robbery, Laidlaw used to come frequently<br>about the shop.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Donald M'Donald brought a seal to my shop,<br>which I  instantly recognized as my property.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; These seals are part<br>of the property stolen.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I saw a small part of the stolen property in<br>the shop of Crookshanks.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (Here the witness identified a number<br>of the articles stolen, and stated that they were referred  to in the<br>inventories.)<p>Henry Savage, shopboy to Solomon and Hadkins. I have seen<br>Laidlaw in the shop. He used to come when I had got the door<br>opened, and he would lift the keys and tell me to put them past.<br>About a month before the shop was broken into I met Laidlaw<br>near the Post-office. I had the key of the door and the key of the<br>padlock. He came forward and asked to see if my key would an-<br>swer his warehouse. Laidlaw took my key up two or three stairs<br>in Bnchannan Court. I went up a part of the  stair, and I met<br>Laidlaw coming down again. He was not long away. When he<br> came down he said the key would fit his door, and he told me to<br>come away with him and buy a key the same. We went into the<br>shop of M'Callum in the Saltmarket, and he got a key just the<br>same. I got my own key, and went to the shop. About a week<br>afterwards he got the padlock of  the shop door itself from me. He<br>said he wanted it to ascertain what he would pay for one of the<br>same size. I gave him the padlock, and he had it away about a<br>quarter of an hour.<p>Mary Drummond.---I was going from Glasgow to Greenock one<br>day in a steam-boat. I saw Laidlaw there. He began to converse<br> with me. He had a broad ring on his finger, and I asked a look<br>of it. A gentleman put it one my finger, and said by the way of<br>a joke " Miss, it suits your finger very well."  I kept it a little,<br>and when I offered it back to Laidlaw, he refused it, and I kept it till<br>I heard of his apprehension, and I took it to Mr Solomon's shop.<br>I saw a watch and seals on that occasion, but I cannot say those<br>are them.<p>David Stewart, shopman to Crookshanks, Saltmarket, I recollec-<br>ted of hearing of the robbery of Solomon's shop. I know Laidlaw.<br>He came and sold some articles of jewellery in our shop to my<br>master after the robbery, while I was present. These are the arti-<br>cles. There was a search made afterwards, and all the articles we<br>got from Laidlaw were taken off.<p>The declarations of the pannels were then read, Laidlaw stated<br>that the robbery of the shop was planed and executed by him and<br>Spittal alone. The Jury gave in an unanimous verdict, finding<br>Laidlaw Guilty, and Spittal Guilty in terms of his own confession.<p>After an impressive admonition from Lord Hermand, Laidlaw,<br>was sentenced to be executed on the 29th October, and Spittal is to<br>be transported for life.  His Lordship strongly advised the pannel<br>Laidlaw to make the most of the short time he was to remain on<br>this earth, for there was not the least hope of Royal mercy being<br>extended unto him.<p>Edinburgh : Printed for Allan Grant....Price One Penny.</p>
