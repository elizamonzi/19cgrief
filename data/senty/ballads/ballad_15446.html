	<p> Confession of James Bryce.'<p>I am a poor unhappy man, James Bryce it is my name,<br>I murdered my brother in-law, I may tell it with shame;<br>I for the same in Edinburgh the 12th of March was tried<br>But the charge against me there I solemnly denied.<p>When my trial it came on it's guilty I was found,<br>I then was taken back to jail and in strong irons bound,<br>Now on the third day of April I am doomed to die,<br>Since I am condemned, my friends, the truth I'll not deny.<p>John Geddes was a man for whom I had a great respect,<br>To relieve me in time of need he never did neglect;<br>At Blaw Wearie in West Calder, he dwelt in a lonely cot,<br>'Twas three pounds on a watch from him I lately got.<p>Geddes and I at labouring did work many a day,<br>He never thought I was the man would take his life away,<br>It's known my brother-in-law and I never were at strife,<br>It's eighteen years and more since I took his sister to wife.<p>The twenty-sixth of December to West Calder I went,<br>It s for to rob my brother-in-law it was my whole intent;<br>When I came unto his house, admittance soon I got,<br>I said I wanted money, but give it he would not.<p>From angry words it came to blows, don't murder me he said,<br>With that I seized a pair of tongs that stood by the fireside,<br>I did leave him a lifeless corps there stretched on the floor,<br>I robbed him of what he had and then made fast the door.<p>From West Calder to Airdrie town I did take my way,<br>I was there I safely did arrive by nine o'clock next day ;<br>When I sat down by the fireside the watches I did show,<br>My son cries that's my uncle's watch, the ribbon I do know.<p>When the news of the murder arrived in Airdrie,<br>I heard some of the neighbours did leave the blame on me,<br>I sent my wife to Glasgow town next morning by the dawn,<br>One of the watches instantly 'twas for me she did pawn.<p>I roved about from town to town, in no place could I dwell,<br>My crime it was so horrible my conscience felt an hell;<br>Every day I was in dread they'd take me by surprise,<br>So I cut off my whiskers thinking myself to disguise.<p>On, the twelfth of January I arrived  in Damfries,<br>In Maxwelltown I was taken that day by the police ;<br>While I was lying in my bed I was a prisoner made,<br>I was bound in irons and to Edinburgh conveyed.<p>Now till the third of April in chains I here must lie.<br>For it is on that day my friends I am doomed to die;<br>The murder of my brother-in-law I rue when it's too late,<br>Let every one take warning now by my untimely fate.<p>When Cain his brother Abel siew he thought it very odd.<br>To be banished from his friends off to the land of Nod.<br>But O my friends I fear there is no banishment for me;<br>A few days more and I'll be launched into eternity.<p></p>
