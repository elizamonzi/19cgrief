	<p> TRIAL AND SENTENCE.<p>A Full and Particular Account of the Trial and Sentence of THOMAS BRAID<br>and MARY BRAID or MORISON, Brother and Sister-german, who were<br>tried yesterday (Monday), before the High Court of Justiciary, for INCEST<br>and MURDER, and who are, Mary Braid or Morison to be Executed on<br>Monday the 17th February, and her body to be buried within the precincts<br>of the Jail, and Thomas Braid to be Banished for Life.<p>ON Monday the 27th January, 1834, came on the ttial of THOMAS BRAID<br>and MARY BRAID or MORISON, brother and sister-german, accused of<br>Incest and Murder, both of which crimes are forbidden by the laws of God and<br>man. In the 18th chapter of Leviticus, incest is particularly forbidden, under<br>the severest denuncaitions ; and, in an act passed in the first Parliament of James<br>the Sixth, it is there statuted to be punishable to the death. The sixth com-<br>mandment says, " Thou shalt not kill ;" and, in another part of holy writ, it is<br>stated?" Whosoever sheddeth man's blood, by man his blood shall be shed,"<p>" Notwithstanding which, the libel charges the said Thomas Braid and Mary<br>Braid or Morison, both and each, or one or other of them, guilty of the said<br>crimes of incest and murder, or of one or other of them, actors or actor, or art<br>and part: in so far as, during the years 1832 and 1833, or part thereof, and at<br>various places within the county of Edinburgh, you the said Thomas Braid and<br>Mary Braid or Morison, being brother and sister-german as aforesaid, did wick-<br>edly and unlawfully carry on an incestuous intercourse with each other: In<br>particular, (1.) During the months of May, June, July, August, September, Octo-<br>ber, November and December, 1832, and January and February, 1833, or part<br>thereof, within the house at Stenhouse, in the parish of Libberton, and county<br>of Edinburgh, then occupied by Janet Begbie or Braid, your mother, or else-<br>where, to the prosecutor unknown, in the said parish of Libberton, or near vici-<br>nity, you the said Thomas Braid and Mary Braid or Morison, being brother<br>and sister-german as aforesaid, did wickedly and unlawfully carry on an inces-<br>tuous intercourse together, and did, on various occasions, during the said period,<br>abuse your bodies with each other; and, in consequence of the said incestuous<br>intercourse, you the said Mary Braid or Morison became pregnant, and were<br>thereafter delivered of a living female child, on or about the 10th day of April,<br>1833, within the house in the Canongate, in or near Edinburgh, then occupied<br>by Charity Anderson or Hardy, widow, then residing there, and now or lately<br>residing in Hill Place, in or near Edinburgh : Likeas, (2.) during the months of<br>March, April and May, 1833, or part thereof, within the house in Canongate<br>aforesaid, then occupied as aforesaid by the said Charity Anderson or Hardy,<br>you the said Thomas Braid and Mary Braid or Morison, being brother and sister-<br>german as aforesaid, did wickedly and unlawfully carry on an incestuous inter-<br>course with each other, and did cohabit together as husband and wife, and on<br>various occasions, during the said period, were there in naked bed together, and<br>did abuse your bodies with each other : Likeas, (3.) During the months of June,<br>July and August, 1833, or part thereof, within the house in the Canongate afore-<br>said, then occupied by you the said Thomas Braid and Mary Braid or Mori son,<br>or by one or other of you, you the said Thomas Braid and Mary Braid or Mori-<br>son, being brother and sister-german as aforesaid, did wickedly and unlawfully<br>carry on an incestuous intercourse with each other, and on various occasions,<br>during the said period, were there in naked bed together, and did abuse your<br>bodies with each other : Moreover, you the said Mary Braid or Morison, having,<br>on or about the 10th day of April, 1833, been delivered of a living female child,<br>of which you had become pregnant, in consequence as aforesaid, of the incestu-<br>ous intercourse above libelled, or in consequence of other carnal intercourse to<br>the prosecutor unknown, you the said Thomas Braid and Mary Braid or Mori-<br>son did, both and each, or one or other of you, upon the 16th day of August,<br>1833, or upon one or other of the days of that month or of July immediately<br>preceding, or of September immediately following, at or near to a part of the<br>Edinburgh and Glasgow Union Canal, near to the first stone-bridge on the said<br>Canal, as reckoned from Port-Hopetoun in or near Edinburgh, or at or near to<br>some other part of the said Canal betwixt Port-Hopetoun aforesaid and the second<br>stone-bridge on the said Canal, reckoned as aforesaid, or elsewhere, to the prose-<br>cutor unknown, in the county of Edinburgh, wickedly and felonicusly put to<br>death and murder the said child, by throwing it into the said Canal, having a<br>rope fastened round its neck, and a stone, or some other heavy substance, like-<br>wise attached to the said rope, for the purpose of sinking its body in the water,<br>and by leaving it there sunk accordingly, or by some other means to the prose-<br>cutor unknown ; and the dead body or the said child, which was murdered by<br>you the said Thomas Braid and Mary Braid or Morison, or by one or other of<br>you, was thereafter, on or about the 22d day of August, 1833, found floating in<br>the said Canal, near to the first stone-bridge aforesaid."<p>In support of these henious charges, thirty-six witnesses were adduced, but<br>the trial having proceeded with closed doors, we cannot, of course, state any par-<br>ticulars of the evidence. Some exculpatory witnesses were then examined, when<br>the Jury were addressed for the prosecution, by the Solicitor-General, and for<br>the prisoners, by Mr Monteith, at considerable length. The presiding Judge, Lord<br>Meadowbank, summed up the evidence, and the Jury found Mary Baird or<br>Morison, guilty, but the libel not proven against Thomas Braid. The former<br>was then sentenced to be executed on the morning of the 17th February next,<br>and her body to be buried within the precincts of the Jail,?the latter to be<br>banished beyond seas for the period of his natural life. This trial created a great<br>deal of interest, and lasted nearly eighteen hours.  [MENZIES, Printer.<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
