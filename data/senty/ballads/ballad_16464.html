	<p> THE CLERK of the PIPE.<p>Or, the Leith Reform Garland.<p>A NEW SONG.<br>TUNE?Down derry down.<p>The Clerk of the Pipe is a man of some weight.<br>And nothing will serve him but serving the state ;<br>And the State being rebuilt on a broad-bottom'd plan,<br>He has fairly set up for a Parliament-man.<br>Sing down down, down derry down.<p>He's a  gallant Reformer, and ever has been.<br>And abhors Sinecurists&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;as creatures unclean ;<br>Being bravely resolved, as he often has shewn,<br>To make war on all Sinecures - saving his own.<br>Sing down down, down derry down.<p>He's an Orator too,-tho' a copy, they say,<br>Of leather-lung'd Jacky, the member for Bray ;<br>And he'd fain be a wit,?tho' by some odd mischance.<br>It reminds one of Jacky just learning to dance.<br>Sing down down, down derry down.<p>But tho' dull to the eye, and more dull to the ear,<br>Tho' heavy in front, and most heavy in rear.<br>The path of ambition he still must pursue,<br>And exhibit his parts, Oh ! my country, to you!<p>  Sing down down, down derry down.<p><p>So with two or three Speeches got up with due care,<br>And two or three jokes somewhat worse for the wear;<br>And two or three friends, such as one might suppose,<br>In the good town of Leith he his nakedness shows,<p>Singing down, down,down derry down.  <p>In Leith then behold him discoursing at large,<br>Of all that has never been laid to his charge,<br>His contempt for the rich?his regard for the poor,?<br>But as to the Fact of his own sinecure,<p>Singingdown,down,down derry down.<p>Then, quoth he, " I not only must make my appeal.<br>" In behalf of myself, but of all that's genteel,<br>"For a mercantile town you will never degrade,<br>"By chusing a member that's risen by trade."<p>Sing down, down, down derry down.<p>Says a Voter, " all this may be good in its way,<br>But will you, my good sir, have the kindness to say,<br>How among the Reformers you thus should appear,<br>With your sinecure-place of six hundred a-year ?"<br>Sing down down, down derry down.<p>To this the poor Clerk never answer'd a word,<br>But look'd round in a way that was very absurd ;<br>And I merely will add, since his own mouth is shut,<br>If he went as The Pipe, he came back as The Butt.<p>Sing down down, down derry down.</p>
