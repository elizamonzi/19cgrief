	<p> Murders!<p>An Account of these two Murders, the one<br>committed, on Tuesday evening last,<br>the 5th September, 1826, on the Body<br>of Mrs ALEXANDER, residing at<br>the foot of Leith Wynd, Edinburgh,<br>by her own Husband; and the other,<br>last night, Monday the 11th September,<br>1826, on the Body of a young man of<br>the name of BAIN, a Hatter, in the<br>West Port, who was killed on the spot.<p>Edinburgh, 12th September, 1826.<br>Wa are sorry we have to record the following '<br>notice of two recent Murders, committed in this<br>city in the short space of a week, one of whom,<br>we are informed, is of a very aggravated nature.<br>We regret this the more, as, not withstanding re-<br>tent examples made, particularly that of William<br>Pollock, for the same crime, the murder of his<br>own wife, we find this dreadful, worst of all crimes,<br>on the increase in our native land.<p>We  copy  the  following from  the  Edinburgh:<br>Observer of this day:<p>TUESDAY night, a man of the name ALEX-<br> ANDER, residing in Leith Wynd, in a fit;<br>of passion stabbed his wife in the neck with a;<br>knife. The woman was taken to the Infirmary,<br>rat the wound was of so serious a nature, that she<br>died in a few hours. We understand that the<br>parties had frequent jars, which arose from jea-<br>lousy on the part of the wife. Alexander is now.<br>in custody.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ;<p>LAST NIGHT'S MURDER.<p>Last night, between nine and ten o'clock, an af-<br>fray took place at the West Port, which terminated<br>fataliy. From what we have been able to learn of<br>the affair, it would appear that as an old woman<br>and her son were going up the Port, a person of<br>the name of Bain, a hatter, accidentally came in<br>contact with the old woman, which caused her to<br>fall Her son was about to resent what he con-<br>sidered an insult offered to his mother. but she<br>was endeavouring to prevent him. when a flesher<br>came running out of an entry.exclaiming,..." Let<br>me to him, and  I'll do his business;" and imme-<br>diately knocked' Bain down, and killed him on the<br>spot.<p>At the time our informant left the West Port,<p>the perpetrator of this horrid deed had eluded the<p> search of the police; but as he is well known, it<p>is  hoped he will not long be able to conceal him-<p> self from justice....Edinburgh Observer of Tuesday<p>12thseptember.<p>--------------------------------------------------------------------<p>A full and Particular Account of the Trial<br>and Sentence of Wm. Alexander, and<br>Janet Blackwood, or Martin, who were-<br>tried before the High Court of Justici-<br>ary, on Monday 29th January 1827,<br>for Murder, and Assault, on the person,<br>of Catherine Smith, wife of the said<br>Wm. Alexander, on 6th September last,<br>who died in the Infirmary on the 8th.<br>September, in consequence.<p>YESTERDAY, at Edinburgh, the High Court<br>of Justiciary proceeded  to  the Trial  of<br>William Alexander, mason, and Janet Blackwood,<br>alias Martin, accused of Murder, as also Assault, in<br>violently, wickedly, and feloniously attacking, on<br>the 6th September last, Catherine Smith, or Alex-<br>ander, wife of the said W. Alexander, then residing<br>in Leith Wynd, repeatedly striking her with clench-<br>ed fists, and with a pair of tongs, &c. on the head,<br>face, chest, and limbs, until she was knocked to the<br>ground, and reduced to a state of insensibility, and<br>severely and mortally wounded, to the great effusion<br>of her blood, and one of her ribs broken ; and she<br>continued to languish in the Royal Infirmary till.<br>the 8th September, when she died, in consequence<br>of the injuries thus received, and was thereby mur-<br>dered.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; W. Alexander was accused of having pre-<br>viously evinced deadly malice and ill-will against<br>his late wife, by striking, maltreating, and harshly<br>using her, especially for 18 months preceding her<br>leath. There was also an alternate charge of assault<br>against both pannels.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They plead Not Guilty.<p>From the evidence it appeared that some children<br>observed the deceased through the window, sirting<br>on a stool before the fire, almost in a state of nudity.<br>The female prisoner was sitting at the fire supping<br>broth, and frequently struck the deceased on the<br>mouth with a spoon. Alexander was then sitting<br>at the back of the bed also supping broth. Ann<br>Balfour, a neighbour of Alexander's, was called to<br>look through the window between 5 and 6 in the<br>evening, when she saw the deceased sitting before<br>the fire, with nothing on but her shift, which was<br>marked with blood in the breast, her arms folded,<br>and hor head hanging back. Her husband came<br>from the bed, and struck her violently on the left<br>ear, which knocked her below the table, on the cross-<br>bar of which her head fell; she did not move.-<br>Alexander appeared looking for his cloths after strik-<br>ing his wife, (having nothing on but his shirt), and<br>as she lay, he placed either his foot or his knee on<br>her breast, not accidentally, but designedly and with<br>violence. The female prisoner was lying on the<br>bed Alexander came from when he struck the blow,<br>?John Balfour, aged, 12, and two little girls fully<br>corroborated Mrs Balfour's evidence?Mr W. Shep-<br>herd, a special constable, and Mr David Arthur,<br>junior, described the situation in which the deceased<br>was found : she was insensible, and the latter wit-<br>nes! got a woman to wash the blood from her face,<br>who also took a quantity of blood from her mouth.<br>Both said she appeared to be in liquor, as did Mr<br>Black, surgeon to the Police. Mr Black discovered<br>a sevre cotusion on the right side of the head, on<br>which he bled her, and in consequence of the dan-<br>gerous symtoms, next morning she was conveyed<br>to the Royal Infirmary, where she died on the se-<br>cond day. Dr Newbigging was then examined.<p>The Lord Advocate said he should give op the case against the<br>woman; and from the evidence of Dr Newbigging, he found he<p>could not bring home the charge of murder against the man, <p>therefore would only  ask for a verdict of culpable homicide.<p>The Lord Justice Clerk made a very few observations to the<br>jury, who, without hesitation, returned a verdict of culpable ho-<br>micide against Alexander, and as to Blackwood the libel not pro-<br>ven; the former was sentenced to be transported for fourteen<br>years, and tho latter was dismissed from the bar, with a severe<p>admonition . The Court was immensely crowded. <p>Printed for Wm. Henry.Price One Penny.</p>
