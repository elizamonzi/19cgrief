	<p> A New Way of Rais-<br>ing the Wind!<p>An account of rather a New and Curious<br>Circumstance that took place at Aber-<br>deen a few days ago, between a re-<br>spectable Lecturer on Anatomy in<br>that City, and a party of Sailors from<br>a Merchant Vessel, who touched there<br>on her voyage from America.?Ex-<br>traded from " the Fife Journal" of<br>Thursday the 26th February, 1829.<p>WE have many stories from various parts of'<br>the country, relative to the late atrocious<br>murders in the West Port, some of rather a dis-<br>graceful nature ; but the following, copied from a<br>respectable Newspaper, is of a different cast, and<br>may be viewed as the frolicsome thought of the<br>moment:<p>" A  BLACK SUBJECT.....A&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;few&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;days&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ago,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;an<br>English vessel on her voyage from America touch-<br>ed at Aberdeeen. Some of the crew belonging to<br>that place, along with the rest of their messmates,<br>went ashore in the evening, to spend an hour or <br>two over a cheerful glass of grog. They drank<br>rather freely, and Burk and his associates, having<br>been the topic of conversation for a part of the<br>night, it occurred to one of the tars, that to dis-<br>pose of a subject would be a speedy and sure me-<br>thod of raising the wind?in which they were a<br>little deficient for the sake of the reckoning. The<br>plan, after a little conversation on the practibility<br>of its execution, was unanimously agreed upon ;?<br>and a daring man of colour volunteered to be the<br>subject, provided they could furnish him with a<br>large knife. Being equipped with one of a proper<br>size, he was put into a sack which had been pro-<br>cured ; and three of the crew of the best address,<br>called at the house of a Lecturer on Anatomy and<br>disposed of the bony, telling him it was one of<br>their messmates who, previous to their arrival, had<br>died of apoplexy, Having got £3 in hand, with<br>the promise of more next day, they carried the<br>corpse down into the cellar, the lecturer and his<br>servant coming along with them and locking the<br>door.<p>" With as little delay as possible the black sub-<br>ject cut open the sack; and, with his knife in his<br>hand, anxiously waited the return of the lecturer.<br>He did not wait long, for, in a few minutes the<br>lector came back to look at his purchase, when<br>uddenly the dead man rushed upon him, which<br>so much alarmed him, that he forthwith ran up<br>the stairs, followed by the black subject, who, upon<br>gaining the street door, lost no time in joining his<br>messmates. A jovial bumper to the health of the<br>Doctor and his subject concluded the spree; and<br>the whole crew, " gloriously fu','' returned to their<br>vessel, which sailed next morning... Montrose Re-<br>view."&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (PRICE ONE PENNY.)</p>
