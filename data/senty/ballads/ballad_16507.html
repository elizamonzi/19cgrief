	<p> A POINTED AND POETIC<p>Appeal to the People!<p>Will the people submit to the horrid disgrace,<br>Than which I can't fancy a greater,<br>Of a Member whose nose is agee on his face,<br>(And his principles not one whit straighter ;)<br>And looks, by the powers, as it stands all agog,<br>As if it had quarrelled with half his phizog !<p>A straight forward Tory is not what I mean,<br>One whose deeds and whose pledges agree,<br>For that is a creature that never has been,<br>And never is likely to be !<br>But surely the Tories at least might have chose<br>A lad who could boast of a straightforward nose.<p>If to " follow his nose '' any one should advise,<br>'Twill be well that he never should heed him,<br>For if with such counsel he rashly complies,<br>What a deuc'd crooked course it will lead him !<br>So let them advise, Jack, but don't you obey,<br>Or nil you, or will you, you can't choose but stray.<p>And then see its bridge ! what a terrible height!<br>So towering ! fleshless ! and lean !<br>Just almost as high, altho' not perhaps quite,<br>As its counterpart over the Dean !<br>Why, the Cockneys, in utter amaze, will exclaim,<br>My eye! Is the nose of each Scotchman the same?<p>Why, my lads, 'tis both proper the man we select,<br>The cause of his country should plead ;<br>And one who may likewise some credit reflect<br>On the Scotch, as a swatch of the breed ;<br>'Or else they'll suppose, (G-d forbid it's the case),<br>That the Celts have become a degenerate race.<p>Old Topboots, whatever his principles be,<br>(And I can't say I greatly admire them ;)<br>Yet when he rose up in the House, six feet three,<br>With alarm he'd be sure to inspire them ;<br>Atoning, perhaps, by his stature immense,<br>For what was deficient in logic or sense.<p>But really, friend Coachy, I can't see the use,<br>Of your bothering folk with your prosin',<br>For the great Hoose of Commons, depend on't's a hoose,<br>To which you never will thrust your wry nose in:<br>So stick to the wheels of your coaches about ye,<br>And Government's wheels will go quite weel without ye.</p>
