	<p> EXECUTION<p>A Particular Account of the Execution, and last Dying<br>Declaration and Behaviour, of ROBERT SCOTT,<br>who was Executed, on&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;that part of the Road be- <br>tween Earlston and Greenlaw, where he commit-<br>ted the Bloody deeds, yesterday, Wednesday the<br>29th October, 1823, for the Horrid and Barbarous<p>Murder of Two men on the evening of the 30th<br> June last, and his Body sent to Edin for Dissotion<p><p>THIS unfortunate and infatuated victim of passion and crime,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  ROBERT SCOTT, it will be remembered, was tried before<br>the Circuit Court of Justiciary, at Jedburgh, on the  16th of Sep-<br>tember last, for the Barbarous Murder of James Aitcheson and Ro-<br>ber Simm, both of Greenlaw,  and otherwise horribly mutilating<br>their Bodies, in a shocking manner, on their return from Earlston<br>fair, where they had had some frivolous quarrel, on the evening of<br>the 30th of June last.  He was unanimously found Guilty, and<br>sentenced to be executed, as near the spot where he committed the<br>murders as should be found convenient, on  Wednesday the 29th<br>of October, and his body to be afterwards delivered to Dr Monro,<br>of Edinburgh, for Dissection.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; During the whole trial, Scott beha-<br>ved with, great self-possession, and continued perfectly calm and<br>composed, even after the fatal verdict was returned.<p>We have been informed, from a quarter on which every reliance<br>may be placed, that, since his condemnation, this unfortunate man<br>conducted himself with very great propriety,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  He had made full<br>and ample confession, and acknowledged the justice of his sentences<br>He had an extensive knowledge of the Scriptures, and attended, with<br>great apparent seriousness, to the admonitions and devotions of the<br> ministers of religion, all of whom, belonging to Jedburgh, had<br> shewn the most anxious attention to his spiritual welfare.<p>A very strong and ponderous Gallows was made in Edinburgh<br>which was sent out on two double carts, and erected on the very<br>spot where the murders were committed, a few days before the ex-<br>ecution. On the morning of Wednesday last, pursuant to.his sen-<br>tence, Scott was taken from the Cast1e of Jedburgh, and placed on a<br>cart, with his back to the horse's tail, and the executioner facing<br>him. The Sheriff of Roxburghshire, attended by his officers, and<br>a strong party of the Yeomanry Cavalay of the county, escortedt he<br>melancholy procession to the limits of the shire, where the unhap-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>py man was delivered over to the Sheriff of Berwickshire, who was<br>similarly attended, and who conducted himself to the fatal tree<br>which was not a stone above cast from his own house.<p>  Soon after appearing on the Scaffold,  a pslam was sung, in which<br>Scott willingly  joined, and then a most appropriate prayer was put<br>up on his behalf, by one of the Clergy men who had so kindly attend-<br>ed him. He afterwards stepped forward to the railing, and, in a most<br>earnest and impressive manner, addressed the numerous multitude<br>of spectators assembled round, the scaffold, in a short speech  in<br>which, among other things, he solemnly besought them not to al-<br>low their passions, at any time, to get the better of their reason,<br>nor, to indulge themselves, on any account whatever, in drinking<br>ardent spirits to excess, which always inflamed the passions, and<br>rendered them uncontroulable ; a sad example of the effects of vio-<br>lent and ungovernable passion, he said was now before them, in the<br>melancholy case of him who now, for the last time, addressed them.<br>He concluded, by hoping that none who now heard him would e-<br>ver be so cruel as cast up to any of his innocent children his crimes<br>or his shameful end.  He then shook hands with some around&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>him, and bowed to others, when  immediately mounted the fatal <br>drop; and, while the executioner was adjusting, the rope round the<br>beam, he was most earnest in private prayer,with his hands clasp-<br>ed.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In a few. minutes he dropped the signal, and was instantly<br> launched into eternity a little after 3 o'clock&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After hanging about<br> thirty-five minutes, the body was cut down, placed in the cart,<br>covered with a sheet, and sent into Edinburgh, for Dissection.<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Robert Scott was a tall athletic strong man, apparently about 44<br> or 45 years of age  and left a wife and five children to deplore his<p> loss.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -------------&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  .<p>  Edinburgh....Printed for William Johnston..........Price One Penny.</p>
