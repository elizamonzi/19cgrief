	<p> RIOT<p>at Musselburgh<p>A full and particular account of a<br>most serious and distressing RIOT,<br>which took place on Musselburgh<br>Links yesterday, Thursday, 31st of<br>July, 1823, between the Irish,<br>& Colliers, and Salters, with a full<br>account of how it originated, and<br>the number of the Killed and<br>Wounded.<p>A most disgraceful scene took place on&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Musselburgh Race-<br>ground, immediately after the second heat was run, owing as<br>some says to a Irishman upon  ths coarse threshing a baker<br>with a large stick, when the baker knocked, him dawn in re-<br>turn, and a number of Irishman fell upon the baker and used<br>him most shamefully, the by-standers took part and a general<br>ensued ; others says some people got  their pockets picked<br>while looking on at some fellows  who  was  gambling with<br>the thimbles and the garter, and those playing finding them-<br>selves always the losers,  among  which  were&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a number of<br>colliers, salters, &c. who are in general very opstrepulous, fel-<br>lows, wheu they think themselves wronged a quarrel ensued<br>betwixt the losers and the gainer, when  it came to blows, in<br>which the mob took part, and the almost efforts the peace-<br>officers could make, had not  the least effect, part of the pail-<br>ing enclosing  the  course  was&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;torn  down,  and stands  and<br>tables broken to pieces.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The  gambler  with whom the riot<br> originated with, happening to  be an Irishnan, the mob fell<br>to and  threshed every  one of the same country they could<br>meet with, stones were  thrown  in various  directions by a<br>number of mischievious boys which rendered it very unsafe<br>to those people who were at a distance and did not interfere<br>with the crowd, one poor old mao while in  the act of cating<br>some mussles at the  outside of a tent, received a severe COH-<br>cussion in the head a little  above the temple; a girl got a<br>serious blow in the back with a half-brick and was carried<br>away insensible.  A number of men received severe blows<br>and the blood was&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;flowing  copiously  from&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;them.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One<br>Irishman took shelter into a tent kept by one of his country-<br>men, when the&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;mob  disgracefully tore down, the erection,<br>and broke and spoilt whatever came is their way. A woman<br>was carried away dangerously hurt.  The mob in the most<br>wauton manner attacked the shows, and shamefully tore the<br>erections asunder, and knocked down and beat those who<br>appeared in the least to be opposite to their unlawful pro-<br>cedings ; they did a great deal of damage to them.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is re-<br>ported that there are one dead and other  two no hopes are<br>entertained of their recovery.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  We are happy to  say that<br>the peace-officers succeeded in apprehending some of the<br>most active among the rioters.</p>
