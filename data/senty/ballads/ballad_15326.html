	<p> TO THE PUBLIC.<p>MODE OF EXTINGUISHING FIRE.<p>THE awful scenes we have just witnessed, will, I trust, be sufficient to call the<br>public attention to the subject of this paper ; and  that liberality which in the present day<br>is so encouraging to the progress of Science, will, I hope, secure it a candid examina-<br>tion.  When witnessing the late dreadful Fire in the High Street, an idea suddenly<br>occurred to me, embracing, as I thought, so much in its object, by conducing to the<br>welfare of my Fellow-Creatures, that I conceived it a duty incumbent upon me to make<br>it known. The accumulation of intelligence occasioned by the recent occurrences, has<br>so much occupied the Journals, as to close that source of communication.  Without<br>further preface, therefore, I shall proceed in the relation of the plan I have in view.<br>To those at all conversant in Chemistry, the power of the Ærial Fluid, known by the name<br>of Carbonic Acid Gas, in extinguishing Fire, is perfectly familiar.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Gas exists so<br>abundantly in nature, that it would seem to have been formed for some most important<br>purpose ; and in common chalk is so predominant, that by a trifling degree of heat, it<br>may be expelled in great quantities. Without enumerating the various modes in which it<br>may be procured, I shall merely propose, that a Company be formed, and Gas-holders<br>erected, the Gas to be thus distributed, like that of Coal Gas, through Towns.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The apart-<br>ments of every dwelling-house shall be provided with pipes, to be p aced at the highest part<br>of the room, and only to be connected with the main pipes when their use is required.<br>The connexion may be formed in a similar manner to that which is at present used<br>when water is required, by the opening of the plug. By such an arrangement, any Fire<br>in a dwelling-house may be extinguished in a few minutes. As this Gas may be dreaded<br>from its deleterious effects in the inhalation, all danger is thus removed.  The specific<br>gravity of this Gas being greater than Atmospherical Air, it will consequently require the<br>pressure of the Gas-holder to expel it from the pipes.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All communication between the<br>Gas-holder and the pipes may be intercepted by a stop-cock, only to be opened in case of<br>necessity.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Other means may be used of forcing the Gas, such as Pumps, &c. of which I<br>shall speak more in detail, if my plan should be recognised. After the Gas has been used,<br>if necessary, the common Fire-Engines might convey lime water for its removal ; or if<br>pumps be used for raising it, they can be easily made to return it.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are persons<br>who may object to the expense of this undertaking ; but when we take into consideration<br>the anxiety and alarm which this proposal seems calculated to remove, humanity would<br>suggest its trial. The Carbonic Acid Gas generated in Breweries might be collected<br>for this purpose.<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  FREDERICK W. MORRIS,<br>EDINBURGH, 19th Nov. 1824.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; STUDENT OF  MEDICINE.</p>
