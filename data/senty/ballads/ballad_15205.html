Both are of  slen-<br>der but athletic make,?Thomson about 5 ft.<br>10 in. high<p>The declarations emitted by the prisoners<br>were of great length, and chiefly consisted of<br>rambling, inconsistent, and unimportant state-<br>ments.<p>Colin Pentland  and his wife were called to<br>prove the accidental meeting of the deceased<br>and the prisoners at their house an the night<br>of the 17th of April, and their subsequent de-<br>parture together, with the carts, for Gilmerton.<p>Walter Dingwall, residing at Gilmerton, was<br>called to prove that Thomson's horse had<br>brought his cart into the village of Gilmerton.<br>without his master. This witness, and the <br>wife of one Bamberry, a stater in Gilmerton,<br>and others, found the shawl of the deceased,<br>her bundle of meat, &c., in Thomson's cart.<p>Alexander Denham and a young man named<br>Wright, and others, in consequence of Thom,<br>son being missing, set off on the road to Edin-<br>burgh in search of him. On their return  they<br>were attrac ed by the groans of the deceased<br>to the spot where she was lying, near the<br>third mile stone; and finding her to be in a<br>very depl rable state, they carried her to the<br>house of Ban berry, into which she was hu-<br>manely received. In the mean time, a person<br>had met Thomson coming into  the village, and<br>had said to him, from the circumstance of the<br>hawl being found in his cart, You have had<br>a woman with you to-night.' To which he<br>replied,  Yes, she's joint behint me.'<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Drs Benton and Morrison of Dalkeith,<br>physicians, proved the frightful nature of<br>the injuries inflicted on the deceased,?her<br>extreme sufferings,? her death in consequence<br>of  those injuries,? the appearances of the truly<br>berrid and shocking lacerations and wounds,<br>and the consequent mortification after death,<br>?and also the finding of the stones, &c. with<p>in the body of the ill fated woman__The same<p>Gentlemen, also, and other witnesses, proved<br>that the deceased had declared, while in the<br>prospect of death, that both the prisoners had<br>committed the crimes to which she fell a victim<p>Several witnesses from Greenend and other<br>places proved that the prisoners had made<br>their treatment of  the deceased a subject of<br>ribald jest and boasting to their companions.<p>The tin box, belonging to the deceased was<br>traced to the possession of Dobie; and her<br>handkerchif was taken from Thomson's<br>pocket, when \ill\ was apprehended.<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;========<p>Second Edition, Further Partriculars<p>The jury retired between&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;one and two o'-<br>clock in the morning ; and after an absence of<br>about ten minutes, returned and pronunced<br>by their Chancellor the following verdict :-<br>My Lords the jury&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;unanimously&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;find both<br>the pannels Guilty of the Robbery,  the Mur-<br>der, and the assault with intent to Ravish  and<br>find the charge of  Rape Not Proven.<p>After the two learned Judges seated on the<br>Bench with the Lord justice Clerk, had sever-<br>ally expressed&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;their full&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;concurrence in the<br>verdict of  the Jury, and their unqualified Lcr-<br>ror of the dreadful and unparalleled  atrocity<br>of the guilt of the prisoners ?whose brutality<br>had been such, that the unfortunate  woman<br>would have been comparatively Safe, had she<br>been left  to wander amongst the rudest and<br>most barbarous savages of  the most barbarous<br>portion  of  the earth,?<p>The Lord Justice Clerk in an awfully so-<br>lemn address to the prisoners, told them that<br>if ever there was a case in which there was<br>no hope of Mercy, that case was theirs, and<br>in which he exhorted them to prepare for<br>eternity, sentenced them to be hanged in the<br>Lawnmarket, on Wednesday the 18th of <br>August, between tight and ten o clock in the<br>morning; and thereafter their bodies to be<br>given to Dr Monro, to be  by him publicly<br>d ssected and anatomised.<p>Thomson evidently quailed under the obser<br>vations of the Judges.<p> Dobie addressed the Lord Justice Clerk in<br>these  words, "My Lord  I have one thing to<br>say if you please.?
