	<p> Trial and Sentence.<p>A Full, True and Particular Account of the Trial<br>and Sentence of Thomas Beveridge, who is to be<br>executed on the 2d of December next, for the<br>Murder of his Wife, on the 2d of October, 1831,<br>and his body given for dissection.<p>Yesterday, Monday the 14th November, 1831, came on the trial of<br>Thomas Beveridge, indicted for murder, in so far as on the 2d of<br>October, the said Thomas Beveridge did, within or near the<br>house situated in Little Jack's Close, Canongate, attack and assault<br>the deceased Janet Greig or Beveridge, his wife, with a poker, a fire<br>shovel, and a knife, or with one or more of the said instruments,<br>strike and cut her repeatedly on the head, face, hands, arms, legs<br>and thighs, and did inflict upon her numerous severe wounds, in<br>consequence of which she died in the course of the same day in the<br>Royal Infirmary, to which she had been conveyed, and there died.<br>The pannel pleaded not guilty.<p>John Hamilton, blacksmith, was in the pannel's house on the mor-<br>ning Mrs Beveridge died, she and the pannel were quarreling; she<br>was then in good health; he complained of her being addicted to<br>drink, and said he had given up striking her, for it was of no use.<p>John Grant, wright, lived next door to the pannel, and frequently<br>heard quarreling between him and his wife, and cries of murder, on<br>Sunday night the 2d October, between four and six, heard faint cries<br>of " oh, oh," and then a faint scream, but paid no particular attention<br>because he often heard such sounds. Also heard a noise as of a<br>chair rumbling and something trailing on the floor. Supposed that<br>the scream was that of Mrs Beveridge, but the noise was much<br>fainter than her usual cries. She was wont to bawl out lustily.<br>Did not hear Beveridge's voice. About six o'clock witness's son said<br>there is Beveridge away out, this was after the cries were heard. Be-<br>tween sik and seven the pannel's daughter and another girl came and<br>knocked at the door, and having got in, a Mrs Edwards sent one<br>of the girls for witness, who, on going into Beveridge's house found<br>Mrs Beverage sitting on a chair. Could scarcely look at her ; her<br>mouth and face was covered with blood, and her nose shoved up.<br>She was quite insensible : and a drop of water put into her mouth<br>gurgled in her throat. Her clothes were as if water had been<br>thrown on her, and the floor was wet. There was a sort of hallow<br>inside the door, where a large quantity of blood and water had lodged,<br>the furniture of the house was all in confusion. Beveridge and his<br>wife did not agree well, this he ascribed to her being much addicted<br>to drinking,<p>Mrs Suttle, a near neighbour, then gave evidence, as did Peter Grant,<br>printer, relative to hearing quarrelling and heary moaning from the<br>house of Beveridge : when James Gray, a blacksmith, whose evidence<br>was taken down, as being grossly false, prevaricating, and attempting<br>to conceal the truth. Gray was summarily proceeded against, and<br>sentenced to imprisonment for three kalendar months. John Garret,<br>was with Gray at the door knocking, but received no answer; was<br>in Coverly's about seven, when Beveridge came in, when he said,<br>" there's the very man, why did you deny yourself and not let us in ?'<br>Beveridge replied, " upon my soul, Jamie, I was up stairs in the door<br>above, had you come there you would have got me."<p>Several other witnesses were afterwards examined, who described<br>the state in which Mrs Beveridge was found on the floor : on being<br>asked by Catherine Biggar, who had done that to her, she said<br>faintly, ' You need not ask that.' A long medical report was read<br>by Dr Liston, from which it appeared that the deceased bore the<br>marks of a great number of contusions, in consequence of which<br>she died. The prisoner's declarations were then read ; after which<br>the Solicitor General addressed the Jury, and was followed by Mr<br>Skene for the prisoner.<p>The Lord Justice Clerk charged the Jury, and went over  the evi-<br>dence with his usual minuteness. The Jury, without leaving the<br>box, unanimously found the prisoner guilty, After several severe<br>remarks on the enormity of the crime by Lords Meadowbank,<br>Moncrieff, and Medwyn, the Lord Justice Clerk addressed the pri-<br>soner at considerable length, and concluded by saying, " that the<br>prisoner would now see the miserable effect of his attempts to con-<br>ceal the truth, and that all these attempts were futile. His lordship<br>then pronounced the fatal sentence that the prisoner be executed on<br>the 2d December, and his body given to Dr Munro for dissection."<p>Edinburgh .-?Printed for George Craig.?.Price One Penny</p>
