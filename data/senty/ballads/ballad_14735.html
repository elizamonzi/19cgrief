	<h2>Transcription</h2>
	<p> Account of the interesting Trial of John Stewart and Cathe-<br>rine Wright, for the Murder and Robbery of Robert Lamont,<br>on board the Toward Castle Steam Boat, on her passage from<br>Inverary to Glasgow, by giving him landanum in his drink,<br>whereby he became  insensible, and after Rabbing him of a large<br>sum of money, he shortly afterwards died. The trial took<br>place at Edinburgh on the 14th July, 1829; they are to be<br>Executed at Glasgow on Wednesday the 19th August next<p>EDINBURGH, 14th July, 1829.?This day, came on the trial of John Stewart<br>and  Catherine Wright, accused of murder and robbery on board the  above vessel.<p>The indictment charged the prisoners, while they were on board the said<br>vessel, plying on the Clyde, then on her voyage from Inveraray to Glasgow, and<br>when said Steam boat was on her way between Tarbert and Glasgow, with wilfully,<br>wickedly, and feloniously, administering to Robert Lamont, then a passenger in said<br>boat, and lately merchant and farmer, residing at Balligartan, in the parish of<br>Kilninian, in the island of Ulva, and shire of Argyle, a quantity of laudanum, or<br>some other narcotic or poisonous substance, which they had mixed up with a quan-<br>tity of porter or ale, or some other liquid, and which mixture they, or one or other<br>of them gave him, and in consequence of having taken the same, he fell into a pro-<br>found sleep, and while in that state, one, or both of them, robbed him of a pocket<br>book, containing nearly twenty pounds, and a purse with some money. That the,<br>said Robert Lamont, in consequence of his having drank the said laudanum, or<br> other narcotic substance on the 15th of December last, died in great agony on the<br>16th of the same month. The prisoners pled Not Guilty.<p>After a long and interesting trial, in which a number of witnesses were examined,<br>(whose evidence is too long for insertion here), the Jury was addressed with great<br>ability by the Counsel on both sides, after which the Lord Justice Clerk summed<br>up the evidence in a clear and impartial manner, when the Jury were inclosed and<br>ordered to return their verdict, which they afterwards did, finding both the pannels<br>Guilty of the crime libelled. .<p>The Lord Justice Clerk, previous to passing sentence impressed upon them the<br>heinous nature of the crime of taking away the life of a fellow creature, and warn-<br>ed them to improve the short time allotted them here, in making up their peace with<br>an offended God, whose laws they had broken.<p>His Lordship then passed sentence of death upon them, ordaining them to be<br>Executed at Glasgow, on Wednesday the 19th Aug. next, and their bodies to be<br>given to the Professor of Anatomy there for dissection.<p>The above is another horrid affair, and though not equal in extent to the mur-<br>ders which Burke committed, yet it is equal in enormity. Burke murdered that he<br>might get money far their bodies ; the pannels murdered that they might get money<br>from their victim's pockets. To invite a man, under the masque of friendship, to<br>drink with them, and pass a social hour together, and, in the midst of this feigned<br>friendship, to mix the deadly draught in the vessel out of which he drank, and at<br>the same time avoid it themselves, in order that they might get possession of his<br>property, is just another addition to those barbarous acts which lately occurred<br>at Edinburgh. It is said that they were before this in company with two persons<br>in Glasgow, who died shortly after drinking with them.<p>W. Carse, Printer, Glasgow.</p>
