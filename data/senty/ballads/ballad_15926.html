	<h2>Transcription</h2>
	<p> A True  and Correct Account of that<p>MOST WONDERFUL<p>CHILD,<p>Only 11 months old, which weighs be-<br>tween 9 and 1O stone, with a descrip-<br>tion of his length, thickness, and ap-<br>pearance, what diet he takes, &c. he<br>was born at Cambnsnethan, 15 miles<br>from Glasgow.<p>THE following is an account of one of the most wonderful<br> children, which it has ever fallen to the lot of man to pen,<br>and which would scarcely be believed unless it were fully auth-<br>enticated by the numerous persons who have had an opportuni-<br>ty of vouching to its truth, and who declare it to be one of the<br>greatest curiosities that ever appeared in the human world.<p>The child belongs to a respectable family in Cambusnethan,<br>was born in April 1820, and is at present only eleven months<br>old, and quite healthy; measures about a yard round the body,<br>and is well proportioned in every part ; the weight of this boy<br>is between nine and ten stones, his body, legs and arms being<br>exceeding thick, and the only difficulty attending the mother in<br>nursing him, is his wonderful weight ; she is obliged to have re-<br>course to the expedient of laying him upon a table or some other<br>support, not being able to carry him in her arms. Should he<br>be spared to arrive at the years of manhood, he will form one of<br>the most rare and wonderful personages which ever made their<br>appearance in this or any other country. His thickness is the<br>principal object which strikes the attention of the beholder, his<br>height not being greatly above that of other children at the same<br>age.<p>The diet of this child is similar to that which is given to other<br>children of the same age, consisting of bread-berry made up in<br>the usual manner, and of which he takes but a very moderate<br>quantity.<p>Great numbers of persons have been anxious to visit this in-<br>sant, wishing to attest the truth of it by their own observation.<br>not believing the stories which were propagated about it, but<br>which they now assert to be one of the greatest wonders ever<br>witnessed amongst the human race.<p>From this description. the reader may form an idea of this<br>child, and which he may rest assured is correct; the people who<br>saw it and communicated the particulars are of the most respect-<br>able order, and whose information may be confidently relied on.<p>When we reflect on this wonderful child, it shows us how varied<br>are the works of Him who called us into existenca, and who sup-<br>ports all things, and makes every thing tend to the intellectual<br>improvement of his creatures. When we reflect on the variety<br>of trees in the forrest, all varying in length and thickness, some<br>pleasant to the view of the beholder, and others tottering under<br>the infirmities of age, and when we view men in all their different<br>stages, each one differing from another in appearance : some stout<br>and healthy, others lingering and emaciated from disease ; some<br>possessed of all the learning and amiable qualities which adorn hu-<br>man life, and others possessed of a quite different disposition ; when<br>we consider all these differences of appearance in this lower world,<br>we are led to exclaim, ' How wonderful are thy works, O Lord,<br>yet in wisdom hast thou made them all. To him therefore, let<br>every created, bring how, and acknowledge him a the dispenser<br>of every lot in human life.<p>Price One Penny</p>
