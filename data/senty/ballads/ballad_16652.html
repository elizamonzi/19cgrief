The Bonnie Wee Window."<p>There is auld Bailie Snap he does reign in the east,<br>Wi' a braw gowden chain hanging over his breest;<br>Every coort mornin' he looks owre his crap,<br>And laughs at the drunk yins does auld Bailie Snap.<p>CHORUS.<br>Oh, for he's the reviewer of every ill doer,<br>Ye needna tell him ye've been takin' a drap ;<br>For like an auld miller he grasps at the siller,<br>There's few can get favour frae auld Bailie Snap.<p>The ither coort mornin' when daun'ering alang,<br>Richt into the coort-house I happened tae gang,<br>Whaur mony a chappie dejectedly sat,<br>And waited for justice frae auld Bailie Snap.<p>Oh, for he's the reviewer, &c.<p>Then the Bailie cam' in wi' a grand polished air,<br>And sat himsel' doon on a braw cushioned chair ;<br>Adjusting eye-glass he gied a bit rap -<br>" Bring forth the first case, noo," said auld Bailie Snap.<br>Oh, for he's the reviewer, &c.<p>The first was a woman, baith tatter'd an' frail,<br>Wha telt to the coort a most pitiful tale.<br>Said the judge, "You were drunk, so you'll just be as we<br>To rest you five days in 'The Temperance Hotel.' ''<p>Oh, for he's the reviewer, &c.<p>The next was a labourer ca'd Patrick Muldoon,<br>Was charged wi' disturbing the hauf o' the toon.<br>Says the judge, " It's five guineas, or else, my fine man,<br>You can whistle ' The Blackbird' in the Royal Van."<p>Oh, for he's the reviewer, &c.<p>Twa callans for mischief were charged baith the same,<br>Though evidence showed that yin wasna tae blame;<br>" If ye didna ocht, ye were there wi' the pack,<br>So your fined in five shillings," said auld Bailie Snap.<p>Oh, for he's the reviewer, &c.<p>The last was a weaver wi' lantern jaw,<br>Pled guilty to trying to haud up a wa';<br>He hadna got funds, so the judge did declare,<br>He could gang up to Duke Street an' prap the wa's there.<p>Oh, for he's the reviewer, &c.<p>Sae lang may the Bailie still reign on the Bench,<br>A terror to every man, woman, and wench ;<br>But when he is gaun for to tak' his last nap,<br>May they find a warm corner for auld Bailie Snap.<p>Oh, for he's the reviewer, &c.<p>MY BONNIE DARK-EYED DEARIE.<p>Words by John Pettigrew.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Music by T. S. Gleadhill,<p>Glasgow.<br>Oh, the sun has set an' gloamin' grey<p>Hangs owre the earth sae dreary,<br>The paitricks cry while on my way<p>To meet my dark-eyed dearie.<br>The angry wind amang the trees<p>Keeps sooching, sad, and eerie,<p>But what care I though cauld's the breeze<p>When gaun to see my dearie.<p>CHOrUS.<br>Oh, for Maggie's artless, young, and fair,<p>Sae mensfu', kind, and cheery ;<br>Through life 'twill be my only care <p>To lo'e my dark-eyed dearie.<br>Young Maggie wears nae pridefu' air,<p>Nor heart that's fause an' hollow;<br>Her modest ways and virtues rare,<p>A' ither maids micht follow.<br>Wi' such a lassie for a wife<br>  Nae man could ever weary,<br>She'll cheer me through the vale o' life,<p>My bonnie dark-eyed dearie.<p>Oh, for Maggie's artless, &c.<p>ANCIENT&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; STIRLING.<p>Written by John Pettigrew.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sung, with Immense Success,<br>by Hamilton Corbett.<p>AIR. - " The Standard on the Braes o' Mar."<p>Let minstrels sing of sparkling wine,<p>In verses high and skirling ;<br>Let lovers praise their maidens fine,<p>I'll sing of ancient Stirling.<br>Whaur Wallace bold, in days of old,<p>His faithful band he did command,<p>And Southern foemen couldna stand<p>The Scottish steel at Stirling.<p>King Edward did oor thistle spurn,<p>An' cam' to Scotland whirling,<br>But when he cam' to Bannockburn<p>It jagg'd his thooms near Stirling.<br>For valiant Bruce, sae slee an' crouse,<br>The English armies did reduce,<br>And Scotland's independence gained<p>That day near ancient Stirling.<p>When queenly simmer comes to reign,<p>An' sends king winter birling,<br>She seems to mak' the place her ain,<p>Sic braws she gies to Stirling.<br>When fragrant flowers au' scented thorn,<br>The bonnie vales an' glens adorn,<p>Hoo sweet upon a simmer's thorn,<p>To walk roon' classic Stirling.<br>But noo a secret I will tell,<p>Nor roon' the bush gang whirling,<p>One modest flower that I lo'e well, <br>Blooms sweet in ancient Stirling.<p>Her form sae fair, her smile sae rare,<br>Her daisy face sae fu' o' grace,<p>Her winning ways my heart ensnare,<br>And mak' me cling to Stirling.<p>LEAVING THEE FOR EVER.<p>Words by John Pettigrew.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Music by Albert E. Hampson,<br>Edgely Villa, Southport, England.<p>I leave thee, dear, with scorn,<p>Nor treat thee, dear, with scorn,<br>But could I dream so fair a flower<p>Would ever nurse a thorn ?<br>I loved thee with that ardent flame,<p>Unqueuched by lake or river;<p>I love thee, maiden, still the same,<p>Though leaving thee for ever.<p>Leaving thee, yes, leaving thee,<br>Leaving thee for ever.<p>When shrubs and flowerets were in bloom<p>We lovingly would rove,<br>Where hawthorn lent its sweet perfume<p>A-down the scented grove;<br>Or when some sylvan nook we sought<p>By Clutha's winding river,<br>Could I then entertain the thought<p>Of leaving thee for ever.<p>Leaving thee, &c.<p>Ah, no! my heart was still with thee,<p>Thou cheeredst each cloudy hour ;<br>By night or day thou wert to me<p>Like dewdrops to the flower.<br>But false deceit and rival's pride<p>Command that we should sever;<br>May powers above thy footsteps guide,<p>False maid, adieu, for ever.<p>Leaving thee, &c.<p>NOTICE TO THE PUBLIC. - I am the only one of this name who has written for the Scotch or English Press, either in prose or<br>rhyme. A Sketch of my Life may be seen at the Mitchell Library, Ingram Street, Glasgow - See " Our Modern Scottish Poets," vol. v.<br>page .35. A poem in my own hand-writing may be seen in the National Burns' Monument, Kilmarnock. I have been acknowledged by<br>the Scotch, English, and Irish Press, and I have been the winner of some Handsome Prizes. I was also instrumental in bringing out<br>some of our Comic Singers with such songs as "The Lads that were reared amang the Heather," "Sandy Sourkail's Wedding,"<br>"Jeemie, Rin Doon to your Uncle's," "Peggy is the Lass can wear the Breeks," and fifty other favourite songs; but in the hour of<br>adversity the Vocalists have turned the cold shoulder to me, therefore I ask the general public to kindly patronize your humble Servant,<p>JOHN PETTIGREW.<p>PRINTED FOR THE AUTHOR ONLY AT THE MINERVA PRINTING WORKS, 80 LONDON STREET, GLASGOW</p>
