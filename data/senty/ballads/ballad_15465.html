	<h2>Transcription</h2>
	<p> Downfal of Soci-<br>alism! Death of<br>Robert Owen !<p>This is a curious Article on Socialism, extracted<br>from the Glasgow Weekly Dispatch, and the reader<br>cannot but be amused at the death of the Founder<br>of that System which is so fast falling to the<br>ground, that in one night the foundation gave way,<br>leaving the superstructure tottering in the air.<p>This far-famed polutionist  of the  female sex, de-<br>grader of the noble destinies of man, and contemner<br>of the laws of God?this insignificant personage<br>who vainly thought to set up the weak imagination<br>of his own perverted mind above the sublime pro-<br>vidence of an all-powerful Governor?this poor<br>wretch, who set himself up as the god of the hi-<br>deous monster known by the unappropriate title of<br>" Socialism"?this hoary headed sinner, we are<br>sorry?no we are happy to learn, by a letter from<br>Lincoln, died very suddenly in " the gall of bitter-<br>ness and the bond of iniquity" on Tuesday last.<br>It appears that Robert had been discussing his fa-<br>vourite subject with a very powerful and able an-<br>tagonist, on Monday, who handled the subject so<br>well that poor Owen left the hall in a galloping con-<br>sumption. After reaching his lodgings he felt the<br>disease rapidly gaining ground, and accordingly<br>sent for the parish physician, who prescribed the<br>following dose:?-Two grains of Humility, one<br>grain of Prayer, one drop of the influence of the<br>Spirit, mixed up with one grain of Faith, accom-<br>panied with copious draughts from the Fountain<br>of Life, This Owen considered a strong dose, but<br>nevertheless, being determined to be relieved from<br>the deadly grasp of his Social tormentor, he took<br>the dose, which soon did its work?its powerful<br>effects were soon seen in pulling down the strong-<br>holds of Satan and levelling Socialism in the dust.<br>After undergoing the most excruciating pain, as he<br>vomited up his hypocricy to his father-in-law,<br>when he imposed on him by his sanctimoniousness,<br>in order to secure the fortune of Mrs Owen, as he<br>vomited up his plans of Social wickedness, with his<br>abominable publications, and at last Robert Owen<br>the Socialist expired with the New Moral World in<br>his throat, and there arose Robert Owen the humble<br>Christian. The New Man rose and commenced<br>burning every book connected with the beastly<br>system of which he was the founder the New<br>Moral World he committed to the flames, rejoicing<br>and praising God that the day of retribrution had<br>arrived, that Owen the Socialist was no more, his<br>plans for overturning the Providence of God con-<br>sumed in the flames, and Socialism burned to ashes,<br>never to raise its guilty head.<p>We fondly hope our information is correct, and<br>that the Hall of Science blackguards will' follow  <br>the noble example of their leader, and become dead<br>unto the beastly system.<p>Reprinted for J, M'Culloch.</p>
