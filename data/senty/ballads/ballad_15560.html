	<p> An Account of the Life and Dying Confession of William Anderson<br>Horner, Son to Peter Anderson Horner, Living in the Parish of<br>Saline in the Shire of Pearth, who Murdered Elison Mitchill,<br>Wife of David Blyth Horner also,in the beginning of Winter,1708.<br>in manner following.<p>HE has declared and confessed, That the said David Blyth, being gone a Soldier abroad for<br>some Years, the said Elison his Wife, came very frequently to his Father Peter Ander-<br>son's House, who lent his Horse often to her to thig Corn with, and other things in their<br>Season : But that her frequent coming gave such Offence to William's Mother, and he using<br>her Company, that the Mother warn'd him to forbear her Company, and told him, that the<br>did foresee his Ruine by it: But whether he the said William would or not, the said Elison<br>would keep his Company,and follow him whithersoever he would go; and did continue so to<br>do, for two Years before he had any carnal Dealing with her; but was so bewi tched with<br>heratlast, that they lived together as Man and Wife, for almost a Year before the said Mur-.<br>der was committed, in Adultery, her Husband being alive, and now come home. That on<br>Saturday the Murder was committed, hehadsenta dozon of Spoons to the Market, and 14<br>pence was got for them ; that in the Evening, he met with his Mother, and the said Elison<br>coming home, who went all three with another Man into an Ale-House at Laggs, where<br>they Drank, and disagreeing, the Women went away, and that he in a short timefollow'd ;<br>that the Mother went home, but he met with Elison sitting on the Road through the Ley-<br>Ground homeward ; and that it being dark, he ask'd who it was, whereupon she told him,<br>he should soon knew, and immediately took hold of him by the Hair and Crava te, thinking to<br>have Strangled him, as he thought ; whereupon he being in Drink, drew out the same Knif<br>which was produced before the Lords of Justiciary, and gave her a Stob in the Neck, and<br>which not having had its defign'd Effect, he returned the 2d and 3d, which last, went to,<br>or near the Heart, at which she fell to the Ground, as it were Groaning to death ; whereup-<br>on he left her, and went home, and told his Father and Mother what he had done ; who told<br>him, that he would sadly repent it: That his Parents chiding of him, made him return to<br>her again (being but about a short half Mile from home) and finding her struggling to get<br>to the next House,he helped her thither,and recommended her to their Care : And hearingon<br>Sunday that she was dead, he endeavoured to make his Escape, but was pursued and seized by<br>Alexander Taylor Good-man of the Mill ofBallarh, and Alexander White a neighbour Farmer,<br>and committed him to the Prison of Creiff, where he lay till he was brought to this City Pri-<br>son in February last ; in which place he lay till Munday the 26th of December last, when the<br>Lords of Justiciary, after clear and full Probation of the Murder aforesaid being led against<br>him, their Lordships Sentenc'd him to be hang'd on this day to death, and afterwards to be<br>hung up in Chains between Edinburgh and Leith, to terrify others from the like Crime.<p>Ever since the pronouncing of the said Sentence, the learned and pious Divines of the City,<br>and others, (but most frequently the ordinary Minister of the Tolbooth) did Visit, Examine,<br>and Exhort him to Confess, and acknowledge the hainousness of his Crime: But notwith-<br>standing of the same, and the many Learn'dand most edifying Lectures and Sermons he heard<br>by the Ordinary, and others in the Prison, (and more especially of extraordinary Discourses<br>preach'd by the Ordinary on the first Instant, on these Words Rev. cha. ver. -Blessed are<br>the dead that dye in Lord, Pointing out the Terrors of Death to all Men, especially to the<br>Wicked, and the accruing Comforts to the Godly) yet he continued very obsur'd, and hard<br>Hearted, until Munday last, that the Chains ordered to hing him up in, were try'd upon him,<br>to see how they fitted him, then his Heart softned, and confessed his Crime, and the hai-<br>noufnels thereof to the Ordinary, who took great Pains upon him ; and since is become more<br>pliable and attentive to Exhortation, Reading, Prayer and Praises: But often (upon the Que-<br>stion) said that he could not Pray. He was brought down to the Hall last Night, where se-<br>veral of the Debt Prisoners and Keeprs sat with him, some of them constantly going about<br>some Exercise and Duties, at which he seemed to be extreamly satisfied, and sigh'd often,<br>Praying God to Pardon his Sins for Christ's sake.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'<p>About 8 this Morning, the Minister of Saline, in whose Parish his Parents live, came to<br>him, to whom he confessed Breaches of the Lord's Day, Drunkeness Leudness, Disobedi-<br>ence to his Parents, especially in relation to the said Elison Mitchill, Lieing, Theiving, &c.<br>particularly 3 Shillings Sterling he stold from a Neigbbour Prisoner since he came to their Pri-<br>son, but was discover'd, and taken from him again; He desired the aforesaid Minister,<br>that he would Pray God to forgivehim his Sins for Christ's sake, yea and the Minister<br>prepar'dhim tounderstand some of the Chief Principles of the Christian Religion, concern-<br>ing Faith and Repentance, &c. so that there are good Signs of his serious Repentance;<br>Considering his unhappy Education and Ignorance in the Knowledge of God : And when he<br>went to the Scaffold, he acknowledged the Murder, Breach of the Lord's Day, Cursing and<br>Swearing, and Disobeying his Parents &c. And desired, thatall the Spectators there, might<br>take Warning by him.</p>
