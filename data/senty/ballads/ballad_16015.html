	<h2>Transcription</h2>
	<p> A full Account of the barbarous&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;M U R D E R <p>That was committed on the body of MARY FRAZER, alias Adam, at<br>the West Port of Edinburgh in her own house, and who died on<br>Sunday the 3d day of July 1791, of the strokes she had received<br>the Monday before, from John Saxton and his three sisters in law,<br>who are now confined in Edinbrugh Jail<p>THE following melancholly accident ought to put people upon their guard to bridle their<br>passion, and not to suffer it' to overcome them, for passion is nothing else but a sort of<br>temporary madness, and one who give it the least indulgence, will work to themselves or those<br>who are so unlucky as to be their neighbours vexation and trouble.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  <p>Rage and anger should always be avoided; it can be of no service to those who enjoy the<br>greatest share of it; many, alas too many; pride themselves in flying into passions, giving to their<br>fellow creatures oprobrious names and abusive language, from which they proceed to blows,<br>which often ends in wounding, maiming, and too often is the occasion of either of the parties<br>death.<p>All them that are any ways addicted to quarrelling, or given to wrangling, should carefully<br>avoid drinking spiritous liquors, for a great number of the lower class of the people are very<br>much given to this abominable practise, intoxicating themselves, and afterwards casting out with<br>their neighbours, giving and receiving the most abusive names to each other, from which they<br>proceed to blows, and ten to one but murder is committed before they give themselves the least<br>time to think what they are acting or what they are about.<p> This melancholy accident which we are now going to relate, appears to be nearly allied to the<br>above description; for what else but drink or something worse than madness, could ever have<br>rempted a whole family to have fallen to beat and bruise one poor woman in the manner they<br>did.<p>It appears the deceased had some girls , and one of them having a childish quarrel with one <br>of saxton's children, the deceased came to her door and calling her daughter to come in, asked<br>her what it Was that the girl Saxton said to her; the said, she called my father a beggar man,<br>when the decesed said, you might have called her the pig-wife's daughter.<p>Saxton and his family living immediately above the deceased, and over-hearing what she said,<br>came rushing down stairs upon her, when several bad words passed on both sides, when, it seems,<br>Saxton and his three sisters-in-law, who are of the name of Menzie, fell a beating the deceased<br>in a most unmerciful manner.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <p><p>Not satisfied with what they had given her at this time, it appears that they again returned<br>and forced open the deceased's door, and again fell a beating and bruising her in a more cruel<br>end shocking manner than before.<p>The deceased lingered for a few days, vomiting blood at different times, and even thought<br>that she would have got the  better of it ; but on Sunday last, after having thrown up a good deal<br>of blood, she expired. And on Monday morning John Saxton, an out pensioner in Chelsea hos-<br>pital, and his three sisters in-law were apprehended and put in confinement in the Weft Port un-<br>til yesterday, when they were examined, and afterwards transmitted to Edinburgh jail, where<br>they now remain. Before the body was interred the Doctors opened and searched the body,<br>but what their opinion has been we have not been able exactly to learn, but it appears that it<p>has not been favourable to the prisoners,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  </p>
