	<p> CONFESSIONS<p>MADE BY<p>William Burke,<p>New under Sentence of Death, in the Calton jail, for the Harrid<br>Murder of Mrs Campbell, frankly detailing several other atrocious<br>Murders, in which he was concerned along, with Hare....Extract-<br>ed from the Caledonian Mercury, 5th January, 1829.<p>AFTER some conversation of a religious nature he was asked<br>how&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;long he  had been engaged in this murderous traffic.<br>To which he answered, from Christmas 1827 till the murder of the<br>woman Docherty in October last.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; How many persons  have you<br>murdered,  or been  concerned  in  murdering, during&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;that&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;time? <br>Were they thirty in all ?&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No, not so many ; not so many, I assure<br>you.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; How  many ? He  answered the question ; but  the  answer<br>was, for a reason satisfactory, not communicated to us, and reserved<br>for a different quarter.<p>Had you any accomplices ? None but Hare. We always took<br>cure, when we were going to commit a murder, that no one else<br>should be present...that no one else should swear he saw the deed<br>done. The women might suspect what we were about, but we always<br>put them out of the way when we were going to do it. They never<br>saw us commit any of the murders One of the murders was done<br>in Broggan's house, while he was out, but before he returned the<br>thing was finished, and the body put into a box. Broggan evidently<br>suspected something, for he appeared much agitated, and entreated<br>us ' to sake away that box,' which we accordingly did. But he was<br>not in any way concerned in it.<p>You have already told me that you were engaged in those atro-<br>cities from Christmas 1827 till the end of October 1828; Were you<br>associated with Mare during all that time ?....Yes We began<br>with selling to Di ??the body of a woman who had died a na-<br>tural death in Hare's house, We got ten pounds for it. After this<br>we began the murders, and all the rest of the bodies we sold to him<br>we murdeted. In what place were there murders generally com-<br>mitted ?....They were mostly committed in Hare's house, which was<br>very convenient for the purpose, as it consisted of a room and a<br>kitchen. Daft Jamie was murdered there. The story told of this<br>murder is incorrect, Hare began the struggle with him, and they<br>fell and rolled together on the ground ; then 1 went to Hare's assist-<br>ance, and we at length finished him, though with much difficulty.<br>I committed one murder in the country by myself. It was in last<br>harvest. All the rest were done in conjunction with Hare.<p>' By what means were these fearful atrocities perpetrated ?' ' By<br>suffocation. We made the persons drunk, and then suffocated<br>them by holding the nostrils and mouth, and getting on the body.<br>Sometimes I held the mouth and nose, while Hare went upon the<br>body ; and sometimes Hare held the mouth and nose, while I<br>placed myself on the body. Hare has perjured himself by what<br>he said at the trial about the murder of Docherty. He did not sit<br>by while I did it, as he says. He was on the body assisting me<br>with all his might, while I held the nostrils and mouth with one<br>hand, choked her under the throat with the other. We sometimes<br>used a pillow, but did not in this case. Now, Burke, answer me<br>this question?Were you tutored and instructed, or did you re-<br>ceive hints from any one as to the mode of committing murder ?<br>No, except from Hare. We often spoke about it, and we agreed<br>that suffocation was the best way. Hare said so, and I agreed<br>with him. We generally did it by suffocation. Did you receive<br>any encouragement to commit or persevere in committing these<br>atrocities ? Yes ; we were frequently told by Paterson that he<br>would take as many bodies as we could get for him. When we<br>got one, he always told us to get more. There was commonly<br>another person with him of the name of Falconer. They general-<br>ly pressed us to get more bodies for them. To whom were the<br>bodies so murdered sold ??To Dr ??.  We took the bodies to<br>his rooms in??? ???, and then went to his house to re-<br>ceive the money for them. Sometimes he paid us himself; some-<br>times we were paid by his assistants. No questions were ever<br>asked as to the mode in which we had come by the bodies. We<br>had nothing to do but to leave a body at the rooms, and go and<br>get the money.<p>Did you ever, upon any occasion, sell a body or bodies to any<br>other lecturer in this place ? Never. We knew no other.<p>You have been a resurrectionist (as it is called) I understand ?<br>No.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Neither Hare nor myself ever got a body from a church-<br>yard.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; All we sold were murdered save the first one, which was<br>that of the woman who died a natural death in Hare's house.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We<br>began with that: our crimes then commenced.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The victims we<br>selected were generally elderly persons.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They could  be more<br>easily disposed of than persons in the vigour of health.<p><br>Lamentations,<p>Confessions, &  Reffections<p>OF<p>WILLIAM&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; BURKE, late of Portsburgh, who is to<br>be Executed at Edinburgh, on the 28th January,<br>1829, for Murder, and his body given for Public<br>Dissection.<p>[The writer of the following Lines, at the solitary hour of<br>one o'clock the other morning, took a walk to the Calton Hill,<br>and laid himself down on the south side, opposite the Jail,<br>rolled up in hit mautle, reflecting on the vicissitudes of life,<br>and on the scene before him, when he heard, or imagined he<br>heard, the following Effusions from the cell at the wretched<br>Burke.]<p>" Good people all, both great and small,<br>I pray you lend an ear,<br>Unto these lines that I have penn'd,<br>Which quickly you shall hear.<p>O, if my days were to begin,<br>I to the world would show,<br>That I would shun the paths of sin,<br>Wherain destroyers go.<p>But ah ! these days are past and gone,<br>In fetters here I lie,<br>Confined in a dungeon strong,<br>By men condemned to die.<p>Because God's law I did transgress.<br>And would not walk therein,<br>But fled the paths of righteousness,<br>And trod the paths of sin,<p>These shocking murders harrass my soul,<br>Which cruelly I've committed,<br>For paltry gain, which ne'er lasts long,<br>With those who basely get it.<p>When first I began this wild career,<br>'Twas with the old pensioner,<br>Who died a natural death last year,<br>But did not obtain a sepulchre.<p>The body we brought to Surgeons Square<br>Soon got a ready market for't,<br>And encourag'd thus to bring some more,<br>The rest soon followed after it.<p>Four were chok'd in Broggan s house,<br>Though Broggan did not know,<br>And four were murder'd in my house,<br>Which caused my overthrow.<p>Six victims more in Hare's house,<br>Were suffocated too;<br>Besides two other victims in his stable,<br>Which I most sincerely rue.<p>My sentence, therefore, must be just,<br>For God's commandment says,<br>He that sheddeth another's blood,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>His blood must it appease.<p>O, therefore, holy son of God,<br>Do thou my soul relieve,<br>From God's wrath and afflicting rod,<br>That now my soul doth grieve ;<p>On thy redemption I depend,<br>O, cast me not away ;<br>But shield my soul, and me defend<br>Against the evil day.<p>PRICE ONE PENNY.</p>
