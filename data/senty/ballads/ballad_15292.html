	<h2>Transcription</h2>
	<p> Copy of Two LETTERS from the late ANDREW  HARDIE, the former written<br>to his Uncle, dated, Stirling Castle, 5th September, and the latter to his<br>Sweetheart the night preceding his Execution, dated 7th Sept. 1820. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My Dear. Relations,<p>I now write you my long and last farewell<br>letter, as I am in a short time to fall a victim<br>beneath the stroke of the tyrant, for seeking<br>those rights for which our forefathers bled, and<br>for which I shall lay down my life without the<br>least reluctance, knowing it is for the cause of<br>truth and justice. I have wronged no person<br>?I have hurt no person?and formerly been<br>of an easy temper. I bless God, who has the<br>hearts of every man in his hand, that it never<br>entered into mine to hurt any of my fellow-<br>creatures. No person could have induced me<br>to cake up arms in the same manner to rob or<br>plunder. No, my dear friends, I took them for<br>the good of my suffering country; and although<br>we were outwitted, yet I protest, as a dying<br>man, that it was with a good intention on my<br>part. But, dear friends, it becomes me, as a<br>dying man, to look over all these matters, which,<br>bless God, I can do with pleasure. If I can-<br>not forgive my enemies, or those who have in-<br>jured me, how can I expect my blessed Saviour<br>to make intercession for me, who so freely for-<br>gave his enemies?-even when expiring on the<br>cross he prayed, " Father, forgive them, they<br>for know not what they do," I could take.she<br>greatest enemy I have into my bosom, even the<p><br>Yes, my dear friends, my earnest prayer is that<br>God may forgive him. My dear friends, I<br>hope you will put yourselves to as little con-<br>cern as possible. It becomes us to submit our-<br>selves to the will of God, and to every dispen-<br>sation of his providence. He often sees the<br>most painful trial necessary?he is infinitely<br>pure?he Can do nothing wrong?he chastiseth<br>whom he loveth?and I earnestly hope and<br>pray he will sanctify this gracious dispensation<br>of his providence to one and all of us, which is<br>the earnest prayer of your unfortunate nephew<br>while on earth.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  ANDREW  HARDIE.<p>Stirling Castle, 5th Sept. 1820.<p>My Dear and Loving Margaret,<br>BEFORE this arrives to your, hand, I will be<br>made immortal, and will, I trust, be singing<br>praises to God" and the Holy Lamb, amongst<br>the spirits of just men, made perfect through<br>the atoning blood of our Lord and Saviour Je-<br>sus Christ, whose all-sufficient merit is infinite-<br>ly unbounded for all the sins of a sinful world,<br>and he is able and willing to save to the utter-<br>most all those that are enabled to come to him<br>by faith in his blood. What consolation does<br>this render unto me, who, while writing this, is<br>within a few short hours of launching into eter-<br>nity, where I am not afraid to enter, although<br>a poor, unworthy, and miserable sinner, and<p>not worthy of the least of his notice, yet I trust<br>he Will put upon me his unspotted robe of<br>righteousness, and present my poor and unwor-<br>thy soul to his father, redeemed with his most<br>precious blood. Think, my dear Margaret, on<br>the goodness of Almighty God to me in my<br>last arid closing period of my life. O think on<br>it, and draw consolation from that source<br>from which I obtained it, and from whence<br>consolation and real fortitude can be ob-<br>tained. Could you have thought that I was<br>sufficient to stand such a stroke, which at once<br>burst upon me like an earthquake, and buried<br>all my vain earthly hopes beneath its ruins, and<br>at once left me a poor shipwrecked mariner on<br>this bleak shore, and separated from the world<br>and thee, in whom all my hopes were centered.<br>But, alas ! how vain are all the earthly hopes of<br>us weak-sighted mortals ? How soon are they<br>all buried in oblivion ?<p>My dear Margaret, put yourself to no concern<br>about me. O may that good and gracious God,<br>who has supported me so peculiarly, support<br>you also in every dispensation of his provi-<br>dence that he is pleased to visit you with. O<br>that he may send his ministering angels, and<br>soothe you with the balm of comfort.  O may<br>they approach the beauteous mourner, and tell<br>you that your love lives triumphantly, lives<br>though condemned, lives to a nobler life !<p>My dear Margaret, I hope that you will not take it for a dis-<br>honour that your unfortunate lover died for his distressed and<br>suffering country. No, my dear Margaret, I know you are<br>possessed of nobler ideas than that, and well do I know that no<br>person of feeling or humanity will insult you with it. I have<br>every reason to believe that it will be the contrary. I shall die<br>firm to the' cause which I took up arms to defend; and, although<br>we were outwitted and betrayed, yet I protest, as a dying man,<br>that it was done with a good intention on my part. But you<br>know my sentiments on that subject long before I was taken<br>prisoner. No person could have induced me to take up arms<br>to rob or plunder. No, my dear Margaret, I took them up <p>But, my dear Margaret, this is not a very pleasant subject  to<br>you. I will leave it, and direct your attention to matters of<br>more importance?to the one thing needful. Recollect, my<br>dear Margaret, that we are one and all of us lost and miserable<br>sinners, and that you have, as well as me to stand before a<br>just and good God, who is infinite and pure, and that he can-<br>not look upon the least sin but with the utmost abhorrence, and<br>that it is only through the blood of a crucified Saviour that we<br>can expect mercy at his just and most awful tribunal. My dear<br>Margaret, I will be under the necessity of laying; down my pen,<br>as this will have to go out immediately.<p>O  may  God's grace your life direct,<p>From evil guard your way,<br>And in temptation's fatal path,<br> Permit you not to stray.<p>You will give my dying love to your father and mother,<br>James and Agnes, Mrs Connell, and Jean Buchanan, and I ex-<br>hort you all to a close walk with God, through our blessed<br>Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ; and, when you have fulfilled a<br>course of life agreeable to his word, that we may be united to-<br>gether in the mansions of peace, where there is no sorrow.<p>Farewell, farewell, a long farewell to you, and all worldly<br>cares, for I have done with them ! I hope you will frequently<br>call on my distressed and afflicted mother. At the expence of<br>some tears, I have destroyed your letters. Again farewell, my<br>dear Margaret ! May God attend you still, and all your soul<br>with consolation fill, is the sincere prayer of your affectionate<br>lover while on earth,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  ANDREW HARDIE.<p><p>Re-printed in Edinburgh--PRICE ONE PENNY.</p>
