	<p> EXECUTION OF JAMES CAMPBELL FOR<p>HOUSEBREAKING & THEFT.<p>GLASGOW, 16th MAY, 1831.<p>This Morning JAMES  CAMPBELL underwent the last sentence of the law, pur<br>suant to his sentence at the last Circuit Court, for breaking into the cellar-store of<br>Messrs. Watson, M'Night & Co., situated in George Street on the 23d February<br>last, and stealing therefrom four boxes and a basket full of cotton yarn. It appeared<br>from the evidence that this unfortunate young man, along with Thomas Fisher who<br>was sentenced to be  executed with him, but who has since got his punishment com-<br>mitted to transportation for life, and  other two, who  were dismissed, had gone to the<br>evening of the day above mentioned and wrenched  off a padlock which covered the<br>locP, and  then opened the door with a false  key, when Campbell and Fisher were <br>detected in the very act of carrying out the fourth box, and putting it on a barrow.<br>When observed by the porters of the celler they immediately ran away, but were<br>closely  pursued and apprehended a short distance from  the place.<p>Campbell, who appears to be about 37 years of age,  is a native of Glasgow, and de-<br>scended from very respectable patents, who gave him a liberal education?(his mo-<br>ther is  still alive)?and it is a very singular and remarkable circumstance that he has <br>been twice under sentence of death in this city, frist in September 1822, for house<br>breaking and theft. An application was afterwards made to Government for a com-<br>mutation of his  sentence, which was granted, on condition of his being transported<br>for life. The moment he received the intimation of it he fell down upon his house<br>and offered up a solemn thanksgiving to Almighty God, with a servent acknowledg<br>ment of his sense of the morev thus in prospect for him and of his obligations to<br>those gentlemen who had interested themselves in his favour, and expressed his de-<br>termination in the event of his life being spared of making reparation to his God and,<br>his country for the sins of his past life. But ah ! how soon the religious impressions<br>which were at that time administered to him by the many religious persons who at-<br>tended have been effaced from his heart, which, was at that that time considered to<br>be susceptible of receiving lasting impressions of the goodness of God to man, and<br>the Way of salvation through Jesus Christ.<p>He was never sent out of the country, having been kept on board the hulks for the<br>last eight years, Where, it is said, he acted in the capacity of teacher; and, by his good<br>behaviour, eventually received his  Majesty's pardon, when he returned to Glasgow,<br>and having renewed an intimacy with some of his old companions, and others of a<br>similar description, began afresh to commit depredations which, in 1822, he had re-<br>solved and re- resolved never to harbour a thought of for a single moment. Camp-<br>bell has a brother at present lying in our Jail, who had a very narrow escape at the<br>last Circuit from a similar fate, had it not been owing to the leniency of the Advc-<br>cate-Depute in restricting the libel, and he was sentenced to transportation for life.<br>He has been assiduously attended by the the Rev. Dr. Muir of St. James's, the<br>Rev. Mr. Fisher, Chaplain to the Jail, and a number of other pious individuals, to all<br>whose instructions he listened with  the most marked attention.<p>At the usual time in the morning. the prisoner was brought into the Hall, and<br>shortly  afterwards proceeded to the scaffold, where a short time being spent in prayer<br>by Mr. Muir, in which  the prisoner joined, and the executioner  having adjusted the  <br>rope, he gave the signal, and this world closed upon him ever.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The crowd was<br>very great.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<p>Reader-Thus has terminated in ignominy, not withstanding his repeated warn-<br>ings and former very narrow escape, the days of one  who, but for his crimes, might<br>have spent many years of happiness. Thus has one more been cut off in the mid-day<br>of life, by the strong hand of justice. How true, even in a limited sense, is the Scrip,<br>ture, When it saith, " the wages of sin it death."&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Reader, whatever be thy condi-<br>tion, the sad spectacle before you ought not to be without in lesson.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Are you  pur-<br>suing like courses with him who has just now paid the forfeit of his crime?&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Are you<br>living on the fruits of  dishonesty?&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Are you spending your days in Idleness and your<br>nights in  debauchery? Do you despise the ways of honesty and the paths of industry<br>Do you shun  the counsel of the godly; and the pattern of the virtuous ? And do you<br>seek to hide your own individual crimes in the congregation of the wicked ?&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If you<br>are one of this character, the victim now before you speaks, and should you neglect<br>the dread admonition,  he event of this day shall yet rise  up&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;against you in  judg-<br>ment. Fly ungodliness  shun evil company as shou wouldst do contagion; be in<br>dustrions, honest and sober;  seek instruction from your Bible ; directions from the<br>counsels of  the godly, and beg for grace and mercy by earnest and repeated prayer.<p>Reader?You may flatter yourself like the Pharase of Scripture, that you are<br>not like the unhappy felon ; but how many  are there, while  they do not openly vio-<br>late human law, yet are living without God and hope  in the world. Do you never,<br>deceive your neighbour to promote your gain? Do you never cover your deceit with<br>falsehood? Do you never take the name of your God in vain ? Do you never break<br>the holy Sabbath?  Do you never yield to debauchery, and indulge, in idle and vicions<br>conversation?  Reader, know then, that the progress of crime is " as the letting is<br>of water." The victim who  now expired before you, could remember the time,<br>when he would have shrunk from the commission of such crimes as those for which<br>he suffered.. How many who have suffered on the same scaffold, and others who are<br>yet their followers in crimes, could date their ruin from Sabbaths violated?from the<br>cou[  ] of parents, disregarded- and from sobriety neglected.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<p>Reader?If thou be one who  has chosen  the good part, let the sad spectacle<br>redouble your vigour, with God's blessnig go forward in the work of tenderness,<br>and may you, in the hands of the mighty ruler of all things, be honoured instrument<br>of plucking, many life brands from the burning<p>The following is an interesting description of the manner in which criminal.<br>were wont to be executed in Glasgow. at the ownhead.  The unceremonious, quick,<br>morning despatch, is certainly no improvement on the solemn and affecting ceremo-<br>nial adopted by our forefathers:-"The criminal was led out from the old prison at<br>the Cross, arrayed in a loose dress of white linen, with  trimming of black. His<br>arms  being pinioned, he took his station  at the end of a cart, on which lay extended<br>the Coffin, of  shell, in which, his body  was About to be deposited. He had an open<br>Bible in his hand, and was  usually attended by one or two clergymen, who cacouraged<br>him is his devotions by the way and aded him in his  preparations for eternity. The<br>Magistrates of the city. prece and by the  the Town officers with thier halberts, and ac-<br>companied by a strong milita yguard  formed the procession. On its arrival at the<br>Bell of the Brae it stood still when occasionally a verse or two of a psalm were sung,<br>the malefactor himself giving out  the line,  and the multitude raising their hats from<br>their heads in token,of sympathy, while every window adjacent was crowded with<br>spectators. This affecting ceremony was sometimes performed in front of the Alms<br>House in Kirk street, where the tremulous notes of the  criminal were intermingied<br>with the plaintive intonations of the passing bell; and the whole catastrophe was<br>summed up by  psalm and a prayer, and frequently a last speech, at the place of<br>excution since 1814 till this period, there have  been executed in  front of the<br>nev prison no less than 50 individuals!!&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;John Muir, printer.</p>
