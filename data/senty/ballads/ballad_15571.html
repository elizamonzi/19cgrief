	<p> SECOND&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;EDITON.<br>CASE OF SUPPOSED <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  MURDER<p>  OF a CHILD.<p>Full, True, and particular account of<br>the&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;apprehension&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of  that&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;unfortunate<p>young woman, on the charge of killing<br>her own intant child, which was found<br>dead is a coal cellar, on Friday last, in<br>Heward Place ; also an account of her<br>commitment to the Calton Jail, to await<br>her tried for the alleged Murder.<p>Taken from this day's North Briton.<br>Yesterday a well dressed looking woman was<br>brought to the Police office on a charge of having<br>bean concerned in the death of her female child,<br>which was born on the morning previous. The<br>wretohed creature, we are informed, had con-<br>cealed her pregnancy, but the body of the child<br>having been discovered in the coal cellar, led to<br>her immediate apprehension. However the guilt<br>at innecence of the mother may be proved, after<br>investigation into this mysterious affair we cannot<br>help considering the extreme haste on the part of<br>authorities in her hasty removal after delivery, as<br>bordering inhumanity. A watchman might have<br>been stationed at her resinence, at no great expence<br>to the public, until a decent time bad been affor-<br>ded for her recovery ; and we do not think, the ends<br>of justice or humanity will be forwarded if this<br>poor creatore pays the forfeit of her life to satisfy<br>the " law's delay," in arriving at what may per-<br>haps turn out to be the case of a still-born child<br>FURTHER PARTicULArS?We have seen the<br>different Edinburgh Newspapers of to day, but<br>none of them furnish us with any further accounts<br> of this lementable case. We understand that the<br>unfortunate young woman was a servant in one<br>of the Crescents in the New Town From the weak<br>ness of her present Situation, no examination has yet<br>taken place, but likely we will be able to give a<br>lengthened account on Monday.<p>SECOND EDITION.<p>(Taken from this morning's Caledonian; Mercury,<br>February 13.)<p><p>We understand that the article in the North<br>Briton of Saturday last, regarding a servant girl<br> who had been delivere of a child in Howard Place,<br>is in some respects incorrect. The Police never<br>heard of nor saw her till she was brought to the<br>head office in a carriage by order of her master<br>in charge of a constable.<p>No person, we believe, of whatever description,<br>is removed to the police office, if complaining,<br>without first being examined by the medical of-<br>ficer of the establishment. In the case alluded to,<br>very marked attention was paid to this unfortun-<br>ate creature, both as to proper food, bedding, and<br>a well heated room.<p>She was removed last night to the Calton Jail<br>for trial.<p></p>
