	<h2>Transcription</h2>
	<p> This&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;is&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;acquaint the&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;P U B L I C,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<p>That lately arrived in this Town from&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;BEVERLEY,<br>The very celebrated Dr. Puff  Stuff Sham Quirko Ye - Trick,<p>PHYSICIAN to the sole Governor of the Earth, the most Magnanimous<br>and Puissant Chou Khan, Emperor of China; Professor of Magic,<br>Physic, Surgery, and Anatomy,in the University of Pekin; Occulist<br>and Dentist to all the Monarchs of the East; Man-Midwife to the<br>Empress Pinka Panka; and Menber of every Medical Society through-<br>out  the vast Empires of China Persia, Turkey,, and Indostan.<p>THE Doctor having enjoyed these ngh honours in his native country, and being<br>chief Favourite and Counsellor to the Emperor, was converted to Christianity by a<br>learned Missionary, and obliged to make his escape in an open boat, in which, after a<br>long and perilous voyage, he arrived at the Cape of Good Hope, from whence he took<br>shipping for England.<p>This may be considered as the most fortunate event that ever happened to the inhabi-<br>tants of Europe, as the Doctor has brought with him the following inestimable secrets :<p>First The most surprising balsam, called Paramandelang Rattskiammum, brought<br>from Whangwagngang, situated thirty degrees beyond the South Pole, which only be-<br>ing rubbed  on the gums for five minutes, will cause an entire new set of teeth to sprout<br>up instantly, to the amazement of all the beholders. The Doctor has invented a ma-<br>chine, by which he can extract the old sett in the tenth part of a moment, without the<br>patient feeling him.<p>Secondly, He performs the most astonishing operations upon the eyes, and has a cer-<br>tificate under the hand and seal of his Siamese Majesty who having loft his fight by the<br>formation of cataracts in each eye, sent an embassy to China, requesting the Emperor's<br>permission for the Doctor to visit him at Siam. On his arrival, he, with skill unpa-<br>a particular glutinous application, he dextrously inserted a pair of eyes taken out of the<br>head of a living lion, by which means not only his Majesty's vision is perfectly restored,<br>but he has acquired such a ferocity of countenance, as makes him terrible to all his enemies.<br>Thirdly, The illustrious ointment called Syang Yang Ching Quey Tschenmencow<br>(prepared from the marrow of the humning-birds, and invented by Li Laokum, who<br>lived five thousand years before the date, of the Mosaic creation, and from whom the<br>Doctor is descended in a right line) this ontment being applied to the stump of a leg or<br>arm which,has been cut off, will immeciately cause a regeneration of the parts which<br>have been destroyed, so that the patient shall in five days have as perfect a foot or hand<br>as he had before the operation.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <p>Fourthly, That restorative root which. contributes so greatly to the population of the<br>Chinese empire, in so much that by the constant use of it the Empress Purka Panka,<br>though in her eightieth year, continued to bring forth children when the Doctor left<br>China, and, in the last labour in which he attended her, he delivered her of seven living<br>children, each as large as any European when new born, without her sublime Highness<br>having a single pain, by a method peculiar to himself; also, from happy experience, in-<br>fallibly cures a diabetes, although of many years continuance.<p>He has also brought over the method  of bandaging, by which the Chinese ladies con-<br>fine their feet to that beautiful-smallness, has to be soarcely equal to the size of the great<br>toe-nail of an English woman.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<p>The Doctor begs leave to mention his most sovereign Balsamum anti-mortale<br>pseuda-medicale, extracted from the breath of the Egyptian mummies. This balsam is<br>of Arabian fragrance, and kept in Pandora's box, which, on being, opened, and held<br>to the evil, cancer, fistula, schirrous swellings, or cutaneous affections, does imme-<br>diately (with the Doctor's elocution, and the effluvia of a butter market) occasion such a<br>cloud of morbid vapours to arise from the diseased parts as dims the fight of the won-<br>dering spectators; but how much the greater is their surprise, to see, in a week or ten<br>days time, these deluded Lazari compliment the Doctor, and apologise for their credu-<br>lity, by avowedly declaring their complaints near well, themselves Dupes, and the<br>Doctor no Fool.</p>
