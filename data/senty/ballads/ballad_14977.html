	<h2>Transcription</h2>
	<p> THE  CAMLACHIE  MILITIA.<p>PRICE ONLY ONE PENNY.<p>This fine song is sung, with the most unbounded applause, by that comical of all comic singers, Mr Charles Watson, in the Shakspere<br>Saloon, Glasgow. The rapturous encores, with which he is nightly greeted, show how much he is loved by those who appreciate the<br>Muse, and admire original talent of a high character. Now that the Lancashire Militia has arrived in Glasgow, on the 11 th instant<br>the Poet expects a great run to the Box for this funny song, the address of which is [  ].<p>Air?The Campbell's are Coming.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  <p>The Russians are coming, oh, dear ! oh, dear !<br>Well, let them come on, we have nothing to fear ;<br>The war is declared?you can now volunteer?<br>There's nought like the Militia, that is very clear.<br>There's something about us, if I don't mistake,<br>That is sure for to make the Russians quake ;<br>So don't stand for drawing?pray where is the good ??<br>But join the Militia to give 'em first blood.<p>SPOKEN?Blood  I should think we would give them first blood<br>for if they come here they shall find us regular malicious men. Since<br>they as-saulted us, they shall find we'll give them pepper. You may<br>laugh at the dress, but its made of pepper and salt, just to let you<br>know we're well seasoned, and ready to cook the Bear's goose : and<br>now we're muster'd. we'll tip it him hot and strong, and no mistake.<br>We'll never leave him till he's dune brown ; so what's the use of<br>waiting to be drawn ?  Why don't you volunteer at once ? If you<br>wait to be drawn, you'll be as bad as a badger?he won't connt out<br>till he's drawn ; if you wait to be drawn, you'll be as bad as the hot<br>rolls?they won't come out till they're drawn ; if you wait to be<br>drawn you'll be as bad as a goose?for that's no good till its drawn.<br>Now, I volunteer'd first, was drawn afterwards, and now I'm quite<br>satisfied with my quarters. So, come my jolly dogs?join with us<br>to try and give the Bear a good baiting.<p>So join the Militia, lads?come, my lads, come?<br>And boldly well march to the fife and the drum ;<br>All the world very soon of us they shall hear?<br>There's none like the Militia it is very clear.<p>So, cheer my lads, cheer?come, don't be afraid,<br>Yon'll get plenty of grub, besides you are paid ;<br>One volunteer is worth two that they press,<br>And if that don't entice you just look at the dress.<br>So keep a good heart lads, and don't be forlorn,<br>If you don't volunteer you're sure to be drawn ;<br>You can all die but once, lads, wherever you be?<br>Come, get up the steam?here, just look at me !<p>SPOKEN -Talk about getting the steam up, just look at me ! Now,<br>You civilians, you are all soldiers, only yon don't know it ! Now,<br> I just appeal to the married men if it aint so ? There, now !<br>They say silence gives consent, so it must be so?besides, I'll prove<br>ft.  If you aint under a Drill Sergeant you're under a White Ser-<br>geant,  and a  a jelly good drilling you get if you fall out of the ranks.<br>Or If you stopabsent  without leave -where are you then ? or  if you<br>don't attend to your duty?where are you then ? Aint  you marched<br>and counter-marched then ; and if you offend your wife, see how<br>jolly soon she'll put you to the right-about ! Hey ! but ours is the<br>drill This  morning Sergeant says  to a chap, "Tention,"?the<br>stop  says,Well, gie it us, men."&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Give  you  what ? " say, Ser-<br>geant Why, tenpencel " says  chap. 'Gad, be thought he were<br>going to give him tenpence ! Then Sergeant says to another,<br>" Stand at ease ; " chap says, " I shan't." Sergeant he were going<br>to knock him down with the butt end of the gun, but he didn't. So,<br>Sergeant says, " What, sir, won't you stand at case ? " " Oh," he<br>says, " I thought you said, Stand and freeze, and I should happen<br>had to stand here till Christmas !" Sergeant and I laughed, and.<br>egad, they all laughed. I tell thee what, chaps, Militia man's the<br>best thing in the world. Don't they say, there's nothing like<br>leather. Well, if you join, you'll always have plenty of leather?<br>round your neck. Its best dodge in the world for anybody as wants<br>to open a shop to join the militia, for they always give you a good<br>stock to begin with.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  Chorus.<p>Then think of the honour you'll get with your pals,<br>And think of the name you'll get with the gals;<br>And think of the dress you'll march out in so grand ,<br>And they'll call you brave fellows to fight for our land,<br>So come and we'll show you how to shoulder a gun?<br>Come along, and we'll soon make Russians to run ;<br>If they come over here we've got nothing to do,<br>But to run against them and we'll quick run "em thro'.<p>SPOKEN?I should think we would run 'em through !&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now, I'll<br>just give you the new style of drill. When the  Drill Sergeant says,<br>"Shoulder arms." that means that you musn't be too lazy to work<br>for your own living.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  When he says, "Carry arms," that means<br>a helping hand to a nuse your own kids--when you got' em.<br>When he says, " Present arms," that means you must always lend<br>a helping hand to a fellow when he is in need. When he says,'<br>' Recover arms," that means you should always bekind to a fellow-<br>foe, and never hit a chap when he's down. When he says " Secure<br>arms," that means you must take jolly good care to hold your wife's<br>hands  precious tight when she's going to claw your face, When he<br>says, " Prime and load," that means you must prime your heads<br>with knowledge, your hearts with kindness, and take jolly good<br>care to load your pockets with plenty of money, and then you'll<br>always be right, and that you're sure to have if you join the Militia ;<p>For there's glory in store,<br>With prize money galore ;<br>And though at the dress some may sneer,<br>See thee, lads, the pluck it lies here ;<br>Let 'em remember this if they can?<br>It's not the coat makes the man.<br>You shall find our courage is right?<br>We're not dress'd to show but to fight.<br>While to battle abroad the Regulars do roam,<br>See What stunning fine chaps will protect you at home,<br>And tho' some may smile, yet remember these words,<br>It's not always fine feathers that does make fine birds,<br>But I hope ere long our deeds will be seen,<br>So success to Camlachie Militia, and Queen !<p>Poets  Box, the Grand Temple of the Muse Saturday Morning  January&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;13,1855.</p>
