	<h2>Transcription</h2>
	<p> A Full and Particular Account of the Riot which<br>took place in Edinburgh on Thursday last; also<br>of the Hoax played off on a Celebrated Doctor.<br>" POPULAR TUMMULT,....On Thursday, a number<br>of people, who had assembled about the Calton,<br>were observed to come up Leith Street and pass<br>along both the Bridges, southward, bearing an<br>Effigy of a certain Doctor, who has been rendered<br>very obnoxious to the public by recent events.<br>The figure was pretty well decked out in a suit of<br>good cloths, and the face and head bore a tolerable<br>resemblance to the person intended to be represent-<br>ed On the back was a label bearing the words<br>" Knox, the associate of the infamous Hare." In<br>passing along the South Bridge a policeman, a re-<br>solute fellow, attempted singly to stem the torrent<br>And pull the figure from those carrying it, but fail-<br>ed receiving some severe blows for his boldness<br>The crowd, which increased rapidly, proceeded on-<br>ward to Newington, where the figure was suspend<br>ed by the neck from a tree, fire being also put to<br>it, but which soon went out. The figure was then<br>torn to pieces, amidst the loud huzzas of thousands,<br>Up to this period no actual violence had been com-<br>mitted, but the appearance of the crowd was very<br>threatening, the whole flower-plot and railing in<br>front of the Doctor's house being literally packed<br>with people, who were shouting in a wrathful man-<br>ner?blending the names of the 'West Port murder- '<br>ers with that of the medical gentleman so often<br>alluded to, as connected with those horrid transac-<br>tions. Captain Stewart, the Superintendent of the<br>Police, and a superior officer of another department<br>of the establishment, having out-run the main body<br>of watchmen,-and having got admission to the<br>house from the rear, made a determined charge<br>from the front door, upon the crowd, who instant-<br>ly retreated to the road and commenced throwing<br>stones, whereby Mr Stewart and the other gentle-<br>men were considerably injured, but no farther riot-<br>ing then took place, and no property was destroy-<br>ed beyond a pane or two of glass broken. This<br>mob, which may be said to have consisted princi-<br>pally of boys and young lads, among whom eight<br>or ten bakers seemed the most active, quietly dis-<br>persed, but re-assembled in different parts of the<br>city. A crowd, mostly boys, assembled in Prince's<br>Street, and, armed with sticks, paraded the High<br>Street, but did no mischief, having encountered a<br>body of the police at the Tron Church, by whom<br>they were dispersed. Another mob collected in the<br>West Port, came down the Grassmarket and Cow-<br>gate, and went up the Horse Wynd, breaking a<br>number of panes of glass in the windows on the<br>west and south sides of the College. A third crowd<br>had collected about the Cowgate, where several of<br>the most active were apprehended. But, notwith-<br>standing all the efforts of the police, the mob,again<br>attacked the house of Dr Knox- about seven o'clock,<br>when a great number of windows were broken,<br>both in his house and those adjoining. An attempt<br>was also made on Surgeon Square, but a party of<br>police, under the direction of Mr Kerr, completely<br>repelled the attack. Upon the whole, the police<br>never appeared more vigilant or more successful in<br>preserving the peace, They apprehended about 20<br>of the most active, were to be brought before the<br>Sitting Magistrate."? Edinburgh Evening Conrant.<p>An ANATOMIST HOAXED-- A well known carter in Leith had<br>the misfortune to lose, when in the straw, a brood sow the other<br>day, to the unspeakable grief of a host of young piglings who<br>Had, perhaps been rather prematurely ushered into this world<br>of woe;  and in consequence of the large sums which he had<br>heard were in the habit of being given for bodies, it occurred to<br>him that he might realize something for behoof of the growing<br>family by disposing of the corps of their lamented and amiable<br>mother. Accordingly he had the body scraped and prepared,<br>and forthwith repaired to Surgeon Square, with the subject care-<br>fully packed up in a box, and actually sold it to a certain cele-<br>brated lecturer for L.8, The doctor, however, had only L.5<br>upon him, which he gave to the body-dealer in the meantime,<br>and promised to pay him the balance on the morrow. This sum<br>the wag pocketed, and it is unnecessary to add, that he has  not<br>visited the Square since,?being satisfied, we believe, that, he <p>had received ample remuneration for the body given."
