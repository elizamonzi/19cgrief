	<p> E X E C U T I O N<p>Of Allan Mair, an old man of 80, for the Murder of Mary Fletcher, aged 85.<br>at Candie End, or Curshort, parish of Muiravonside, who suffered at Stir-<br>ling, this morning, Oct. 4, 1843, together with his behaviour in the Con.<br>demned Cell.<p>STIRLING, October 4, 1843<p>This morning the awful spectacle was exhibited to the view of a vast con-<br>course of spectators, o the Execution of Allan Mair, a man aged eighty four<br>years of age, who was convicted of the Murder of his Wife, Mary Fletcher or<br>Mair, at Candie End or Curshort parish of Muiravonside, on the night of<br>Sunday the 14th, or morning of Monday the 15th May last, by beating her<br>with a stick or other weapon, by which she came by her death.?:Fletcher was<br>eighty five years of age<p>Mair solemnly declared his innocence of the crime of which he was found<br>guilty, insisting that the evidences adduced on his trial had perjured them-<br>selves,and nothing seemed for some time capable of convincing him but that<br>he had been unjustly condemned.<p>As some of our readers may not have read any of the evidence, we give the<br>following, which we think is pretty decisive as to his guilt :?<p>Helen Bennie or Nimmo?Knows Mair, and identified him Mair came<br>to reside there in May, 1842 Had a woman that had stopt with him thirty<br>years. Heard her say so on the 14nh May last She passed as his reputed<br>wife. Her name was Mary .Fletcher She died on the 16th May, at four o'-<br>clock. Witness was with her when she died, and Was in the constant habit of<br>seeing her since she came to reside there. Visited her ones or twice a day.<br>Told witness she was eighty-five years old Looked fully that age. Deceas-<br>ed Could not walk well?had got a hurt on her back Deceased never was<br>unwell but once while there, and this was about the New Year. Said that she<br>did not get her victuals as she ought from Mair. Said so in Mair s presence.<br>Panel gave deceased some abusive language, and wished she was in hell and<br>her soul burning. Never knew them want victuals out of the house, but ho<br>kept them locked up. Many a time he starved her, but witness always gave<br>her something to eat, and some of the neighbours did so too; but this was al-<br>ways done when panel was out Deceased seemed a well-disposed person.?<br>Mair always abused her, and often wished she was Dead. Deceased often said<p>We could live like the king on the throne, although we are poor, if you<br>were good to me.' Saw her on the 14th of May at 7 at night, and gave her<br>some supper the told me something that made me get up and put on my<br>clothes, and go with her, and I heard the cry of murder. Knew deceased's<br>voice. Heard the strokes Was distant a few yards. Heard the cries re-<br>peated, and the blows continued. I went to the door. The blows were very<br>heavy, like the blows of a hammer, When witness wa  at the front,she heard<br>deceased say to Mair, ' Let me lie, and die in peace, and don't strike me any<br>more' "saw her next morning about seven Panel opened the door and said<br>deceased had been fighting with the bed doors ail night, and breaking them.<br>Witness spoke mildly to him, as she was a raid, and asked him what alled<br>him at her. Panel said he had got no sleep with her smashing them. Said<br>be was going down to the manse with the key, and to tell the minister to<br>make a snuff-box of his wife. Witness had taken some tea for her, and went<br>to bed and did not see her, and asked him what he had done with her, as she<br>was not there. Panel swore at her and said 'where could the be?' Witness<br>looked again, and she was crouched up at the foot of the bed. She had a<br>cap on, and an old piece of cotton cloth about her shoulders. The front of<br>her shift was all blood. Her arms were bare, Saw a deal of blood about the<br>bed When I offered her the tea, she was not able to lift her right hand but<br>could move the other. She took some of it and pointed to Allan, and said it<br>was him that did that, meaning the bruises she had got, and I sent tor a po-<br>lice officer anil got the pannel into custody Deceased was alive at the, time,<br>but I thought she died of the wounds received.<p>It appears that he had entertained the idea of self-destruction, by abstaining<br>from food, which he actually did tor four or five days after the passing of his<br>sentence, but the cravings of nature became too much to withstand, and he<br>afterwards partook of his victuals freely.<p>He was in hopes ot a mitigation of ins sentence, till Thursday morning fast,<br>when an answer to his memorial was received from the secretary of State,<br>stating that no hopes of mercy might be expected; Mair, on hearing this,<br>said, ' Weel, I maun submit.'<p>He was assisted in his spiritual concerns by the Rev. Mr Stark, chaplain<br>ol the Jail, the Rev. Messrs Gilfillan, Leitch, Watson, and Harper, and rea-<br>dily entered into conversation with them, and exhibited considerable acquain-<br>tance with the truths of the Gospel,,and sometimes manifested bursts of feel-<br>ing of a ver strong nature, more resembling those of youth than at hoary,<br>age hardened Into seared ness.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <p>About eight o'clock the magistrates entered the Court Hall, and the pri-<br>soner soon after, supported by two individuals,and attended by the foregoing<br>clergymen, who assisted him at his devotions, which being finished, he shortly<br>afterwards ascended the scaffold, and almost immediately thereafter the signal<br>was given?the drop fell?and after a few convulsive struggles, the world<br>closed upon the wretched man for ever.<p>Muir, Printer,Glasgow.</p>
