	<h2>Transcription</h2>
	<p> full and Particular Account of the Trial and Sen-<br>tence of ROBERT SCOTT, who is to be Execut-<br>ed at the spot where he committed the horrid deed,<br>on Wednesday 29th October, 1823, for the barbar-<br>ous Murder of James Aitcheson, Cooper, and Ro-<br>bert, Sim, Horse-dealer, Greenlaw, on the road near<br>Earlston, on the 30th of June last, and his Body to<br>be sent to Dr MUNRO, Edinburgh, for Dissection.<p>On Tuesday the 16th September, 1823, came on, before the<br>Circuit Court of Justiciary, at Jedburgh, the trial of RO-<br>BE.RT SCOTT, Game-keeper, accused of " wickedly, maliciously,<br>and feloniously attacking and assaulting the deceased James Aitche-<br>son, cooper in Greenlaw, and county of Berwick, and the deceased<br>Robert Sim, horse-dealer in Greenlaw aforesaid, and did, with a<br>sheep-stake, or bludgeon, or stone, or some, other lethal weapon, to<br>the prosecutor unknown, cruelly and barbarouely inflict various<br>severe blows and wounds upon the persons of the said James<br>Aitchison and Robert Simm, whereby the head and left leg of the<br>said Robert Simm, were fractured and broken, and the head of the<br>said James Aitchison was severely wounded; and did, likewise,<br>with a knife, or other sharp instrument, to the prosecutor unknown,<br>in a cruel and barbarous manner, cut and slit the noses of the said<br>James Aitchison and Robert Simm ; in consequence of all which<br>they were both bereaved of life," &c.<p>To which the prisoner replied, " No, my Lord, they attacked<br>me, and I am not Guilty," and bowed reapectfully. Witnesses<br>were then called, the two first proved, that the deceased and the<br>prisoner had been quarrelling on the road, and that the latter's face<br>had been bleeding. The third witness deponed, I was at Earlstoun<br>fair on the 30th of June last, and on my road home overtook the<br>prisoner between seven and eight o'clock in the evenidg. Broom-<br>field and Stark were near him, and so were Simm and Aitcheson.<br>The Prisoner told me that Sim and Aitcheson abused him. Neither<br>Broomfield nor Stark made any observation when he said so. I con-<br>tinued with the prisoner, Aitcheson, and Sim, for some time, and<br>then went on with Stark and Broomfield, who, however, left me on<br>our approaching Fans. I observed Sim and Aitcheson washing the<br>prisoner's face at a well near Fans, but saw no more of them till<br>they came to my own house, which is situated towards the of the<br>east-end of the village. It was now near nine o'clock. The pri-<br>soner ordered me to take Simm into custody, but I refused, telling<br>him I neither had authority, nor saw any occasion for it, and advi-<br>sed them to go home good friends. Simm and Aitcheson did ac-<br>cordingly walk away after having shaken hands with me. When<br>the prisoner wanted Simm taken into custody, the latter said he<br>was willing to go before any person he chose. Simm and Aitche-<br>son were out of sight before the prisoner left my door. He then<br>went a few yards along the road, but returned with a bundle he had<br>in his hand, and said he would thank me to keep it till he called<br>for it. He assigned no reason for leaving the bundle. On going<br>away, he took hold of the spar of a gate, with the intention as I<br>thought of pulling it off, but sueeed. When he was gone, 1 stood<br>speaking awhile to George Mercer, joiner in Fans, when, on going<br>east the road a little, we heard some cries. I then said to Mercer,<br>" They have got quite forward, we will just return again." On<br>our way back to Fans we met Philip Duff, and Mercer told him<br>that some persons had had words upon the road, and as he was<br>afraid of mischief happening, he advised him to push on and pre-<br>vent its taking place. Andrew Robertson is a mason, and resides<br>at Henless. I saw him between ten and eleven oclock, about an<br>hour and a half after the prisoner had left my house, and he told<br>me that one man had been killed on the moor, and another was fast<br>dying, and desired me to call assistants and go east. I did so, but<br>the men had by this time been removed to Lightfield.<p>Several other witnesses were examined in support of the charge,<br>whose evidence having been gone through, Mr Dundas addressed<br>the Jury for the crown, and Mr Lockhart for the prisoner. Lord<br>Pitmilly recapitulated the evidence, and gave a most clear, distinct,<br>and impressive charge to the Jury, who retired from the court, and<br>who, in about 8 minutes, returned, finding, by an unanimous ver-<br>dict, the prisoner Guilty. The Judge, next day, pronounced on the<br>unhappy man, the awful sentence of the law, which was," that<br>he should be, on Wadnesday, the 29th day of October, next,|deliver-<br>ed over by the Sheriffs of Roxburghshire, to the Sheriffs of Ber-<br>wickshire, to be by them taken to the most convenient place for<br>execution, near to the spot where the murders were committed, and<br>there hanged by the neck till he be dead, and afterwards the body<br>to be given to Dr. Monro for dissection."<p>Edinburgh: Printed for Allan Grant...
