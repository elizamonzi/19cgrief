Liberty! nay, to the shame<br>Of all that went before us;<br>Wherever we Plant, TRADE shall be free, <br>In three Years time, I plainly foresee,<br>GOD BLESS THE SCOTTISH-COMPANY<br>Shall be the Indian-Chorus.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  <p>No Brawle, no Murmure, no Ccmplaint,<br>No Cause of any Discontent,<br>Where Patersonian-Government<br>Shall once commence a Footing;<br>His wholesome Laws being publish'd there,<br>Shall harmeless keep their Goods and Gear,<br>And free their Persons from all Fear<br>Of Thummikin or Booting.<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  <br>The Muscovite, Tartar, Turk and the Pope,<br>The Sophi, Mogul, and Morocco, I hope,<br>To the Charm of our Laws must yeild and give up,<br>Their absolute Sway and Dominions:<br>Then the Spainiards, and French, and Portugueze,<br>Venetians and Dutch, and Genoese,<br>And th' English themselves perhaps may please<br>To alter their narrow Opinions.<p>The Gospel in the INDIES well propagate,<br>But not by such Ways as attempted of Late,<br>By Jesuits-Guile, nor vain pompous State,<br>Nor bloody inquisition<br>There's one way more yet left for Us,<br>A way Divine and Glorious,<br>Which can not fail; and that is thus:<br>By Peace, Love, and Contrition.<p>Then Sawny, and Johnny, and Jemmy, and all,<br>Whose Names are Enrol'd in the INDIAN-HALL,<br>Prepare and be ready to answer the Call<br>Of our brave Sea-Commanders:<br>Come follow me quiclly, our Admiral is gone<br>On board of SAINT-INDREW, I've heard a Gun,<br>You belong to the NEPTUN, and I to the SUN,<br>We'l try who dare withstand us.<p>Well truckle no longer to Friend or to Foe,<br>But be ev'ry one's Friend that to us will be so;<br>Well build our Success wherever we go,<br>On the Justice of our Undertaking:<br>May evil betide them that evil do think;<br>Mean while (pray-thee Sawny) forget not to Drink,<br>Bon-voyage to Our FLEET, I'm resolved to skink,<br>One Brimmer or Two at our parting.<p>Now Malice and Envy are rampant with Rage,<br>To see Us so frankly our Purses engage,<br>Beyond Expectation; from which they presage,<br>In TRADE some strange Revolution:<br>Since by LAW to suppress us, none well dare move,<br>Gross Lyes and new Stories they dayly improve,<br>As hoping by such to make our Minds rove,<br>But well shew them a firm Resolution.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  <br> <br>Should our Neighbours still offer, instead of their Aid<br>To crush our Adventurers, (as it is said)<br>Or send us more Cox-combs in grave Masquerade<br>To sow and nourish Sedition:<br>May they never thereafter taste Pudding or Beef,<br>May Poverty seize their Traders in chief,<br>May they labour in Streights, and beg our Relief,<br>Till we pity at last their Condition.<p>And if any unnatural Son of a Scot,<br>Has basely against us engaged to Plot,<br>May he live in Disgrace, and at last may his Lot<br>Be to dance aloft in a Halter;<br>Let his Off-Spring beg both Abroad and at Home,<br>May the Curse of their Parent pronunce their Doome,<br>May they never be cherish'd wherever they come,<br>With either Food or Shelter.<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>May the Plague, and the Pox, and the Gravel, & Gout,<br>Seize them all over within and without,<br>May they never find Ease till their Candle go out,<br>Who labour to destroy us.<br>Let nothing disturb us, come let us go on,<br>And mind the Business which now were upon;<br>If JEHOVAH be for us, tho' but he alone,<br>Who is't that can annoy us?<p>Tho' Calumny, Malice, and Envy combine,<br>To strike at the Root of this noble Design,<br>Yet bravely to push it, well never decline,<br>in spite of all Banter or Bully: <br>Come the Work is near ended that well is begun,<br>Here's a Cup of Success to the RISING-SUN,<br>If any refuse it all over the Town,<br>May he soundly be kick'd for a Cully.<p>We'll Statues of Brass and Pyramides raise,<br>Well drink to the Health, and sing to the Praise,<br>Of our Nobles and Worthies, who made no delays<br>Our TRADE to free from Disaster:<br>Now that those who support it may scorn to relent,<br>That such as would crush it may'ye Cause to repent,<br>That Lyes may not fully what's honestly meant,<br>Is the Prayer of your Poet after.<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;FINIS.</p>
