	<h2>Transcription</h2>
	<p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;AN<p>E  L&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;E&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;G&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Y<p>On the Reverend&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Doctor  JOHN GlLLIES,  one of the Ministers<br>of Glasgow, who died in the 84 th year  of his  Age, and the<br>54th year-of his Ministry.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <p> The Reverend Doctor JOHN GILLIES was beyond all doubt an eminently pious man<br>beside which, he was a man of profound Erudition.' He was a most excellent Classical<br>Scholar, and uncommonly well skilled in the Oriental Languages, which circumstance ren-<br>dered him fully able to consult the Sacred Writings in their original purity unhurt by tranf-<br>lation, He composed many useful works ; among others he published '' an Hebrew Manual<br>for the use of Students of that Language.------" Historical Collections respesting the state<br>and progress of religion in various places and at different periods, in two volumes octavo.<br>"'Devotional Exercises on various passages of Scripture, In two volumes octavo.'-?A<br>complete version of the Psalms of David, adapted for families, in one volume, with. notes,<br>chiefly selected from Doctor Horne's excellent Commentary on the Psalms "?-?" Paradise<br>Lost, with notes from Scripture, in One volume, shewing that the principal beauties in that<br>inimitable Poem are borrowed from the Scripture, and quoting the verses of Scripture below<br>the text of the Poem, &c.''------That his labours in the Pulpit might be more. extensively use-<br>ful, He published weekly for a considerable time, a brief abstract or abridgement of  his Lec-<br>tures, in the size of a small pamphlet, and, to extend the sale, at the low price of one half-<br>penny per number, under the title of Exhortations to his Parishioners.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In  short,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Doctor,<br>Gillies was a man actuated by the strongest desire of Doing Good and promoting human happi<br>ness,?nor were his benevolent intentions warped by any narrow prejudices' of Partial Part<br>Spirit, (A SPIRIT FOREIGN TO THAT OF CHRIST.) His memory will long be he<br>in estimation as he was a venerable pattern of every Good Word and Work,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He died in perfe<br>peace at his house in Dunlop Street Glasgow, on Tuesday the 29th day of March 1796, in.<br>84th year of his age and 54th year of his Ministry.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He was ordained Minister of the Co<br>Kirk of Glasgow on the 29th day of July 1742.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  <p>THE Saint is gone--to all who knew him dear,<br>Who spent in usefulness his Period here,<br>From active virtue never did he cease,<br>But his whole Life was Piety and Peace:<br>In frame devout and constant pious mood,<br>He went about, for ever Doing Good.<p>In Church he Preach'd with unaffected grace,<br>His modest looks adorn'd the sacred place,<br>He taught no Doctrines New to fish for fame,<br>His good  old fashion'd truths were still the same,<br>Christ and him Crucified his constant theme.<p>while others frame Discourses stiff with art,<br>His honest aim was to amend the Heart,<br>More anxious for to prove a Sound Divine<br>Than with vain modern show of words to shine.<p>Resolv'd was he to use his Talents given,<br>To guide the wand'ring sinner towards Heaven,<br>And like a worthy Saint was ever glad,<br>To sooth the sorrows of the sick-man's bed,<br>with his most fervent prayers he joy'd to pour<br>The Balm of Comfort at the dying hour.<p>No partial narrow views debas'd his mind,<br>But to all Sects and Parties he was kind,<br>Like his great Lord who came from Heaven above,<br>whose first and chief commandment is to Love.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He preach'd repentance and reprov'd delay,<br> Allur'd to brighter worlds and led the way<br>To the blest regions  of Eternal Day<br> Then sure it will be deem'd presumption none<br>  To say, this venerable Saint is gone<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To sing HOSANNAHS round his Master s Throne !!!</p>
