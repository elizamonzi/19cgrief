	<p> King Crispin.<p><p>The ancient and modern history of King<br>Crispin, with a particular account of<br>the plan and order of the grand pro-<br>cession, time of meeting, &c.<p>Bannatyne's Key to the Al-<br>manack gives the following ac-<br>count of Sts Crispin and Cris-<br>pianus ."Saints Crispin and<br>Crispianus, brothers who tra.<br>veHed from Rome to Gaul to<br>preach, towards the end of the<br>third century ; and at their re-<br>sidence at Soissons, instructed<br>many in the Faith of Christ.<br>working in the night for their<br>support at their trade of shoe-<br>making. This they continued<br>several years, till an accusation<br>was lodged against them to the<br>Emperor Maximilan Herculeus,<br>who ordered them before Vas-<br>us, governor of that part of<br>Gaul, an inhuman judge, by<br>whose direction they suffered<br>the most cruel tortures, and fi-<br>nished their course by the<br>sword Hence Crispian was<br>sclected as the tutelar saint of<br>cordwainers, or coblers as they<br>were anciently termed:<p>A more modern legendery<br>Biography of these two person<br>ages is constituted among the<br>craft, the leading story of which<br>is as follows :?"The king of<br>Kent being engaged in was with<br>some of the  neigbouring  Kings,<br>was overthrown in the field of<br>battle, himself killed, and his<br>army entirely routed. The<br>Queen, for the safety pf the<br>two young princes, her sons,<br>Crispin and Crispianus, disguis-<br>ed them as peasants, for the<br>victor was making strict search<br>after them. "They travelled  a-<br>bout for some time, till at last<br>meeting with a shoemaker in or<br>about London, to whom,by<br>his frankness and civility to-<br>ward them, they told their<br>story, he took pity on then  and<br>invited to his house, and, the<br>better to conceal them, put<br>them to the stool, and behaved<br>to them in the most friendly<br>manner. It apppears that this<br>Shoemaker wrought to the<br>court, for Crispin had occasion<br>to be often in the presence of<br>the royal family. The King's<br>daughter, by his noble mein and<br>appearance, fell in love with<br>him, and they were privately<br>married by a blind priest. Be-<br>coming pregnant, it was agreed<br>that she would leave the palace.<br>Cripinanus, in order to further<p>her escape, set fire to one of<br>the signals near the cost This<br>was mistaken for the landing of<br>a foreign enemy, and the whole<br>place was put in confusion  at<br>this time Crispin liberated the<br>princess, and conducted her to<br>the Shoemaker's house. A<br>levy was then making to aug-<br>ment the army, and crispianus<br>was drawn, who sigialized him-<br>self so much by his martial<br>deeds that he was made knight,<br>and the king offered him any<br>thing he could wish, even to<br>the half of his kingdom,. and<br>the only favour he begged was<br>the pardon of his brother, which<br>the king, oh hearing their story,<br>granted. in a short time Cris-<br>pin ascended the throne, and<br>after doing all the good in his<br>power to his subject, retired<br>from an active to a pious  life,<br>on which account he was saint<br>ed and the shoemakers,through<br>gratitude for the privileges con-<br>ferred on them, made him their<br>tutelar saint."<p>0rder of  Procession,<p>Three Heralds.<br>Three Broads Sword men.<br>Six Spear Men-three and three<br>Champion Banner.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  <br>Champion 'Shield and  Spear.<br>Champion.<br>Sword of State.<br>Secretary of state,in his Robes<br>Six Gentleman Ushers.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; :<br>Three  Macers.<br>King, and Two supporters,<br>Nine Pages.<br>Nine Knights- three and three<br>Two Marshal Men. <br>Lord Mayor, and Two Aldermen.<br>Apprentices.<br>Four Knight?two and two<br>Band of Music<br>Chaplain.<br>P[  ]ces, and Two Supoorters.<br>Treasurer<br>Half of main Body.<br>Flags  <br>Half of Main Body.<br>Three Trumpeters&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  .<br>Indian&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prince,  and&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Supporters,<br>Riding.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>Page, Riding.<br>Marshal, and two knights <br>Two Ushers Black and Red Rod<br>Sir Hugh, and Two supporters<br>Treasurer, and Two  Supporters<br>Knights&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>Flags.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>Knights<br>Three Broad Sword Men<p>The Craft are to meet in the<br>Abbey, at 10 o'clock on Wed-<br>nesday Morning.<p>Printed for, and sold by R.
