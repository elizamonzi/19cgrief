	<p> Trial and Sentence.<p>A full and particular account of the Trial and Sentence of Rober<br>Emond, who is to be Executed at Edinburgh, on Wednesday the<br>17th of March, 1830, for the Barbarous Murder of Mrs Franks<br>and her Daughter, near Haddington, and whose body is to be<br>delivered to the Professor of Anatomy for Dissection.<p>Edinburgh, 8th February, 1830.?This day came on the trial of this criminal, whose<br>alleged crimes have excited so deep an interest throuchout this country. Shortly after nine<br>o'clock, the Court Room was nearly filled by advocates, writers to the signet, and the jury-<br>men. At a quarter from ten o'clock the prisoner was brought into the Court by two police-<br>officers, and looked very composed. His general appearance has certainly nothing in it to<br>indicare a ferocious character. The following indictment was then read?" Robert Emond,<br>grocer and draper, formerly residing in North Berwick, in the county of Haddington, pre-<br>sent prisoner in the jail of Edinburgh, you are indicted and accused, at the instance of Sir <p>William Rae of St. Catherine's, his Majesty's Advocate, that albeit,by  the laws of this and<p>every well governed realm, murder is a crime of an heinous nature, and severely punishable ,<br>yet true it is and of  verity that you, the said Robert Emond are guilty of the said crime,<br>actor or art and part, in so far as, on the night of the 25th day of October 1829, or on the<br>morning of the 26th day of the same month, or on one or other of the days of that month,<br>or of September immediately preceding, or of November immediately following, you, the<br>said Robert Emond, did within or near the house then or lately occupied by the now de-<br>ceased Katherin or Catherine Munro or Franks, widow of the deceased James Franks, or<br>by the said Catherine Munro or Franks, jeintly with her daughter Magdalene or Madeline<br>Franks, situated at or near the village of Abbey of Haddington, in the parish and county<br>of Haddington, violently, wickedly and feloniously attack and assault the said Catherine<br>Frank , and you did with a table knife or hatchet, or some lethal instrument to the prose-<p>head and face by which her skull was fractured in several different places, and she was<br>thereby severely and mortally weunded ; and immediately thereafter died from the in.<br>uries thus received, and was thereby murdered by you the said Robert Emond, and you<p>the said Magdeline Frank's person, and you did with a table knife, hatchet or some other<br>sharp and lethal instrument to the prosecutor unknown, inflict on her eight or thereby<br>severe blows or cuts on the head, by which her skull was fractured in several different<br>pieces, the upper part of the cranium broken in pieces, and she was instantly bereaved of<br>life, and thereby murdered by you the said Robert Emond "<p>Mr Riddell, sheriff-substitute of Haddington, and John Purves<br>clerk, proved the four declarations omitted by the prisoner. After<br>which Marion Inglis, near neighbour to the late Mrs Franks, de-<br>livered her evidence in a very clear and distinct mannre. She was<br>Mrs Franks and Madeline at half past 8 on Sunday evening before<br>they were found dead, they being in the habit of getting milk every<br>night from the witness, and they were both quite well then. John<br>Storrie and Alexander Dudgeon, millers, then described how Mrs<br>Franks and daughter's bodies were found on Wednesday, on their<br>going over the garden wall, to see if the pigs had meat. John<br>Lloyd, superintendant of police at Haddington, afterwards describes<br>what he saw, and took place, on his going to Mrs Franks' house on<br>the 28th October last, when he took Emond prisoner who asked in<br>a stammering way for what ? He told him that he was accused of<br>the murder of Mrs Frangs and her daughter ; when he said "Who<br>could say so." He then mentions the state in which he found stoc<br>kings, he had on at the time, which were wet and bloody.<p>Several other witnesses were then examined, among which was<br>Catherine Franks, daughter of the late Mrs Franks, only 11 years<br>old, who described the quarrel between Emond and his wife on the<br>Sunday, and his return home on Monday morning, all wet and<br>dirty. When he came in she was very frightened at him, he ap-<br>peared so wild and singular, though he said, " How are you all this<br>morning." Witness identified the shoes he had on then, and ex-<br>claimed, " There are the shoes he was brushing, and they were wet<br>at the time." The examination of James Paterson, teacher, North<br>Berwick, and his wife, followed, as did John Dunbar, barber, North<br>Berwick, Charles Ramage, constable, and Major-General Dalrymple,<br>who found in a room up stairs a coat, vest, trowsers, shirt, and also<br>a pair of stockings wet, and a pair of shoes with a pair of stockings<br>stuffed inside, which he identified in court.<p>Robert Tait, from Glasgow, another witness, stated, that Emond<br>slept in the same cell with him in the Calton jail, in November last,<br>and that on the Tuesday morning after Adams was tried, E?ond<br>said, he did not think a thief should suffer death ; adding, surely if<br>they were so severe with Adams, they would be much worse with<br>him, if the charge with which he was accused was made out. Wit-<br>ness said, " Did you really do it then ?" Emond replied, " Oh, yes,<br>but do not speak of it; the very thought of it goes to my heart like<br>a knife." D. A. Murray corroborated the last witness, after which<br>W. Morris and John Brown were examined in exculpation, when<br>the Lord Advocate shortly addressed the Jury, and claved a verdict<br>of Guilty. <p>His Lordship was followed by Mr M'Neil, for the pannel. After which the Lord Justice<br>Clerk summed up the evidence, and the Jury retired at ten minutes before 3 o'clock this<br>morning. In a hour they returned, when they unanimously found the pannel Guilty. He<br>was then sentenced to be executed at the head of Libberton Wynd, on Wednesday morning<br>the 17th March next and his body to be given for public dissection.<p>(Price One Penny.)<p></p>
