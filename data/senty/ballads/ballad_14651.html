	<p> DISCOVERY  OF A  MOST SHAMEFUL AND<p>INFAMOUS  DEN<p>IN  THE  NEW TOWN OF EDINBURGH.<p>This day is Published,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Full Particulars  of the<br>Proceedings&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;which  have been lately carried on in that<br>Infamous Den in  St David's Street,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Edinburgh ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;with<br>the examination of Mr and  Mrs Balfour, and 2 young<br>Ladies,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; belonging&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; that&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Splendid&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Establishment,<br>charged with decoying female children from the School,<br>and enticing from their Parents, for the vile intentions,<br>of certain beastly Noblemen and Gentlemen who are in<br>the habit  of frequenting that abominable  house.<p>It is seldom our painful duty to have to record a<br>case so degrading as the one we are about to present<br>to the public. Humiliating as the case certainly is,<br>the publishing of it way be the means of putting parents<br>and guardians of youth on the alert?of guarding against<br>the machinations of such vile seducers?and let those<br>beasts in the shape of gentlemen who encourage such<br>abominable practices know, that ways and means may<br>be used to stigmatize their name and blast their reput-<br>tion?The following is taken from the Scotsman.<p>ATROCIOUS CASE?A man and woman of the  name of Balfour<br>keepers of a brothel in  St David Street?a dashing courtizan?and a<br>young female were on Friday brought to the bar of the Police Court,<br>on a charge of entising a girl of 14 years of age into their house, and<br>with cetaining her against  her will,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;from the afternoon of Tuesday<br>till the forenoon of Wednesday last.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  It appeared from the evidence<br>that the younger prisoner (a girl  adout 15 years of age ) was gener-<br>ally employed&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;as a decoy  to  entice young females  into  this den of<br>infamy;  and  that,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;within&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a very short period, a&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;large number had<br>become her victims, one of whom, as well as the child on whose ac-<br>count this charge was brought forward, was examined as a witness.<br>The details given by this child are af the  most revolting and atrocious<br>it is possible to conceive.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  The children&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;were&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;first decoyed to the<br>house on a pretext of paying a visit, treated with great kindness, and<br>showy trinkets and dresses promised to them.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On a repetition of one<br>or two such visits they were generally detained?and, as swo rn to by<br>the little girl who was destined to be the last victim--forcibly detain-<br>ed- This child stated that she was decoyed from school, but un-<br>fortunately there were no witnesses  to corroborate her forcible de-<br>tention. The prisoners were accordingly dismissed, after a serious<br>admonition from Bailie Thomson, which along with the burst of<br>execration from the audiencs at their dismissal, is likely to ring in<br>their ears  till the day of their death.<p>ANOTHER ACCOUNT.<p>The Authorities for the&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;last&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;two or three days, have been engaged<br>in the investigation of a charge of a most brutal and revolting nature<br>brought  against&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a brothel&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;keeper,  and which&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;has excited&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a feeling<br>little short of  that&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;experienced at&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;detection of  Burke and his<br>associates  .&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A poor&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;little&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;girl aged 13, the daughter of a  respectable<br>tradesman, stated that she had been enticed&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;into  the&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;house  alluded<br>to, and kept in close confinement for&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;two days, when she was toreed<br>into the company of a BRUTE, who&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;behaved&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to her in a manner too<br>shocking to be related.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  A great many  witnesses, were examined, but<br>ulimately  the Magistrate dismissed the case for want of proof.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It<br>was also stated  that a  regular  practice&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of decoying&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;young  females<br>had been carried on&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;for some  time,  and the  names or nicknames of<br>several  gentlemen connected with this thriving establishment given.<br>We fearlessly tell  the Public Authorities,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;whose duty<br>It is to look  after such matters,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;not shrink from doing<br>their duty;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;that  the  description of some&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;individuals<br>caused of  promoting and&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;carrying&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;on the above  base,<br>and unmanly crimes bave been stated, and that neither<br>wealth nor station should b sufficient to shield them,<br>FORBES,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;PRINTER, EDINBURGH. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br></p>
