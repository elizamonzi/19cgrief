	<p> STRUGGLE FOR THE<br>BREECHES.<p><br>He, About my wife I mean to sing a very funny song,<br>She&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope that yon will tell the truth let it be right or wrong,<br>He&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You know you are an arrant scold, both out of doors and in,<br>She&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I  knew you brute it was a he before you did begin.<p>CHORUS.<p>He so  you are inclined I still do find, the breeches for to wear,<br>She  No dear not I, but I will die, or I will have my share.<br>h. Every morning I must rise before the day does break,<br>s. Unto the door I do suppose, your water for to make,<br>h.  No it is to light the fire and have the breakfast by,<br>s. You have such a craving appetite, in bed you cannot lie.<br>h. Don't contradict  me, ron jade nor let my passion rise,<br>s. You stupid sot, I heed you not, because you are not wise,<br>h. I tell you to hold your tongue, your temper I cannot bear,<p>s.  You ass if I should hold my tongue my fingers I'd besmear.<br>h.  You promis'd when I married you that you would me obey.<br>s. You promis'd for to cherish me, but then you went astray,<p>h.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Woman's made of crook'd mind and was formed in six days,<br>s.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes they are made of pure stuff, but men are filth and clay.<br>h. Keep silent now, or I will tell your faults so all around.<br>s. You silly man do all you can, for I will stand my ground,<br>h. King Soloman said, virtuous wives he could but find a few,<br>s.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It's lie to say that he was wise, he was a fool like you.<br>h. Since you provoke me now so  far I'll let the truth be known,<br>s. I know full well my faults you'll tell, but first tell your own,<p>h.  It's neither in nor out of bed, I've any peace with you,<p>s.  you silly fool don't talk of bed. it's  little there you do,<p>h.  Then in a public-house  you go and there you do sit down,<br>s.  You sot where I spend four-pence, you spend more than a crow<br>h. The young ones I have got to nurse, and took  the cradle too,<p>s. For fear you should do something worse I leave you that  to do<p> s.That's true but I might show you some droller looking  place,<br>h. And when we down to dinner sit. there you grunt and  groan,<p>s.  That is because you eat the beef, and leave me nought but bone<p>h.  You know I 've acted like a man since me and you was joined,<br>s. Thedevil a bit of manhood ever in you did I find.<p>h. It in anything I acted wrong  explain it to me now,<p>s. There's many a man that harrows, what another man does so<p>h. And when tea time It does come on , then you must take the pot<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;s. I look for a strong cup of tea, but no such thing I got,<br>h.And  when tha we do go  to bed, you can't agreeable be.<br>s. Because you can't act like a man but turn your back  to me.<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;h. my father was a wealthy Lord, had houses  plo ughs and carts,<br>s. Yes feathered fowl have wings of gold, we hear  in foreign parts<br>h. my mother was a lady gay, you know it to be true,<br>s. I wish that she had broke your back and made a lord of you.</p>
