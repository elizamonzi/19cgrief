	<p> Wonderful Prophecies of JOHN LECKIE,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<p>Who died on the 6th August, 1820, at Cramond, at the age of 105,<br>with an account of the Wonderful Changes that would take place<br>in the year 1822, in England, Ireland, and especially in Scotland.<p><br>At the conclusion of a long life, and which to the young reader, may appear a great<br>blessing, as it falls to the lot of few ; yet, to me, whose sand-glass is nearly run, it appears<br>but as a tale, and as a vision of the night. In the course of my journeyings through the<br>wilderness of time what scenes have I witnessed, what prosperity have I enjoyed, what re-<br>verses of fortune have I suffered; I have had friends who enjoyed with me all the blessings<br>which a kind Providence could bestow; acquaintances with whom I spent the giddy hour,<br>and whose conversation gilded the morning of life; youths, who were my school-fellows,<br>and whose happiness was my own, and who accompanied me in almost all the walks of life.<br>But more mature thoughts hang heavy on my heart, and I begin to ask where are they now ?<br>No one answers, and I am obliged to solve the question myself. Those with whom I lived;<br>those who reared me up from infancy to manhood; those who sported with me in all the<br>playfulness of youth, are gone! have shut their eyes for ever on all beneath the sun, and I<br>am left alone, a burden to myself, a burden to strangers, and a burden to society, with-<br>out one earthly ray of hope to shine upon the evening of my days. But there is one hope,<br>of which no one can deprive me, (even in this second state of childhood), the hope of a<br>more blessed and lasting state, which can support beggars, as well as kings, at the solemn hour<br>of death.<p>The revolution of seasons ; the rise and fall of Kings ; the prosperity and adversity of<br>Empires ; the feuds of party, and the ravages of war, which have been carried on, with<br>little intermission, in almost every country in the habitable globe, from my earliest years,<br>all these have I witnessed, and have no more than outlived them.<p>I here paused and went to bed, and in the midst of my Contemplation, I was weighing<br>in my own mind, who was the cause of all these wars, of all these party broils, and the nu-<br>merous evils which embitter the lot of man, when I had recourse to my Bible, where I<br>found all these things as plainly told, as if they had taken place at the time when the writ-<br>ers were penning them. I now closed my eyes for sleep, when lo ! a vision appeared and<br>addressed me thus:?Far greater things than  those you have been Contemplating will take<br>place in the year 1822; England, after having lavished her millions upon surrounding na-<br>tions, will herself be forced, to seek relief, and no power will be found hospitable enough<br>to satisfy her request; her manufactures shall fail, there being no demand for them, and<br>the seat of commerce shall be removed beyond the Atlantic sea; divisions will take place<br>in the Councils of the Nation, us to the best mode of saving it from bankruptcy  , and a bill<br>will be passed to abolish all credit; after this, a new system of things will take place, and<br>England will again shine forth in all the splendour of noon-day.<p>Ireland, long the seat of disaffection, shall be relived  from its present distresses, and be<br>enabled, by the cultivation of its soil, to maintain its own  peasantry, without being obliged<br>to allow her sons to emigrate to other countries to take the employment  from those who<br>have not enough for themselves, and eat the bread of others which their own country is so<br>amply fitted to produce; her long-sought-for claims will be restored, and her sons enjoy<br>all the privileges which Protestants at present receive; she will not be allowed to merge<br>back into her former superstitions, but will be brought under the glorious Dispensation<br>which is so near at hand, when all sects shall be united in one great body.<p>Scotland, the cradle of industry, whose mechanics can-challenge Europe for their equal ;<br>whose scholars can match the once-fam'd Greeks, and whose orators can compete with the<br>once eloquent sons of Rome, thou must also undergo a change ; darkness must hover round<br>thee for a season ; thy sons shall be driven from their present employ, and be obliged to<br>work for a scanty pittance, at labour which they are unaccustomed to ; thy women and<br>children shall be clothed in humble attire, and their food shall be but small; they shall cry,<br>but there shall be none to pity, and society shall be, in some degree, dissolved. All this<br>shall come upon thee for thy abuse of former mercies ; for thy numerous transgressions<br>shalt thou meet this punishment. But this shall continue only for a short time, and thou<br>shalt come out of these afflictions, and be again reinstated in thy former greatness, and<br>be a pattern to the surrounding nations. The vision immediately fled, and a cold sweat<br>covered my emaciated body while it was speaking. This may appear wonderful, now that<br>prophets have ceased, and may be considered by the learned as a fit of delirium or a dream,<br>or some ventriloquist displaying his magic powers; but the reader may rely that neither of<br>these circumstances deceived me, as these events will take place in your own day, and in<br>your own experience.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Glasgow, printed by W. Carse.</p>
