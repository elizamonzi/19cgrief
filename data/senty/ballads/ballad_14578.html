	<h2>Transcription</h2>
	<p> Second Edition.<p>An Account of the Behaviour, Confession and Execu-<br>tion of John . Howison, who was executed at Edin-<br>burgh, this morning, Saturday, the 21st January,<br>1832, for the Inhuman Murder of an old Woman,<br>in her own house, at Cramond.<p>EDINBURGH, 21st January, 1832.?It will be recollected, that<br>this unhappy man, almost at the very moment that other<br>two unfortunate men, Gow and Beveridge, were suffering the last <br>penalty of the law, in this city, for a similar crime, committed mur-<br>der, in a very brutal and barbarous manner, on the person of a very<br>innocent and industrious old woman, at Cramond, with in five<br>miles of Edinburgh, by cutting her face, with a garden spade,<br>down and across her face, which laid it fully open, in a shocking<br>manner, even in broad day-light. He was brought in the next day,<br>the 3d of December last, after considerable resistance on his parr,<br>on a cart, tied;  and, after several examinations before the Sheriff,<br>was fully committed for trial.<p>He was accordingly tried, before the High Court of Justiciary,<br>on the last day of the year, Saturday, 3lst December, 1831, and,<br>after an interesting and impartial trial, which lasted from ten on<br>Saturday morning, till after three on Sabbath morning, was unani-<br>mously found Guilty of Murder as libelled. A plea of insanity<br>was urged in defence, but which was rejected on the medical evi-<br>- dence, as well as on other evidence. Therefore, after a serious ad-<br>monition, and a most feeling exhortation, from the presiding Judge.<br>the Lord Justice Clerk, Boyle, sentenced to be executed at Edin-<br>burgh, on Saturday the 21st January, 1832, and his body to be<br>given to Dr Munro, of the University, for dissection.<p>Several persons obtained permission to visit him since his con-<br>demnation, in order to satisfy themselves as to his sanity ; of course,<br>there were various opinions formed. The most prevalent opinion,<br>however, by all those who had the best opportunities of forming<br>any, correctly, was, that the more was seen of him, the more he<br>seemed to be perfectly sane ; and he even spurned the very idea of<br>his being, in any manner whatever, considered insane. He posi-<br>tively denied having committed the crime for which he was about<br>to suffer, saying?" That no person ever saw him do it." He was<br>a great gormandiser when he could get it, and considered good<br>living every thing to be wished for He condsidered himself to be<br>particularly attached to the Society of Christian Friends, commonly<br>called Quakers, though it is well known he never was admitted a<br>member of that respectable association.<p>At a quarter past three yesterday afternoon, he was brought over<br>from the Calton Jail to the Lock-up house. After being a short<br>time there, he went to bed, and slept soundly for a considerable<br>time. He arose this morning, and appeared in the same indiffe-<br>rent state as before, strengthening the belief, formerly strongly sus-<br>pected, that more murders lay as heavy at his heart as that for <br>which he was just about to suffer. About eight, Bailies Haig and<br>Aitchison, attended with the proper officers, appeared at the Lock-<br>up, when the culprit was brought into the hall, attended by the<br>Rev. Mr Bruce, and the Rev. Mr Porteous, who were with him for<br>some time previous; and, indeed, who were indefatigable in their<br>endeavours to bring him to a proper sense of his awful situation<br>since his condemnation. After a psalm was sung and prayers of-<br>fered up, the procession moved slowly up the wynd to the scaffold.<p>He appeared on the scaffold shortly after eight, where he remain-<br>ed but for a short time, and while a most devout prayer was offered<br>for him to the Throne of Grace for mercy. All things being pre-<br>pared, he mounted the fatal drop ; and, after a few minutes, he re-<br>luctantly dropped the signal, and was instantly launched into eter-<br>nity. He was about 44 years of age, of very loathsome and un-<br>couth appearance. After hanging the usual time, the body was<br>cut down, and sent to the College for dissection.<p>His Confession will soon appear at full length, in which he ac-<br>knowledged having murdered a Jew, four boys and one girl be-<br>sides a boy who he attempted to murder, but who was preserved,<br>making eight, including Mrs Geddes.<p></p>
