	<p> LIVES & TRANSACTIONS<p>OF THE GILMERTON<p>MURDERerS,<p><br>DOBIE AND THOMSON.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  <p>Full, True, and Particular Account of the Lives and Transactions of<br>David Dobie and John Thomson, the Gilmerton Murderers, toge-<br>ther with a very full and most correct account of their conduct and<br>declarations in the Lock-up-house, on the night before the Execu-<br>catioin, and on their last moments on the Scaffold, all extracted from<br>the Coura nt Newspaper,<p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lives and Transactious of David Dobie and<p>John Thomson<p>John Thomson Thomson was twenty one years of<br>age, and was a tall slender man, with a face<br>of little meaning ; he lost his father when he<br>was two years old, but was sent some years to<br>school, where he learned to read and write,<br>and to repeat  the Shorter Catechism of the<br>Church of Scotland, with the Scripture proofs,<br>this useful mannal had made little lmpression<br>on his mind, as he had long forgotten it.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At<br>a Sunday evening school, for religious instruc-<br>tion, he had been exercised in other tasks, but<br>apparently with little effect ; both he and his<br>campanion seem to have thought, that their<br>attendance at this school was a sufficient apol-<br>ogy for absence from public worship, and they<br>considered the exhortations, which they heard<br>there, as an equivalent to preaching.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thom-<br>son at the age at twelve years, began to drive<br>a cart with yellow sand, an  article which, is<br>sold every morning in- the streets of  Edin<br>burgh, and he after wards became the  driver<br>of a cart with coals, which he was in the ha-<br>bit of retailing in small quantities among poor<br>people, who were unable to buy more than<br>hundred weight or two at a time.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While he<br>led this life, his chief companions were young<br>men of the same occupation, and for  some<br>years past he has associated more. with David <br>Dobie  than with any other  person,  and has<br>been much addicted to  drinking. According<br>to his own statement, he  was always simple<br>and easily  led, and scarcely  ever had a good<br>advice from any person, with the exception of<br>his&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;mother.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On the fatal Saturday evening<br>when the crime was commited, he had been<br>drinking more than usual, and they would not<br>have seen the woman who&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;lost her life, if<br>Dobie  would have passed the public house<br>where she came up to them&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;had been<br>drinking much too.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;particulars of the <br>abominable atrocities, perpetrated in the dead<br>of night, he has never detailed, and though he <br>has&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;sometimes&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;said&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;that  nobody&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;knew so<br>much of the transaction as himself, he has oc-<br>casionally hinted that the injuries might as<br>well have been inflicted by other hands than<br>either his or Dobie's.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He sometimes said that<br>Dobie was answerable only for the robbery ;<br>at, other&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;times he  said that this was not the<br>only&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;act of which&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dobie&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;was  guilty: bat<br>though he wag aware  that Dubie had offered<br>to become King's eviderice, he generally said&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>that it was hard to take a man's life for  all<br>that cable had done.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Expressions sometimes<br>dropped from him, from which it might have<br>been inferred that he had bouad himself not&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>to  reveal what he knew of Dobie's guilt<br>but his general remark was.  that it could do&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;no good now, and that the declarations said to&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>have been made by the woman were in some.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>respects not true, and could not be correct, as&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>she was so very drunk as to be  incapable of&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>remembering any thing.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He  has never de-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>nied his own guilt, and he is said to have been&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>employed,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;almost&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;without intermission, in&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>reading. the Scriptures and atherserious books,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>and in praying and singing psaims.<p>David Dobie was 26 years of age, and had&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>a look of much greater acuteness than Thom- <br>son.  When he was vary young his father had  <br>his arm shattered by the upsetting of his cart,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>necessary to be unfit for labour,  and  it was thus&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>necessary that his numerous children should&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>sooner work for their bread than they would&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>other wise have done.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; David, after he learned  <br>to read and.  write tolerably,  at the age  of&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>right assisted his elder brother, who drove a&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>cart with yellow sand.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a few "years after-<br>wards be began to drive to drive coals, and he had  no&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>oppertunity of making farther progress in&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>education accept at an evening school occa-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>sonally&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the subject of the crime for&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<p>which, he suffered, he had early given a state<br>ment, to which, however,  little credit can be<br>  given.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He said he knew little more than that<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  Thomson had given him a tin box. which box<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thomson, on the other hand, denied that he<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; had. ever given him.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Two or three days after<p>the crime was committed, Dobie gave this box<br>to another man. stating that he had found  it,<br>About the same  time he spoke with  brutal<br>levity" to some of his companions of the vio-<br>lence which Thomson had committed.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; How<br>far he was personally concerned in  this vio<br>lence can never be known,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  As he was home<br>and in bed nearly an  hour  before , Thomson, <br>he had prabably no hand in some of the incre-<br>dible outrange of of which the&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;wretched&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;female.<br>was the victim,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We purposely abstain from<br>the recital. of a variety of particulars with  re-<br>gard to Dobie  which it would be unprofitable<br>to detail.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; His wife and children are objects,<br>of deep commiseration, and his parents, bro-<br>hers, and sisters, are not less to&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <p>Dobie was a man of a frank and forward <br>disposition, and, though fearless of offending<br>the feelings of others, he was often ready to ,<br>perform obliging and neighbourly officers<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; EXECUTION<p>Yesterday  morning  thase&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;two  criminals&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <p>suffered last punishment of the law, at the&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <p>usual  place of execution,  for the atrocious&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <p> murder and  robbery of  Margaret&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Paterson,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  <p>committed on the road to Gilmerton in April&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  <p>last.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thomson received the final visit from&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  <p>his relations on  Friday last,  and the  scene&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  <p>which took place was highly affecting.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tues&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<p>day night Dobie was&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Visited&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;by his  brother&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  <p>and a friend.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The criminals were taken from&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  <p>the jail to the Lock-up house in a carriage on&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  <p>Tuesday afternoon,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;About midnight they lay&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <p>down, but did not sleep.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Before lying down&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  <p>Dobie wrote to his wife and  other&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;relations&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  <p>in which he exhorted&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;them to turn from the&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <p>evil of their ways, and seek for mercy through&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  <p>the merits of a redeemer&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<p>Thomson also wrote to his mother; his let-<p>ter was very laconic.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  It merely  stated that&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  <p>he entertained hopes. of pardon  through  the&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  <p>merits of Jesus Christ, and bade her farewell,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  <p>In the course of the night Thomson&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;washed&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  <p>his feet and legs, as he said that he might be&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <p>more&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;confortable;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;his  real  object  was&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  <p>different, and his companion seemed to under&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>stand it, for he said,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Never wind  Jock, we<p>will be well enough&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;scrapit  i'  the  College.'&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <p>This coarse expression is perhaps as good  an&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  <p>illustration of&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dobie's  character as can  be&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <p>given.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  <p>Shortly before six o'clock., the reverend  Dr<br>Lee am! Mr Porteous' were in attendance upon<p>the criminals.?-They both&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;exhibited  the ut&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<p>mast firmness and resignation,  acknowledged&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  <p>the many sins of which they had been guilty,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  <p>and&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;expressed&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a sincere&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;hop'e  of salvation&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  <p>through the blood of Christ. After prayer and&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  <p>singing a hymn a basin of  tea was given to <p>each:and at a quarter past Seven, they cams&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  <p>down stairs  and had their arms pinioned. on&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  <p>entering the apartment where the executioner&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  <p>was, Dobie looked&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;wildly  around, appeared&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  <p>much agita ed and immediately exclaimed ' I<p>thought we were going  up,' (meaning- to the&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  <p>scaffold)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To Thomson&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;he said,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;' I hope the&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  <p>Lord will  have  mercy  upon us  to which&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  <p>Thomson,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;in rather an absent&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;manner, re-<p>sponded  I hope so?-Thomson was through&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>but remarkably composed ; he appeared indif, <p>serent to all worldly matters, and never utter&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<p>ed a word, exceut in to questions asked;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  <p>and these to generally answered by ' yes' or&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <p>no ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;except in one  instance, when he said,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  <p>I am as composed now as ever I was in my&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  <br>life.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  Dobie on the contrary&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;was unusually&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  <br>restless and distured He inquired the hour.<p><p>and wished to ascertain how long they would<br>remain in the house. When the executioner<br>commenced pinioning them, each seemed<br>much interested in the fate of his companion ;<p>but they did not speak.<p>On entering the apartment where Dr Lee<br>and Mr Porteous: were, Dobie. in reply to a<br>question as to how he felt, The Lord,<p>I hope, has given me strength,'&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When asked,<br>it they Wished any particular Psalm, Hymn, or<br>Paraphrase, Dobie answered that he wished<br>the Hymn beginning, 'The hour of my depar-<br>ture's come.'&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It being mentioned that they<br>had just sang that Hymn up stairs, he said,<br>Well, any one you like best will do as welll<br>-sing the 51st Psalm,' This was accordingly<br>done, commencing with the words,  All mine<br>iniquities blot out ;' and both joined in sing-<br>ing,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Porteous then prayed earnestly, the<br>criminals kneeling,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It was during this scene<br>that their feelings and  state of mind were <br>most&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;strongly marked.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  Thomson threw,<br>him self on his knees-covered his face with<br>his hands, and continued apparently anxiously'<br>responding to  the  petition  put up  in  his<br>behalf&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;bat not a sound  escaped  his  lips.<br>Dobie's conduct forced, on the Other hand, a&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>complete contrast to the coolness, but not in-<br>difference, of Thomson. At some parts of the<br>prayer, particularly those wherein their state&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>is fallen men-the situation of the village to<br>which they belonged, as being very wicked,<br>and the helpless condition of Dobie's widow<br>and children, were alluded to, occasionally a<br>deep groan involuntarily escaped him, or the<br>exclamation of ' Oh ay-eh, yes." Before the<br>prayer was concluded, he rose on one knee,<br>turaed half round,  and convulsively grasped<p>psalm book which he held between his<br>hands ; in fact, every movement of his body<br>and expression of his countenance conveyed,<p>language too striking to be misunderstood,<br>the impression that his mind was ill at ease?<br>that hit whole soul was awfully troubled.<br>They were then advised to pray by them-<br>selves, and both complied. Dobie prayed<br>load, calling for ' Help in this his day of<br>trouble;' ' that the Lord would not hide his<br>face from him, but be merciful, for he was a<br>great sinner ,' and similar emphatic Scriptural<br>expressions ?Thomson was not heard to pray.<br>On rising they. both thanked the reverend<br>gentlemen for their, attention ; and Dobie said,<br>I hope our fate ,will be a warning to that<br>wicked place to which we belong !' To the<br>Governor of the Jail. Mr Rose, he said, ' will<br>you look after my poor wife and children ?'<br>and an answer in the affermative seemed. to<br>give him great relief.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<p>On the Magistrates being announced, they<br>rose, and declared themselves ready, and al-<br>most immediately thereafter proceeded to the<br>scaftold?Thomson being assisted by Mr Per-<br>teoas and Thomson by Dr Lee.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When they<br>ached Libberton's Wynd, a sort of buzzing<br>noise was heard from the crowd in the Lawn-<br>market l; this, scemed to affect  Dobie much,<br>and or Black procured him a glass of water,<br>which he drank eagerly.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(When on the drop<br>he again called for water,  which was given&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>him)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On the platform, a portion of the 40  h<br>Psalm was sung, and Dr  Lee prayed&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The<br>criminals then took their places on the drop-<br>the ropes were adjusted, and they prayed for<br>some minutes.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In answer to a question put&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  <p>to Thomson, He said that his sentence was just<br>and proper ; and Dobie at the same time said<br>I do not deny my guilt.'&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  Having bidden<br>farewell to those around them,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dobie asked<br>Thomson if he was ready, to which  question<br>the latter instantly  replied,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;' I am  ready,'&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>and the former giving the signal, the drop self-.<br>Thomson struggled more than his companion,<br>but a either appeared to suffer long.</p>
