	<p> ALLEN AND SALLY.<p>John Harkness, Printer, Church St., Preston.<p>'Twas in the evening of a wintry day,<br>Then just returning from a long campaign,<br>Allen, o'er tired and weary with the way,<br>Came home to see his Sally once again.<p>His tatter'd arms he carelessly threw down,<br>And view'd his Sally with enraptured eyes;<br>But she rece ved him with a modest frown,<br>She knew not Allen in his rough disguise.<p>His hair was knotted and his beard unshorn,<br>His tatter'd 'couterments about him hung;<br>A tear of pleasure did his cheeks adorn,<br>And blessings fell in torrents from his tongue.<p>Am I so alter'd by war's cruel trade,<br>That you your faithful Allen have forgot;<br>Or has your heart upon some other stray'd ?<br>Ah ! why escaped I from the murdering shot ?<p>When thus he spoke, her wonted colour fled,<br>She ran and sunk upon her Allen's breast,<br>All pale awhile she looks like one that's dead,<br>He kiss'd, she breath'd,  and all her love  con-<br>fess'd.<p>Yes, my delight, tho' alter'd as thou art,<br>Reduced by war's horrid carnage to this state,<br>Thou art the golden treasure of my heart,<br>My long lost husband, & my wish'd-for mate.<p>BANKS<p>OF<p>CLYDE.<p>John Harkness, Printer, Preston.<p>When I was young and youth did bloom,<br>Where fancy led me I did rove,<br>From town to town, the country round,<br>Through every every sylvan shady grove.<br>Until I came to Scotland by name,<br>Where beauty shines on every side !<br>There's no town there we can compare,<br>With Glasgow fair on the banks of the Clyde.<p>As I went out in the evening clear,<br>By the banks of Clyde I chanc'd to gang ;<br>There I met a weel-fair'd lass,<br>Her beauty put me to a stand :<br>Her cherry cheeks and ruby lips,<br>Her hair in ringlets down did glide,<br>And I fain would have kiss'd her balmy lips,<br>As she walk'd along the banks of Clyde.<p>I spier'd at her, and said, fair maid,<br>How far this road do you mean to gang,<br>A mile or two, kind sir, she said, <br>Towards a town called Ruthersglen ;<br>Will you take company, my pretty made,<br>With one who'd have you for his bride,<br>So arm in arm, without fear or harm,<br>They walked along on the banks of Clyde.<p>I'm afraid you are from Ireland,<br>From Belfast just now come o'er,<br>A sea-port town of great renown,<br>Towards the north-eastern shore ;<br>That you have left some beauty bright,<br>Who is well known to be your bride,<br>Therefore, said she, 'tis dangerous for me,<br>To walk with you on the banks of Clyde.<p>I said no more, but I went with her,<br>The waters they were running clear,<br>The small birds gone into their nests,<br>The moon in glances did appear ;<br>I put my arms about her waist,<br>Her fears began now to subside,<br>And oft I kiss'd her ruby lips,<br>As she lay in my arms on the banks of Clyde.<p>But what we did, or what we said,<br>There's no one breathing here shall know ;<br>Oft times I kiss'd her ruby lips,<br>While her colour oft did come and go ;<br>Sir, since you've got your will, she says,<br>I pray make me your lawful bride ;<br>I promis'd to meet here there again,<br>But I forgot, and cross'd the Clyde.<p>377</p>
