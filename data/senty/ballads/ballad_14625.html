	<p> Awful Crime!<p><p>A full and particular account of the Trial and Sen-<br>tence of JAMES NEWLANDS, who is to be executed<br>at Inverness, on Saturday the 25th May, 1833, for<br>the Horrible crime of Rape on a young girl, only<br>17 years of age.<p>At Inverness, on Thursday the 2d May 1833, James Newlands,<br>from Speymouth, Morayshire, was put to the bar, charged with<br>having voilated the person of a young woman named Jane Ross,,<br>servant to John Inglis, farmeo at Westerton. The prisoner pleaded<br>not guilty. This case was, as usual, tried with closed doors. The<br>unfortunate woman is only 17 years of age. It appears the prisoner<br>had in company with Jane Ross, and several other young persons,<br>been returning from Elgin Feeing Market; they stopt at a public<br>house at Lanbride, and had a glass or two of spirits. Newlands<br>(who is about 39 years of age, and unmarried) then advised Jane<br>Ross to walk on before with him, and take a different road from<br>the rest of the party, stating that they would speedily rejoin them<br>at a place where the two roads met. He had no intention of re-<br>joining the company, but violated the person of the poor girl, and<br>brutally attacked her three different times. On reaching her mas-<br>ter's house, she informed her mistrces of the ill treatment she had<br>experienced, and next morning she acquainted her relations with<br>the fact. The case was fully established by the evidence of the<br>young woman and other witnesses. It engaged the Court from<br>about three o'clock to half-past two on the Sabbath morning. The<br>jury returned a verdict of guilty of ths crime libelled, but from the<br>previous good character of the prisoner, unanimously recommend-<br>ed him to mercy.<p>Monday, April 29th.? At nine o'clock this morning the Court as-<br>sembled. Jemes Newlands was placed at the bar, and Lord Med-<br>wyn addressed his brother judge, Lord Moncrieff, at some length, on<br>the henious nature of the crime of which the jury had fouud the<br>pannel guilty, after a painful and patient investigation, He- felt it<br>to be his duty to propose, in the aggravated circumstances of the<br>case, nothing less than the punishment of death. His lordship there-<br>fore proposed that the prisoner at the bar be executed on the 25th<br>of May.<p>Lord Moncrieff put on the black coif, and the prisoner having<br>stood up, proceeded in a most impressive manner to deliver the<br>sentence proposed by Lord Medwyn. His Lordship referred to<br>some of the leading circumstances of the case, exhibiting the malig-<br>nity of his intentions, and the cruelty of his purposes. From your<br>years and other circumstances, you was calculated to be the pro-<br>tector rather than the destroyer of the young woman, whom you<br>have so deeply and irreparably injured. After she had cast herself<br>upon your confidence and protection you have planted in her heart<br>a wound which she herself has declared was more painful to her<br>than death itself. When our Creator presented to man in his lone-<br>ly and unfallen state, woman, to be a comfort and a blessing, he<br>did not give her for the gratification of passions, degrading in them-<br>selves, or like that of the brutes that perish, but for the perpetuation<br>and preservation of our own species. The God of Nature has im-<br>planted in the constitution of women, principles and feelings which<br>are calculated to exalt and improve our condition, and has given to<br>our sex, affections and privileges, which woman, in her proper place,<br>can well esteem and repay. But for you, unfortnnat man, you have<br>violated the laws of God and nature, and with a determination and<br>resklessness degrading to our sex, for the gratification of your sel-<br>fish passions, turned a blessing into a bitter curse. Your days are<br>now numbered, and it becomes you to apply to that fountain of<br>mercy, which is able to make you acceptable to God ; and one of<br>the first visible evidences of your repentance will be, to banish from<br>your mind all feelings of resentment towards that young woman,<br>whose happiness you have destroyed, and by every means which<br>the law permits, and you have in your power, to endeavour to re-<br>store to her, that character which, in the course of your defence,<br>you have attempted to deprive her of, by throwing out insinuations<br>as to her purity. I would not advise you, said his Lordship, em-<br>phatically, to build much hope on the recommendation to mercy,<br>to which I have referred, but would recommend you to prepare<br>your mind to meet that God before whom you must so speedily ap-<br>pear. May the God of peace, that brought again from the dead<br>that everlasting covenant, grant you the salvation of which you stand<br>so much in need. His Lordship then read the sentence of the Court.<p>The prisoner seemed little affected during the delivery of this sol-<br>emn adress, and at the conclusion, when about to be removed, turned<br>round as if he had forgot something, and exclaimed in a moderately<br>firm voice?" I declare before God and man, and this Court, that I<br>am innocent."&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<p>EDINBURGH:?Printed for Francis M'Cartney ..&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
