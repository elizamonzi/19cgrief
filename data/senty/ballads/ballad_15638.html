	<p> A<br>Faithful NARRATIVE,<p>OF<p>The Cifcumstances of the Cruelty<br>committed upon the Body  of john<br>Halden in the Abbay of Holy-Rood-<br>House, on Tuesday the 7th of April<br>Instant, who died next Day.<p>THE Subject of this melancholly Narrative, raging in different Cor-<br>ners of the Kingdom, with ad unparallel'd Violence as our Courants<br>inform us, and making near Approaches to our Capital City, 'tis<br>the Duty of ev'ry honest Man to expose the Actors, and give an ingenious<br>Account of Facts.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; May this Rehearsal quicken Christians to Repentance<br>and induce us to lay seriously to Heart our horrid Provocations, which tempts<br>God to give up so many Persons to the Conduct of Satan and their own Lusts,<br>and allows them to kill their fellow Creatures, and. render themselves in-<br>sensible of the Terrors of the Almighty.<p>On Saturday last John Halden a Boy of 13 Years, Son of Umquhile Ro-<br>bert Halden Soldier in the Scots-Guards, left his Mother, an Indigent Wi-<br>dow in the Town of Hamilton in the County of Clidsdale, to supplicate <br>Charity, till Providence provided him Service ; and coming to Edinburgh,<br>beg'd Alms at the Door of his Grace the Duke of Hamilton's Kitchen in the<br>Palace of Holy-Rood-House, where he met with rough and threatning Lan-<br>guage from Thomas Swinton the Butler : But the Cravings of an hungry<br>Paunch,obliging the distressed Innocent young Man to repeat his Complaints,<br>hoping to melt the. surly Man into Compassion, who's diabolick<br>Passion, had so far the Ascendant of Reason and Charity, that he threw the<br>miserable Mendicant (weak thro' Want of these Comforts of Life, which<br>render'd the other fatally strong ) with a Violence manag'd by infernal<br>Strength from the Posts of the Door, and his Head dash'd on a large Pillar<br>of Stone, one of the Supports of the Royal Fabrick. The Earl of Ruther-<br>glen's Coach-man with horror, beholding the nefarious Action, rais'd tho<br>Boy's Body, and according to Skill administer'd Relief, and caus'd carry<br>him to his Quarters at the Foot of the Canongate, where he groan'd his<br>Ailments till Wednesday at 4 Afternoon, when he breath'd his last ; And<br>Charity obliges us to. believe, went to our Father's House, where Misery<br>is a Motive for Mercy, and there is Bread enough and to spare. <p>The Surgeons who gave their charitable Attendance during his Malady,<br>saw'd his Head when remov'd ; who report, that the Skull and Interiors<br>were intire, so that they could not assert his Death was the effect of<br>Srpinton's Usage, nor shall I, till either his Conserence declare it, or the<br>penetrating Providence of GOD reveal it.</p>
