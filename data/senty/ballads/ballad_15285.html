	<h2>Transcription</h2>
	<p> An Account of Christian Sinclair, Executed at Edinburgh on Wednesday<br>last, for Murder, with her Behaviour at the Place of Execution.<p>THIS unfortunate old woman was found Guil-<br>ty of the Horrid and Cruel Murder of her<br>Brother's illegitimate infant daughter, by a respect-<br>able Jury, on Monday the  22nd day of November<br>last, before the High Court or Justiciary, at Edin-<br>burgh, and Sentenced to be executed at the west<br>end of the Tolbooth of that City, and her body,<br>after hanging the usual time to be deilvered to the<br>Professor of Anatomy of the university to be pub-<br>licly dissected. The circumstances, as proved on the<br>trial were, That Jean petrie, residing in kirkwall,<br>parish of St Ola, and country of Orkney, was diliver-<br>ed of a female child in august 1812, and said that<br>thomas Sinclair, also residing there, a married man,<br>and brother to Christian Sinclair, the prisoner, was<br>the father. The child was a stout healthy infant,<br>as was much remarked for its growth. About a<br>month after the child was born, christian Sinclair<br>called upon Jean Petrie, the mother and brought<br>a little corn; but neither of them spoke about the<br>father of the child ; Jean Petrie being afraid of her<br>life, as christian sinclair was a very passionate and<br>violent tempered woman. she called on Jean Petrice again, on wedeusday the 28th April last; about sevan<br>oclock in the evening and sat down in the house,<br>the child being quite well and sitting down in the<br>cradle at the time, she sent the child's mother out<br>for a bottle if Ale, and while thus absent and no-<br>other person being in the house, she wickedly forc-<br>ed quantity of arsenic which she had previously<br>procured evidently for that purpose, down<br>the infant's throat, who, when its mother returned<br>turned the child crying pitsously as in great pain, and<br>began to retch and vomit, which margaret sin-<br>clair immediately covered with ashes saying the<br>child had a filthy throat. In a very short time she<br>went away, and at the door returned twice, to tell<br>Jean Petrie, not to let any person know that she<br>had been there. The mother instancy called in<br>her nearest neighbour, Margaret Ballantyne, who<br>had see the child in good health and spirits, only<br>a quarter of an hour after Christian Sinclair had<br>been there, and who was much surprised at seeing<br>the child look so ill. Mr John Edgar, a professional<br>gentleman, was immediately sent for, who ordered<br>an emetic, and preserved the contents of the stom-<br>ach for examination; but, notwithstanding, the<br>child languished in great agony till about four<br>o'clock next Morning, when it died. The body<br>was then opened and exhibited the symtoms of<br>having died in consequence of a mineral poison<br>having been administered, which was found to be<br>arsenic. Margarat sinclair appears to have been<p>early determined on destroying this innocent babe<br>as she had applied first to a  Marjory Scatter, resid-<br>ing in Kirkwall, who likewise had a child to her<br>brother, the said Thomas Sinclair, so far beck as<br>the beginning of January 1813, four months before<br>the deed was committed, for poison for the rats, as<br>she alledged, but who did not succeed. MrEric Grant,<br>to whom she had gone to purchase some; having<br>refused to give her any, without a line from some<br>respectable man. Happy would it have been for<br>this depraved and wicked woman, if she had then<br>given up her infernal intention, and seriously<br>thought on amending her conduct and manner of<br>living in the world ; but no! the Devil is seldom baf-<br>fled, when once he gets a firm hold of the human<br>heart. Upwards of a month after, viz. on the 7th of<br>February following, she again applied to William<br>Petrie, a cooper in Xirkwall, for rats poison, and<br>prevailed upon him to buy her some from the same. Mr<br>Grant, as if for his own use in the shop. He ac-<br>cordingly bought a sixpence worth of arsenic from<br>Mr Grant, to whom he gave a receipt for the same,<br>which he, in two days after, delivered to Margaret<br>Sinclair, tied up in a small parcel as he got it, and<br>which she, most unfortunately, used in Murdering<br>a harmless innocent infant, in the way above stated.<br>Thus coolly and deliberately, violating the most<br>sacred law of her country, as well as of the most<br>high God, forfeiting her natural life to pacify<br>the one, and endangering the salvation of her im-<br>mortal soul part redemption,  which cannot satisfy<br>the other. All these circumstance were more fully<br>stated, and most impartially proved, at her trial,<br>where she appeared very hardened and unconcerned.<br>Even after the awful Sentence of the law was pro-<br>nounced, she did not seen, in the smallest degree,<br>sensible of her melancholy and lamentable situation,<br>since her confinement she was visited by seve-<br>ral Clergymen of the City, and Mr Porteous, the<br>chaplin of the Tolbooth, has been indefatigable in<br>his excrtions to bring her to a proper sense of duty,<br>and in administering spiritual comfort to her im-<br>mortal soul.. She Was brought to the Scaffold this<br>day, Wednesday 29th december 1813, supported<br>by a man on each side, and instantly mounted the<br>drop. The Executioner then placed the Rope round<br>her neck, and gave her a handkerchief, which she<br>was to use as a signal, and which she dropped be-<br>fore he could come off the platform. She was in-<br>stantly launched into eternity, about half past three<br>o'clock amidst a very great concourse of spectators.<br>After hanging the usual time her body was left<br>down and delivered over for dissection. <p></p>
