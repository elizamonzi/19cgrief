	<h2>Transcription</h2>
	<p> An account of a barbarous and cruel<p>MURDER<p>Committed on the body JAMES PARK, late bleacher.<p>Pollock Shaws, by Robert Mitchell, changekeeper at Strabung<p>on Wednesday the 10th of October I792.<p>HOW lamentable must it be to the feel-<br>ings  of the human heart to hear of<br>of an account of the following<br>murder committed in  this vicinity,<br>after hearing of so many crimes of the deep-<br>est nature so recently committed.  This age<br>boasts of, it's refinement, but, I cannot see<br>wherein it lies;  it be not as an eminent poet<br>expresses it, Refined in the ways of Hell.  In<br>no  period prior to this, has Glasgow and it's<br>neighbourhood, exhibited such a black list<br>of  the most attrocious crimes wantonly and<br>daringly committed (and many  of, them too with<br>impunity) as it has done for these last six years,<br>and alas! there appears but little signs of any<br>amendments! <p>On Wednesday  the 10 th of Ocober  1792; <br>as James Park was going home from Glasgow,<br>to his bleachfield at Pollockshaws; he went<br>into the housc of Robert Mitchell, innkeep-<br>er at Strabungo to  get a refreshment, and<br>having forgotten a bundle in that house, he<br>turned back after he had been some way upon<br>the road from the house, when he missed the<br>bundle; in order to inquire for it, Mitchell<br>denied that he had left it there, and Park af-<br>firmed that he had; upon which some alterca-<br>tion arose, when Mitchell seizing a peck-weight<br>with which he sold meal, and struck Park so<br>severely upon the head that he expired in<br>the greatest agony in a few minutes after.<p>It is to be wished that no more of these<br>shocking barbarities may pass unpunished,<br>which has of late been too much the case, the<br>utmost exertion of the law is necessary to curb<br>this growing evil among us; for murderers,<br>are dangerons persons in society. and if they<br>pass unpunished,  no person can be safe; nor<br>are Judges capable of bringing them to their<br>deserts unless they are assisted in their inqui-<br>ries by those who know the truth, and those <br>persons who  know murders. and do not<br>come-forward and give their evidence of all<br>they know about them, become guilty of the<br>blood of the murdered, along with them be-<br>cause they acknowledge that they do not hold<br>it a crime worthy of punishment whereas the<br>word of  God says. Num. xxxv. 20. Whoso<br>killeth any person, the murderer shall be put to<br>death by. the mouth of witnesses: but one witness<br>shall not testisy any person to caufe him to die.<br>Verse 31. Moreover ye shall take no satisfac-<br>tion for the life of a murderer. which is guilty<br>of death; but he shall surely  be put to death.<p>XIx. 2I, And thine eye shall not pity; b[]<br>life shall go for life, eye for eye, tooth for tooth,<br>hand for hand, foot for foot, and again, xv,  ii.<br> 7.  The hands of the witnesses shall be first u[] <br>on him to put him to death, and afterward<br>the hands of all the  people; so thou shalt put<br>evil away from among you. Since Scripture <br>so  plainly points out our duty, I need say no <br>more; but conclude with some observations<br>by another hand upon a similiar occasion. <p>It was a proverb among our ancestors.<br>That the crime of murder would not hide,<br>The many recent examples of daring and hor-<br>rid murders that have been committed in this<br>country without the murderers being brought<br>to punishment for their horrid offences, would<br>almost seem to destroy the force of this pro-<br>verb. The fault must surely lie somewhere,<br>either by the carelesness of those who are en-<br>trusted with the important office of bringing<br>them to punishment, or, in the people not be-<br>ing at the pains to make the necessary enquiry<br>into the circumstances of the matter to detect<br>the guilty person, and give the proper evi-<br>dence against  them to lead to a conviction.<br>It has more than, once occurred, that a shoc-<br>king murder has been committed in this town<br>and neighbourhood, and sometimes no enqui-<br>ry was made at all for the perpetrator, ar o-<br>ther times, a person accused, examined, and<br>put in jail, then found bail to answer in fix<br>months, in the usual form, and no more<br>was heard of the matter. In the name of<br>God, do you not all know, that the guilt of<br>that blood which is innocently shed, is requi-<br>ed at large? and how must it fare then with<br>those who wilfully screens a person suspected<br>of murder from justice; surely he is equally<br>guity with the shedder of blood.<p>You will say you thought the person not<br>guity, why then did you not convince a<br>Judge and Jury of his innocence? and there<br>by satisfy the people at large, that farther<br>enquiry might have been made; for the real<br>murderer; for I am  fully persuaded, that<br>were every person in their proper stations ac-<p>tive in discovering and punishing them, not<br>one murderer out of a hundred could possibly<br>escape, not is it any mercy to them to spare<br>them; for their conscience is still such an ac-<br>cuser of them. that their lives are imbittered,<br>and they can never live happy until they are<br>detected and brought to punishment.</p>
