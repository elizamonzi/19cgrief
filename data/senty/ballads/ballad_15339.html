	<p> A Full and Particular Account of the Trial and Sentence of JOHN<br>MILLER and WILLIAM STORRIER, accused of an Assault and<br>Rape on a Girl, 14 years of age, who are to be publicly Whipped<br>through the Town of Dundee on the 4th of October next, and there-<br>after Banished beyond Seas for 14 years; as also, of WILLIAM<br>ROBERTSON, for committing a Similar Crime, and who is to be<br>Executed at Cupar in Fife, on Thursday the 31st of October next.<p>AT Perth, on Friday the 13th Septem-<br>ber, 1822, JOHN MILLER and WILL-<br>STORIER, accused of the crime of an as- <br>sault, with intent to a commit rape on<br>a girl about 14 years of age, in the neigh-<br>bourhood of Glammis, on the 5th of May<br>last, were placed at the bar. The Court<br>was then ordered to be cleared?but we<br>understand that they pleaded Not Guilty.<p>A considerable number of witnesses<br>were examined for the prosecution, as were<br>likewise a number in exculpation on be-<br>half of the pannels.<p>Mr Hope addressed the Court for the<br>prosecution, and Mr Thomson for Miller<br>and Storrier, after which the evidence was<br>summed up by one of their Lordships?<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and the Jury, after having been enclosed<br>for nearly an hour, returned a verdict, by<br>a plurality of voices finding the pannels<br>guilty of the assault, with an intent to com-<br>mit rape.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <p>On Saturday the 14th, he Court met at<br>nine o'clock, Miller and Storrier were then<br>put to the ban Mr Hope moved the judg-<br>ment of the Court; and Mr Thomson ad-<br>dressed the Court at considerable length,<br>in mitigation of punishment.<p>Lord Hermand, in a speech of great<br>energy, pointed ous-the aggravated nature<br>of the crime of which the panels had been<br>convicted, and proposed that they should,<br>in addition to the punishment of trans- <br>portation, be whipped through the town<br>of Dundee.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <p>Lord Succoth, in the course of his ob-<br>servations on the crime of which the pan-<br>els had been convicted, remarked, that it<br>was clear that they had been both as-<br>sisting in the perpetration of this most a-<br>trocious crime ; that it was indeed a very<br>rare occurrence for two men to be concern-<br>ed in such an offence, the one holding the<br>feet of their victim, while the other was<br>attempting to commit the brutal act.<br>There had been cases in which greater<br>marks of violence were exhibited, but that<br>would not, in any way, militate in their<br>favour. It was not necessary for the pan-<br>nels to knock down the girl, because, from<br>her tender years, she was unable to resist<br>the strength of two men. It was also<br>proved, that they had gone deliberately a-<br>bout their criminal purpose, by dragging<br>the girl into a wood; this shows, that<br>they were determined to effect their ob-<br>ject?the girl crying out and making all<br>the resistance she could. It appeared in<p>evidence, that the girl, who was only 14<br>years of age, continued in a state of fever<br>for some days after. Under all the cir-<br>cumstances of the case, therefore, he a-<br>greed with the suggestions of Lord Her-<br>mand, as to the expediency of the panels<br>being publicly whipped, in addition to the<br>punishment of transportation.  His Lord-<br>ship concluded, by addressing the panels<br>in a most impressive manner, as to what<br>ought to be the line of conduct pursued<br>by them after they should leave this coun-<br>try.<p>The sentence of the Court was read,<br>ordaining  Miller and Storrier to be public-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>ly whipped through the town of Dundee,<br>on the 4th day of October next, and there-<br>after, to be banished beyond seas for 14<p>years.<p>William Robertson, accused of a simi-<br>lar act, was then put to the bar, and the<br>Court cleared, as had been done in the for-<br>mer trial, during the examination of the<br>evidence, &c.; and the Court continued<br>shut from 11 to past 7 o'clock at night.<br>In the course of that time a great number<br>of witnesses, both for the prosecution and<br>in exculpation, were examined. The ge-<br>neral outline of the evidence was under-<br>stood to be, that the female, who lived near<br>Cupar Fife, had been violently assaulted,<br>severely wounded, and actually ravished<br>by the pannel.<p>After some pleading by the counsel for<br>the Crown and the prisoner, and the case<br>being summed up by one of their Lord-<br>ships, the jury retired, and were enclosed<br>for about an hour, when they returned<br>with a verdict, finding, by a plurality of<br>voices, the pannel guilty of rape; but un-<br>animously and strongly recommended him<br>to mercy.<p>Mr Hope having moved the judgment<br>of the Court.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<p>Lord Succoth addressed Robertson in a<br>short but most energetic speech, stating<br>that the Court had no alternative but to<br>pass the last sentence of the law.<p>Lord Hermand also made a few obser-<br>vations on the nature and enormity of the<br>offence, and concluded by sentencing Ro-<br>bertson to be hanged at Cupar Fife, on the<br>31st October next.<p>The prisoner heard the awful doom pro-<br>nounced with great composure and firmness.<br>He was a good-looking middle aged man.<br>and has, as we were informed, a family.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>" PRICE ONE PENNY."</p>
