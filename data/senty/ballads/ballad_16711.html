	<h2>Transcription</h2>
	<p> A copy of a very affecting and interesting letter,<br>written by William Perrie, before his execution,<br>on Wednesday, and which was found in the<br>Condemned Cell, after his Execution, addressed<br>to Mr Masson, one of the elders who attended<br>him when in Jail.-Copied from the Glasgow<br>Chronicle of October 23. 1837.<p>My Dear Friend,-Your kind attention, your friendly visits, and<br>labours of love towards me, when a prisoner in the tolbooth of Pais-<br>ley, both before and after sentence of death up to the moment in<br>which I pressed your hand for the last time on earth, were felt by<br>me with that gratitude which is best acknowledged by the silent<br>glows and emotions of the heart, and gives more satisfaction than<br>any language I could adopt under such painful circumstances as I<br>was placed in, and though the memorial must, with other records,<br>perish amidst the wreck of years,yet surely it is registered on High<br>an Everlasting Record in the Sky. -To- Masson, elder, by his<br>loving but unfortunate friend, William Perrie.<p>The parting of Perrie with his children, on the night before his<br>execution, was hea t rending in the extreme. He cried like an in-<br>fant, and embraced them so eagerly as almost to hurt their tender<br>names, and implored upon them the blessing of God, exhorting<br>them at the same time to follow undeviatingly the paths of religion<br>and virtue. It appears that he, if not jealous of his first wife, at<br>least watched her so closely in company, as to make himself quite<br>ridiculous.<p>Ancient Gold Coins found in  the  Cathedral  of Glasgow.- On<br>Thursday last, three of the workmen, two masons and a labourer,<br>employed in renovating the interior of our venernble Cathedral,<br>found 160 ancient gold coins under the pavement, about five inches<br>from the base of one of the pillars which the wall lately taken down<br>intersrcted, and which divided the Outer  High Church from the<br>Nave.-These workmen kept the secret of their good luck from their<br>fellows who were employed near them, and sold the gold to a jew.<br>eller for L.84 18s.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The thing however spunked out, and Captain<br>Miller ultimately managed to get possesslon of the pieces mention-<br>ed above, along with the unlucky  finders and&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;L.71 of the money<br>they had received for their prize.- The pieces are very thin, and<br>appeared just to have been slipped in at a wide joint of the pave-<br>ment, as they all  fell down  when  the stone was removed.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The<br>whole of the coins are in a state of most perfect preservation, and<br>consist of 62 Nobles of one of the early Edwards of England, about<br>the size of half-a-crown, on one side of which there is a ship, with<br>a figure on deck bearing a sword in the one hand and a shield in the<br>other: and round the rim " Edward Dei Gra Rex." is entire.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The<br>reverse side has a large cross in the centre, and it is  surrounded al-<br>ternately by crowns and the fleur-de-lis.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This coin is of most beau-<br>tiful workmanship.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The other coins are smaller, about the size of a<br>shilling, and amount in number to 58.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On one side there is the fi-<br>gure of St. Andrew on the cross; on the other a lion, surmounted<br>by a crown, and " Robertus del Gracia Rex Scotorum," perfectly<br>legible.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The whole are now in the hands of Captain Miller, and a<br>full examination of the parties concerned has been taken, in order to<br>be transmitted to the proper authorities.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the meantime an offi-<br>cer of Police has been stationed in the church, in order to secure<br>for her majesty's use whatever may again turn up in the gold way.<br>- An ingenious  Correspondet, who writes us on the above matter,<br>states, that supposing these coins to have been lent out at five per<br>cent. compound interest, five hundred and  thirty-seven years ago,<br>about the period they may have lain buried, the following would be<br>the pretty little sum to which it would have now amounted, viz :<br>Thirty five billions, one hundred and forty-seven thousand one hun-<br>dred and sixty-four millions, nine hundred and eighteen thousand,<br>six hundred and fifty pounds,-or 43 934 times  the amount of the<br>national debt!-Herald.<p>" Yesterday (Wednesday) the persons who discovered the aeins<br>were taken into custody and underwent an examination, in the<br>course of which the whole circumstances attending their discovery<br>and subsequent sale were brought out. We believe there is no in-<br>tention to punish the poor fellows, but they have been called upon<br>to refund the whole of the money which they raised. The coins<br>will of course be retained as treasure trove on the part of the Crown.<br>They ought to be distributed to different public museums,with a note<br>of the exact situation and circumstances under which they have been<br>found,-Argus.<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Muir, Printer.</p>
