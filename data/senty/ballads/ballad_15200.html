	<p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;TRIAL.<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  HIGH COURT OF JUSTICIARY, July 15,1830,<p>A full, true, and particular Account of the Trial of Mr David Bartie,<br>writer, before the High Court of Justiciary,yesterday, for violating<br>the person of Margaret Gray, a girl fourteen years of age, servant<br>in the house in which the pannel lodged, in East Cumberland-<br>Street, Edinburgh, and which Trial occupied the Court eleven<br>hoars.<p>The Indictment, after commencing in the usual form, set&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;forthy<br>That albeit, by the laws of this and every other well governed&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;realm'<br>Rape is a crime of an heinous nature and severely punishable:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;yet<br>true it was and of verity, that David Bertie, the prisoner at the&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;bar,<br>was guilty of the same, he having, on the 10th day of May last, in&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a<br>house situated in. East Cumberland-street, then in the occupation&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; of<br>Mrs Jane Skirving, and in a room in the said house, which he (the pri-<br>soner) occupied as a lodger, wickedly solicited Margaret Gray, servant<br>to the siad  Jane Skirving, and on her rejecting his solicitations, did<br>attack her with force and violence in the said room;?and that on the<br>said Margaret Gray getting away from him, he did some time after-<br>wards in the passage of the said house, again attack the said Margaret<br>Gray, and did seize her by the arm, and forcibly drag her back  into<br>his room, wherein, in spite of all the resistance in her power, he con-<br>summated the crime, with great force and violence?[and the particu-<br>lars of which, as stated in the indictment, are unfit for publication.]<p>The indictment then went on to state, that the pannel, having been<br>apprehended, and taken before the Sheriff substitute, had emitted be-<br>fore him, on the 11th and 13th of May two several declarations which,<br>being to be used in evidence against him, had been lodged in the usu-<br>al place for his inspection,  as also a medical certificate signed by Dr<br>Thatcher, and another medical certificate, signed by Dr  Black, surgeon<br>to the Police Establishment,  and by Mr A. L. Black, and Mr Sidey,<br>surgeons,?and also one other article, which, though it was named in<br>the indictment and produced on the trial,  it would be improper to<br>mention here.<p>The trial commenced about twelve o'clock ; and the prisoner hav-<br>ing been placed at the bar, pleaded Not Guilty.<p>The Examination of Margaret Gray (who is not more than fourteen<br>years of age, and who is a daughter of very decent parents at Joppa,<br>where her father is a mason) occupied two hours and a quarter.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She<br>underwent  a long and very minute cross-examination;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but she was<br>not materially shaken in her principal evidence.<p>There were twenty witnesses in all, for the Crown, amongst whom<br>were. Margaret Gray, Mrs Skirving, Catherine Johnston, Ann Gray,<br>the Medical  Gentlemen mentioned  in&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the indictment,  Lieutenant<br>Harvey, and Serjeant Charles Stewart, jun, of the Police Establish-<br>ment.-<p>The alleged facts of the case were, that on the day libelled, the pri-<br>soner and Margaret Gray being alone, in Mrs Skirving's house, in the<br>absence of Mrs S., and the rest of the family, the prisoner offered the<br>poor girl first one pound note, then two pound notes, and then three<br>pound notes, if she would comply with his wishes. These tempta-<br>tions having been rejected by the girl, the pannel, as alleged, next<br>proceeded to use violence in the way libelled in the indictment. After<br>the commission of the crime, he had left the house ; but he returned<br>to it agian,and was in bed when he was apprehended, about eleven<br>o'clock on the same night. He has all along positively denied the<br>crime. <p>The prisoner is a-young man, about twenty eight years of age, dark<br>complexion, roman nose, short stature, and of gentlemanly dress and<br>appearance. He was Clerk to a Writer.<p>The exculpatory evidence occupied a very considerable portion&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of<br>time, and there were several very respectable witnesses to the cha-<br>racter of the pannel.<p>The Lord justice Clerk having made a long and able summing up<br>or the evidence, the Jury retired to consider of their verdict.<p>During the absence of the jury, the pannel remained in a state of<br>the utmost agitation and anxiety. He repeatedly gazed round, him<br>with an indescribably haggard expression on his countenance, over<br>which hung a cloud of the blackest gloom and most dismal melancholy.<br>At times he laid his head down on his hands and arms ; and for a few<br>moments seemed asleep; and then he would raise his head again with<br>the same unaltered expression. It struck almost every person in Court<br>that his appearance now was like that of a maniac  or  rather of  a<br>drunk man, arousing from sleep and trying to collect his dissipated  <br>ideas.<p> After an absence of about twenty minutes, the jury returned&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;at&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  <br>eleven o' clock at night and pronounced by their Chancellor the fol.<br>lowing-verdict :- My Lords: Owing to the contradictory statement&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>or the evidence, we find the charge Not Proven.'<p>On hearing these joyful words, the prisoner sprung to his feet, clap .<br>ped  his, hands, uttered an exclamation of gratitude to the jury,  and<br>(all in  an instant) appeared&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;as if he&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;wished to  seize  his hat.<br>bound at once out of the Court.<p>Pearson who shook the prisoner by the hand ,state that it felt&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;like<br>the clammy hand of a person newly dead, or dying.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; .....................................<p>Forbes & Owen, Printers, 118, High Street, First stair within the close.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
