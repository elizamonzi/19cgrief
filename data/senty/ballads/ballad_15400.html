	<p> SECOND EDITION,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Murder.<p><p>About four o'clock on Saturday morning,<br>(March 12) the watchman on the Netherbow<br>station found a man lying on the High Street,<br>insensible,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and bleeding&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;severely.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On in-<br>quiry, he found that he had just been thrown<br>from the window of a house of an  infamous<br>character, three storeys high,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and on pro-<br>ceeding up to which he found four women<br>and a man, who were immediately taken in-<br>to custody.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  The unhappy victim was re-<br>moved to the Infirmary, where it was found<br>his skull was fractured ; he lingered until a-<br>bout midday, when he died.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As he continu-<br>ed insensible up to the time of his ueath, it<br>became,  of course,  impossible to ascertain<br>from him the cause of this revolting crime;<br>but the following particulars, which we lave&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>reason&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to  believe authentic,  may tend to<br>throw some degree of light on the proceed-<br>ings.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The room in which the parties were<br>assembled was rented by a girl named Chr-<br>lotte Dundas ; but we believe that the othrs,<br>Elizabeth and Margaret Henderson, Cate-<br>rine Hay, and Archidald Allan, resided thre<br>also, at least occassionally ; though how thy<br>contrived to do so, is not easily to be un-<br>derstood, as the room itself is hardly so large<br>as on ordinary-sized  beb-closet.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  The  de-<br>ceased&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;himself,  whose  name was Stewart,<br>was also frequently  there,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and  cohabited<br>with  Margaret  Henderson.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This much is<br>certain, that, at eleven o'clock on&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Friday<br>night, he was met going down stairs, out of<br>the house, by a women living in the same<br>Irnd.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He was then without his hat,  and it<br>is remarkable, that when found by the watch-<br>man, there was no hat lying near him ; but<br>on going into the house, a hat, which Allan<br>had on at the time, was identified as Stewart's,<br>but the cap or bonnet usually worn hy Allan<br>was nowhere to be found.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After having been<br>seen by the woman at elevec o'clock there<br>was no farther trace of him that we are a-<br>ware of till the  time of the catastrophe.<br>About four in  the morning,  a shoemaker,<br>who lives below the room, heard a quarrel a-<br>mong the inmatos.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and scuffling: he also<br>states, that he heard the body in the act of<br>falling,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and  the  crash&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;on&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;pavement.<br>This&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;might well be;  for the front of the<br>house is scratched in various places, evi-<br>vidently caused by the rubbing of somebody<br>against it ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and a piece of old wood, which<br>projected a very short way from the house,<br>was broken by the descent.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There are two<br>windows near the place,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;one in the room<br>itself, and one on the staircase or landing;<br>and it is supposed to be from the latter that<br>the deceased was thrown, in a direction slant-<br>ing down the street, a, the scratchas already<br>alluded to run in that direction,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;till they<br>reached the broken wood,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;whence the fall<br>seems to have been prependicular.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There is<br>a family that lives on the same staircase, who<br>had sub-let the room to Dundas, and who,<br>it would appear, must have heard something<br>of  the struggles and fighting, but they deny<br>all knowledge of the matter.  The prisoners<br>have all been remitted.  Stewart, we believe.<br>war about twenty years of age, and the pris-<br>oners are none of them much older.<p><br>Sanderson, Printer,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Edinburgh&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
