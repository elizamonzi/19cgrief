Upon her Confession, she was then committed to York Castle,and whilst she was<br>there, to vindicate the People call'd Quakers, she published this Confession.<p>INasmuch as I Anne Fogget have gone to the Meetings of the People called<br>Quakers, and have therefore been accounted one of that People, yet have been<br>Blame-worthy in my not walking according to the Teachings of the Grace of GOD,<br>and Advice of the aforesaid People, which occasion'd a Dislike in the Meeting I<br>frequented, touching my marrying with Abraham Foggets so that I  know not of<br>any one in all that Meeting, that was satisfied with it. Therefore I fully believe,<br>if I had minded, and taken heed to the Grace of GOD, and Advice of those Peo-<br>ple, who advis'd against it, I had been preserv'd from this abominable Wickedness of<br>barbaroufly murdering my Husband; which I was led to by giving Way to the Temp-<br>tations of the Enemy of my Soul, to the great Dishonour of GOD, and Reproach<br>of all Christians: For which I do justly ly in Bonds, confessing that I deserve to<br>suffer what the Law provides in that Case: So lies my Soul at the Mercy of<br>GOD, and farther desire, that what I have done may not be cast, or lie as a Re*<br>proach, upon the said People call'd Quakers; and that this my wicked Action may<br>be a Warning to all others who may ly under the said Temptation.<p>At the Assizes held March 1715. she was Try'd and Conviced before Judge Dor-<br>mer, and accordingly received Sentance of Dath. Upon which, she pleaded her be<br>ing with Child, which, indeed, she was by her unfortunate Husband, and accordingly<br>was brought to Bed in the Castle.' But the  last Assizes, August the 6th, she was cal-<br>led to her former Sentance, her Child taken from her, and she ordered to prepare for<br>Death.<p>EDINBURGH, Printed by MARGARET&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;REID.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1716-</p>
