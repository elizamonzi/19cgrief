	<p> JAMES  McMOURTRIE<p>Died 24th September, 1889,<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  Aged 77 Years.<p><p>Right sorry were we all to hear of James McMourtrie's death,<br>Few cleverer, worthier, gude old chaps has death deprived of breath:<br>Well known as "Old Mortality" through all the country side,<br>He kept old gravestones in repair within a district wide.<p><p>The inscriptions which he cut were always distinct and neat,<br>And few the sculptors were who could Mourtrie in this way beat:<br>Nor yet confined he his art to monuments alone,<br>But engraved on copper, silver, wood, and steel as well as stone.<p><p>Full many a village sign board his handiwork displays,<br>His stamps for marking sacks and tools will be used many days;<br>When at the smithy cronies meet and have a social crack,<br>They will talk abont him and will say," a clever man was Mac."<p><p>A king 'mongst tradesmen too he  was, all his work tools he made,<br>(And of none except a smith can the selfsame be said,)<br>He made machines to restrike files and iron to caukers make,<br>But of none of these inventions did he advantage take.<p><p>A thinking, handy, plodding man-a genius scarce known-<br>Who had he been placed better, as an artist would have shone-<br>He quietly slipped through a life of seventy seven years,<br>Content with little while he lived within this vale of tears.<p><p>Riches he never coveted, nor for them ever strove,<br>For such is not the object of the true artist's love;<br>For hours he'd labour eidently within some auld kirkyard,<br>Then lay him down and rest a while upon the fresh green sward.<p><p>His fare was of the humblest, and often little more<br>Than bread and Cheese and water composed his whole store;<br>But when weariness, or grief, or care his honest heart oppressed,<br>He would take a gill of whiskey, saying," let it be the best."<p><p>Who on his lowly gravestone will cut McMourtrie's name,<br>And thus unto posterity preserve friend James's fame ?<br>That it should be forgotten, pity and shame would be,<br>For well he earned his well known name of " Old Mortality."<p>D.S.</p>
