	<h2>Transcription</h2>
	<p> Copy Letter,<p>Relative to the Case of these three unfortunate young<br>Boys, CHARLES M'LAREN, THOMAS GRIERSON, and<br>JAMES M'EWEN, who were lately Sentenced to be<br>Executed at Edinburgh, on Wednesday the 12th<br>February, 1823, for Housebreaking and Theft.<p>THE following very sensible and considerate Letter, relative to<br>the case of these unhappy young boys, lately condemned to<br>be executed in this City, for Housebreaking and Theft, is copied<br>from the Edinburgh Weekly Journal of Wednesday the 22d of<br>January last; and, we certainly concur in opinion with the writer,<br>" in viewing the probable execution of this sentence with feelings<br>of deep regret, and of considering the punishment of these boys<br>as arising in a great measure, if not wholly, from the untoward<br>circumstances in which it has been their unhappy lot to be placed;"<br>yet, the crimes for which they were convicted has become of late<br>so very prevalent in this place, and almost all too perpetrated by<br>youths of their age and character, that an example, perhaps, has<br>become absolutely necessary.<p>To the Editor of the Edinburgh Weekly Journal.<p>Sir....I observe from the newspapers, that a few days ago, several<br>boys, from thirteen to seventeen years of age, have been condemn-<br>ed to death in this city, for the crime of housebreaking and theft<br>and that in passing sentence, the presiding Judge intimated to<br>two of them, that they were to expect no alleviation of the sentence<br>Indeed, from the crime having become very prevalent in this part<br>of the country, and from the circumstance of the public prosecu-<br>tor's having declined to restrict the libel to an arbitrary punish-<br>ment, it is generally believed that it is intended to carry the dread-<br>ful sentence into execution.<p>I am far from being singular in viewing the probable execution<br>of this sentence with feelings of deep regret, and of considering<br>the punishment of these unhappy boys as arising in a great mea-<br>sure, if not wholly, from the untoward circumstances in which it<br>has been their unhappy lot to be placed. Need I recapitulate the<br>history of such beings ? Born probably of vicious and depraved<br>parents, neglected in their education, placed among the most<br>worthless as companions, encouraged to pilfer by cunning and<br>unprincipled resetters, and not arrived at the period of life, when<br>the reasoning powers can enable them to counteract the errors of<br>their education,... they are brought to the gallows as mere victims<br>of misfortune, whose fate can excite only pity and commisseration.<p>Is it therefore just, or consistent with the rules of enlightened<br>jurisprudence, to inflict upon such young and misguided creatures,<br>that punishment which is the doom of the murderer and assassin ?<br>Severe as our laws have often been held in punishing with death<br>crimes short of murder, they contract a feature of barbarity when<br>enforced against persons of such tender years.<p>I think it unnecessary to enlarge on this matter. My sole mo-<br>tive is to draw the public attention to the case, and in this way<br>perhaps, to induce an application to be made for a commutatien<br>of the sentence, before it is too late. I am, &c.<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  AMICUS JUVENTUTIS.<p>Jan. 21, 1823.<p>We having heard, with great satisfaction, that these unfortunate<br>boys have behaved in the most becoming manner since their con-<br>demnation, and has given good grounds for believing that they are<br>indeed striving tor an interest in the atoning blood of a crucified<br>saviour. We sincerely pray, that they may obtain pardon for all<br>their manifold transgressions, that they may be supported through<br>life, and at death, by a firm reliance on the sufferings and merit of<br>the Redeemer of lost mankind, and ultimately be admitted into<br>the kingdom of glory; and may all others, particularly the youth,<br>take warning by their awful fate, and shun all evil ways and com-<br>panions ere it be too late. Edinburgh....Printed for James M'Lean.</p>
