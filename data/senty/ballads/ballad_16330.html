	<h2>Transcription</h2>
	<p> a Symposium of Scottish Songs.<p>THERE was ance held a gran' meetin' o' Scottish<br>sangs. The date thereof was some time<br>afore or after the year " Auchty-nine ;" the<br>place canna be fixed wi' the same exactness, <br>but it was probably near " The Banks an' Braes o' <br>Bonnie Doon," in honour o' the " Lad that was born<br>in Kyle." " Macgregor's Gathering" was naething tae<br>this. Sangs cam poorin' in frae every quarter. Here <br>cam " Jolly shepherds that whistle through the glen,"<br>an' " Braw, braw lads frae Gala Water ;" an' there<br>was abundance o' national music in the shape o' " A<br>Hundred Pipers, an' a', an' a'," accompanied by " The<br>Pibroch o' Donal' Dhu;" while yonder, in gallant<br>array, "The Campbells are comin'," "The Bonnets o'<br>Bonnie Dundee," an' a numerous company o' others.<br>It was moved by " Auld Robin Gray," an' seconded<br>by " The Laird o' Cockpen," that " Logie o' Buchan "<br>tak the honoured place in "The Old Arm Chair." The<br>repast that followed wasna what mortals would be apt<br>to think the choicest, the delicacies bein' sic as " The<br>Haggis o' Dunbar,""Bannocks o' Barley Meal,""Caller<br>Herrin'," an' "Cauld Kail in Aberdeen." For this<br>meetin', hooever, "Willie brewed a peck o' maut," an' <br>Neil Gow had no' yet bade " Fareweel tae Whisky,"<br>so that, after a', they micht hae sung something else<br>on the occasion than " Contented wi' little, an' cantie<br>wi' mair." Amang the ladies o' high rank present were<br>" Annie Laurie," " Mary Morrison," " Bonnie Bessie<br>Lee," " Roy's Wife o' Aldivalloch," " Highland Mary,"<br>"Bonnie Jean," "The Lassie wi' the lint white locks,"<br>" Maggie Lauder," an' " Auld Joe Nicholson's Bonnie<br>Nannie ;" while prominent amang the other sex were<br>"John Anderson, my jo, John," "Duncan Gray," "Tarn<br>Glen," "John Grumlie," " Wanderin' Willie," "Jock<br>o' Hazeldean," "The Rantin', Roarin' Hielanman,"<br>"Johnnie Cope," "Alister M'Alister," an' "The Sodger<br>Laddie." The Chairman gave an account o' his wan-<br>derings, which had extended frae " Maidenkirk tae<br>John o' Groats." He had seen "The Bonnie Woods<br>o' Craigie Lea," had wandered by the banks o' " Afton<br>Water," amang the "The Braes o' Ballochmyle" and<br>" The Birks o' Aberfeldy." Mony hours had he spent<br>amang " The bloom o' my ain native heather;" he had<br>plucked mony " A Rosebud by his Early Walk," an'<br>kent by name a' " The Flowers o' the Forest." But<br>where'er he strayed he had never forgotten that he was<br>" Woo'd an' Married an' a'," an' that, " For the Sake o'<br>Somebody," he lo'ed best " My Ain Fireside." At<br>every point o' the compass he had consoled himsel'<br>wi' " I'll awa' tae Nannie, O;" an' indeed, he hoped<br>they would a' be able to say at the close o' life, " Happy<p>we've been a' thegither." " Duncan Gray " havin' just<br>been rejected by Maggie," was in a very morose mood<br>?wished he was " Where Helen lies," said " She was<br>fair an' fause that caused his smart," an', to cheer himsel'<br>up, sang "Oh, are ye sleepin', Maggie ?" at the end o'<br>which "Maggie Lauder" requested him tae "Behave<br>himsel' afore folk." "John Grumlie swore by the<br>licht o' the moon" that "Ance he wished he'd ne'er<br>been married," an' for this purpose he had gane "O'er<br>the water tae Charlie," but that noo he had learned<br>that his wife was " A Winsome Wee Thing," an' that<br>as she " Lo'ed him best ava'," he should henceforth<br>go " Marching Along," with the motto, " Hame, Sweet<br>Hame." At this stage entered " Dainty Davie," accom-<br>panied by " Jessie, the Flower o' Dunblane," an'<br>"When she cam' ben, she bobbit, she bobbit." Envious<br>a little o' her sister, " Annie Laurie" whispered, "Gang<br>doun the burn, Davie," an' then " Whistle and I'll<br>come tae ye, my lad." Davie took her at her word,<br>an' in goin' hummed " Dinna think, bonnie lassie, I'm<br>gaun tae leave ye." The " Laird o' Cockpen " thocht<br>there was " Nae luck aboot the hoose," where sic<br>sentimental sangs were sung ; he didna care for "A kiss<br>ahint the door," "Come under my plaidie," "Dinna ask<br>me gin I lo'e thee," " My Nannie, O," " O could I<br>wi' Fancy stray," an' sic like. He preferred some-<br>thing he could clutch; for instance, " Gie me a lass<br>wi' a lump o' land," " Hey for a lass wi' a tocher," an'<br>" Jenny's Bawbee." " The Rantin', Roarin' Hielan-<br>man " suggested that for the remainder of the evenin'<br>the laird should be tied up in " Rab Rorrison's<br>Bonnet," but Rab interposed, sayin', " It canna,<br>mauna, wunna be." After this there was a dance.<br>" John Anderson " began tae play " Within a mile o'<br>Edinbro' Toun," when he was interrupted by " Jock o'<br>Hazeldean," wha wished him tae play first " God save<br>the King." "Never mind the king," cried "Bonnie<br>Prince Charlie," wha was immediately knocked doon<br>wi' a brainch o' " The Auld Oak Tree " by " Johnnie<br>Cope." As he recovered he grumbled oot that he<br>didna like "A' that an,' a that," when he was politely<br>requested to " Whistle ower the lave o't." So the<br>evenin' passed away, till the chairman intimated that,<br>as he " Saw the mune, an' kent her horn," an' as some<br>o' them had evidently rather mair than " A wee<br>drappie in their e'e," it was time to break up, because<br>it wasna becomin' for sic celebrities as them tae sing<br>" We'll not go home till morning." They took the hint,<br>but before leavin' had a final chorus to " Meet again<br>some other nicht" for "The Days o' Auld Lang<br>Syne."&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; W. S.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br></p>
