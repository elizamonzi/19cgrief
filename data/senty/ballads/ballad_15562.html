	<p> DEMPSTER'S<p>APPREHENSION<p>AND<p>CONFESSION.<p>A Full and particular Account the Apprehension of<br>Robert Dempster, junior, Slater in Cupar of Fife,<br>accused of the Murder of M'DONALD, a Flax-<br>Dresser, with his slate-hammer, on the High Road<br>between Craigrothie and Wemyss Hall Gate, a few<br>weeks ago, and who is now lodged in Cupar Jail,<br>having been Apprehended at Doune, on Monday<br>Evening the 25th October 1830.<p>We understand that ROBERT DEMPSTER, junior, slater Cupar<br>Fife, accused of murdering M'Donald, flax-dresser, was apprehended<br>at Doune on Monday night. The circumstances which led to his<br>apprehension are as follow:?As two Highland drovers (one un-<br>derstanding English and the other not) were, on Monday about<br>one o'clock, passing the turnpike gate at Causeway Head, near Stir-<br>ling, they perceived a man resting by the way side, with whom the<br>one that had English entered into conversation. The man, then<br>arose and accompanied them to Doune, and appeared to be in a<br>very melancholy and disconsolate state; asked the road to Ayr;<br>and began to narrate, that about a month ago he was drinking in<br>Fife, and being intoxicated, he struck another man with a slate<br>hammer, who, in consequence, died on Saturday week last; that he<br>intended to go to America. On approaching the Bridge of Allan,<br>he asked one of their plaids, and seemed anxious to conceal him-<br>self. After arriving at Doune, the drover reflecting upon the in-<br>telligence he had received, thought it a duty incumbent upon him<br>to give information to the Civil Authorities in that place. Mr<br>Christie, one of the Perth Sheriff-officers, immediately apprehended<br>the man, and carried him before an intelligent Justice of the Peace<br>in the neighbourhood, who, on exrmining the talkative drover, con-<br>veyed him to Dunblane.<p>On Tuesday morning he underwent a judicial examination be-<br>fore the Sheriff-Substitute and Procurator Fiscal. He acknowledged<br>having fallen in with M'Donald in one Cooper's, a publican, about<br>three miles from Craigrothie, with whom he drank three gills ;<br>that he left the house along with M'Donald, and being urged, and<br>promised a gill on arriving at Ceres, by M'Donald, he accompanied<br>him on the road leading to that place, until they arrived at or<br>about Wemyss Hall gate, where he was irritated by M'Donald<br>telling him he ought to be hung by the neck like Henderson the<br>Murderer, and striking him twice across the shoulder and back<br>with a stick; that he thereon struck M'Donald one blow on the<br>head with his slate hammer, which felled him to the ground, and<br>then threw the hammer at him, which also struck him on the<br>head ; that he immeditely took an indirect road threugh the fields<br>to Cupar, an offered himself up to the Jailor: that on being re-<br>fused admittance, he skulked about Cupar and its immediate vi-<br>cinity, until he heard that M'Donald had died, when he decamped<br>with the intention of going to America. Dempster farther stated,<br>that both parties were in a state of inebriation at the time, and they<br>had no conversation whatever as to money. He was sent off to<br>Cupar Jail on Wednesday.</p>
