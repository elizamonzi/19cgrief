	<p> Trial & Sentence<p><p>Of Two Men and Two Women before the High Court of Jus-<br>ticiary at Edinburgh, on Wednesday the 5th of this month,<br>November, 1823, for the barbarous Murder of Mr John M'-<br>Clure in July last, as he was returning from Ochiltree Sacrament<br>to Ayr, when JAMES ANDERSON and DAVID GLEN<br>were found Guilty, and sentenced to be Executed at Ayr, on<br>Friday the 12th of December next, and their bodies to be given<br>for dissection, with the conversation which took place between<br>them and their visitors after their sentence.<p>Edinburgh, Wednesday Nov. 5th.?This day the High Circuit Court of Justiciary  <br>met, when JAMES ANDERSON, collier, and DAVID GLEN, weaver, MARGA-<br>RET FREW and  MARGARET ANDERSON, all belonging to Ayr, were put to<br>the bar, charged with the murder of Mr John M'CIure, weaver,  on Sunday the 6th<br>of July last.<p>It appeared from the evidence, that on the above day, a number of people from<br>Ayr had been attending the Ochiltree Sacrament, among whom was the deceased, and<br>in the evening about nine o'clock, he, in company with a Mr Thomas Young, a stu-<br>dent in Divinity, were returning home in peace and quietness. In the course of the<br>afternoon, the prisoners had entered the Holmston toll-house, and after drinking for<br>some time, and behaving in a most riotous manner, left the house without paying for<br>the'drink, and carrying away with them several articles belonging to the landlady.?<br>This disgraceful proceeding was but the prelude, to others of a more violent nature.<br>A number of respectable men and women in can who were also returning from Och-<br>iltree were first abused in the very worst language, and then with horrid imprecations.<br>threatened with violence, and it was only by increasing the rapidity of the horse that<br>they escaped,<p>A great many witnesses were examined who fully confirmed the fact that the de-<br>ceased met his death in a clandestine manner.<p>The Jury retired for a short time, and returned with a verdict, finding James An-<br>derson and David Glen. Guilty, and the women Not Guilty, and they were dismissed.<p>His Lordship, in passing sentence, observed?After an anxious investigation into<br>your case ; after weighing the transactions of that fatal night, and after hearing the<br>Counsel in your defence, an intelligent British Jury have found you Guilty of murder.<br>I beseech you to pass the few days allotted you in earth, in preparation for the unnum-<br>berad days of eternity. His Lordship then sentenced him to be Executed at Ayr, on<br>Friday the 12th of December next, and their bodies to be given for dissection.<p>They behaved in a very composed manner in Court, but on retiring to their lonely<br>cell the thought of appearing in another world, weighed heavy on their minds.?The<br>dreadful reality appeared in their view, and the visage of him, who was departed, kept<br>their guilty consciences in awful suspense.  Eternity before then ; judgment ready<br>to meet them ; the guilt of this, as well as former crimes, stinging them like an adder,<br>all combined to harrow their feelings and cast a deep colouring on their gloomy cell.<br>Next morning, the dawn.of day, removed for a little, the gloom which hung over their<br>guilty minds. The kind treatment of those who took an interest in their future wel-<br>fare. soothed their feelings and enabled them to look forward to that future state of<br>being, where the most guilty sinner, through deep and genuine repentance, will be<br>received as a welcome guest. With such a hope they are now cheered ; with such a<br>hope they are now ready to die ; and the few short days of time, appear to them as<br>nothing when Compared to that vast eternity, to which they are invited, through the<br>hope of the gospel, to anticipate happiness.<p>W. Carse, Printer, Glasgow.</p>
