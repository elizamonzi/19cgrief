	<p> The Mother of Jealousie<br>OR<br>The Husband's Lament, that he should part with his Wife by Reason of her<br>Jealousy of him.<br>To the Tune of Wo's my Heart that we should sinder.<p><br>When my dearest Dear did first appear,<br>I bless'd the time that I had found her:<br>Her Beauty did my Heart inchear,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>But now alas we two must sinder!<p>Her lovely Person pierc'd my Heart,<br>For truly there were none beyond her.<br>But now great Grief doth make me smart<br>To think my Dear and I most sinder.<p>My raging Mind could never rest,<br>Till I in Marriage-Bonds had join'd her;<br>But now with Grief I'm sore opprest,<br>To think my Dear and I must sinder.<p>I lov'd her well, she lov'd me once;<br>But I thought still she should be kinder:<br>But wo be to false Jealousie,<br>Which makes my Dear and me to sinder!<p>O falsly often she judg'd me,<br>And all my Power could not her hinder!<br>But God himself doth know I'm free,<br>But yet alas! we two must sinder.<p>O wo be to that wretched Fate,<br>For all our Pleasures thou didst hinder,<br>And thou twixt us two made Debate<br>Which caus'd us doolfully to sinder!<p>So that if I'd the World wide<br>And all that is the Heav'ns under,<br>I would give all for my Abode,<br>But all's in vain, for we must sinder.<p>Alas that Nothing can prevail,<br>Or yet my Journey none can hinder!<br>This sad Parting I cannot feel,<br>And wo's my heart that we should sinder!<p>My Love to her it was most strong,<br>But Jealousie hath brought it under,<br>And in her Breast hath lurked long,<br>Which causeth us alas! to sinder.<p>For me on Earth there is no Rest,<br>For sad's the Gate I have to wander.<br>For if I stay I'm sore opprest,<br>And wo's my Heart that we should sinder!<p>My Children small me sore do grieve,<br>They are the Cause me long do hinder;<br>But yet alas! I must be gone,<br>I'm glad to die before we sinder.<p>Oh now if that my lovely Wife,<br>Would unto me become yet kinder<br>And let not Jealousie make Strife!<br>I think it might my Journey hinder.<p>Alas there is no help for me!<br>But from all Pleasures I must wander.<br>My Dear she will have no Pity,<br>Alas no Help but we must sinder!<p>Lord, be a Husband to my dear Wife,<br>And a Father to my Children kinder,<br>Than ever I could been in Life.<br>Farewel, my Dear, for we must sinder.<p>FINIS.</p>
