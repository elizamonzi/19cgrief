	<p> Execution.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  <p>Account  of the Execution and  Behavior on  the Scaffold and&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>since his Sentence, of WILLM.  DIVAN, who suffered<br>at Glasgow on Wednesday the 21st July 1824 , for the&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  <br>Murder of his own Wife, Mary Jamieson, in  Paisley Loan,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  <br>Gorbals, on the 6th day of April last by cutting her throat,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>and his body given for dissection.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<p>Glasgow, 21st July,1824 ?This day the above unfortunate man  forfeited his<br>life for the murder of Mary Jamieson, his wife, in  Paisley Loan, Gorbals on the<br>6th day of April last .&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The woman was found  dead by two of her own children,<br>with her throat cut, when they came  home to their dinner , who then  gave the alarm,<br>and the police soon arrived and  searched the house ,but found nothing missing,<br>so that  plunder was not the object ; neither could it be from the ill will of any of<br>her neighbours,as she lived on the most friendly terms with them, and way loved  <br>by all who knew her, for kindly diposition , and for the careful manner with<br>which she managed her domastic concerns , especially her children.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We belive,<br>(though the prisoner has all along denied the commision of the horrid deed) that <br>he was really the guilty person . There is not an individual who read the tried,  <br>but will be as fully convinced as the Judge and Jury of the fairness of the verdict&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>which  was pronounced against him, and on the  issue of which being made known<br>to the prisoner , and after the Lord Justice clerk had addressed him in these<br>words ; ("his days were numbered ; he had cruelty bereft his wife of life , whom he<br>cught to have protected and cherished ; you stand this day at  the bar another<br>awful example that " murder will net hide; '' he then baseeched him to lumble<br>himself before God , whose laws he had so most grievously offended- mercy he had <br>none ,and none he could expect on earth ,but may God have mercy&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;upon his  <br>immortal soul ;)'' even after this solemn address,  and all the advanteges of a fair <br>trial conducted by upright Judges and a respectable Jury ,who would undoubtedly<br>look to the side of mercy ,were the least doubt remaining of his guilt,  the prisoner <br>on his bended knees , and in the presence of that God before whom he was soon to&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  <br>appear ,solemnly protests his innocence of the crime for which he is to  suffer.-<br>Such an apeal as this ,made by a person on the brink of eternity , and knowing  <br>himself to be actually guilty ,fills us  with horror ,and makes usshudder at the idea&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  <br>of a man going to the just tribunal of God with a lie in his right hand.<p>Since his condemnation he has been assisted in his devotional exercises by two<br>of the Ministers of the Church of Rome, the Rev.  Messrs.  Scott and Murdoch of <br>Glasgow, who visited  him frequintly, and paid every attention to his comfort and<br>edification.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He was  also attended by them in his cell on the day of execution,<br>(the difference in the forms of worshipe rendering the usual solemnities in the Hats<br>unnecessary ), and from that to the scaffold, which he asceaded  in a very becoming <br>manner, and after spending a few moments on the fatal drop in commussion with<br>his conscience and  his God, he gave the signal, and after a few convulsive pangs<br>he was ushered into that state where the secrets of the heart are naked and open <br>to Him with whom he has to do -After being suspended for about 35 minutes,<br>his body was cut down , and convyed in a coffin, and under a military escort , to<br>Dr. Jeffray, proffesser  of Anatomy in Glagow , to be publicly dissected. -He was <br>decently dressed, and was about 47 years of age -He originally belonged to the <br>country of Donegal, Ireland but has been in this country  upwards of 30 years,<br>a number of which he has spent in the Gorbals of Glasgow, and resided at the time <br>of commiting the dead in Paisley Loan. He was some time a weaver, but latierly<br>sold fish along with his wife apon the streets.  She also belonged to Ireland.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By <br>this horrid business, three children have been deprived of their parents, an awful<br>lesson to every person to beware of hasty passion, bad company, and every thing<br>that would in any, way , lead them from  the paths of honest industry , or that would<br>tempt them to gratify their desires at the expense of the life of a fellow creature,<br>and especially, of any one whom they are bound by the most endearing ties to pro-<br>tect and watch over.?He was tried at Edinburgh, on the 14th June; was sent<br>back here on the 21st of the same, to undergo the sentence passed upon him, which&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>was put in force this day, the 21st July, 1824.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;W. Carse, Printer, Glasgow.</p>
