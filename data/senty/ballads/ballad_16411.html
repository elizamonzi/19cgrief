	<p> FOUND.<p>The public are informed that a telegram was received this morning,<br>at three o'clock in the afternoon, by a friend of the<p>YOUNG&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;MAN<p>who has been long missing from the neighbourhood of the High Street,<br>stating that he has been found by the City Police of a rural district<br>called Old Manconium, which is situated at the foot of the Underground<br>Mountains, on the south side of the Equator, and near to the North Pole.<p>It appears that he left the town on the 3rd of next month by means<br>of a fast train on the underground railway that commences at Boggart<br>Hoile Clough, and which is known only to a few of a certain class. He<br>was directed to it by a tall, black man, dressed in the height of fashion,<br>whose uniform bore on the right arm the following device : ?A Cloven<br>Foot surmounted by a Pitchfork and a pair of Horns. On arriving at<br>the station he found all the porters, guards, &c., wore the same uniform,<br>and bore the same device as his conductor, and learned that the Company<br>was called the Pandemonium Line. When the train started! he was<br>surprised at the speed at which they travelled, finding next morning<br>he was 4000 miles on his journey, and they went through the Suez<br>Canal at a fearful rate. On arriving at the Mount Cenis Tunnel he<br>had to take a screw steamer, which, when only half-way through, the<br>tunnel, drew so much water that she began to sink; to lighten her a<br>few thousand Communists were thrown overboard, who are supposed<br>to be the same that have caused the hubbub in Paris. In passing<br>through the scene of Dr Livingstone's explorations he met with that<br>celebrated traveller, who was glad to see him, and entertained him for<br>several days, promising to be home to tea on the 34th of July next,<br>after Tib's Eve. Bidding good-bye to the doctor, he arrived at Ice<br>Bergs, in the vicinity of the North Pole, where the intence cold melted<br>his cast-iron trimmings. To sustain life in this  region he was obliged<br>to shoot large numbers of white bears, melt them on icebergs, eat of<br>their flesh, and drink their oil in quarts. This food not agreeing with<br>him, he was obliged to eat the sausage stripes from his trousers, the<br>mutton cutlets from his waistcoat, also the tripe collar that adorned<br>his double-barrelled coat.<p>In the months he was absent he found that he had lost in weight,<br>of flesh, no less than 74 inches avordupois round the calve of his legs ;<br>and, on referring to a looking-glass, he found his tall complexion was<br>much altered?his face being tatooed with the bites of mosquitoes (which<br>were very numerous, in consequence of the intense cold) ; and his nose<br>the colour of a red-hot poker through drinking so much foreign London<br>gin, which is distilled by the natives of that country in immense<br>quantities.<p>It is made from the gills of pickled gorillas, wild porcupines, and<br>other insects which abound in that quarter.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<p>He declared before the Magistrates that he was a true Briton, and<br>ho would fast all the days of Lent before he would eat their vile and<br>horrid stuff.<p>It was surprising how he could fast every day, from 12 o'clock at<br>night till 8 in the morning, without eating anything at all.<p>P.S.?His relations are hereby informed that he is now well treated,<br>boarded, and lodged, and that he will be delivered safely to them on<br>payment of the unnecessary expenses ; the said expenses being incurred<br>by the printing of bills, and by his rending and destroying every one<br>of the twenty straight jackets, with which he has been accommodated<br>during his imprisonment.<p>L. Macartney, The Poet's Box, 184 Overgate, Dundee.</p>
