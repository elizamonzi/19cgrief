	<h2>Transcription</h2>
	<p> A particular account of the Trial and Sentence of ROBERT<br>SCOTT, the; Edinburgh Carrier to Earlstoun, who is to be<br>Executed at the spot where he committed the horrid deed,<br>on Wednesday, 29th October, 1823, for the barbarous murder<br>of James Aitchison, cooper, and Robert Sim, horse-dealer,<br>Greenlaw, on the road near Earlston, and who, after he had<br>effected his horrid design, cut off their noses and put them in<br>their mouths, with an account of his dreadful behaviour before<br>the Court; his body is to be sent to Edinburgh for dissection.<p>On Tuesday the 16th September, 1823, came on before the Circuit Court of Justi-<br>ciary at Jedburgh, the trial of ROBERT SCOTT, late carrier betwixt Edinburgh and<br>Earlstoun, accused of murdering James Aitchison, cooper in Greenlaw, and Robert<br>him, horse-dealer there, and did, with a sheep-stake, or bludgeon, or stone, or some<br>other lethal weapon, to the prosecutor unknown, cruelly and barbarously inflict vari-<br>ous severe blows and wounds upon the persons of the above persons; whereby the head<br>and left leg of the latter were fractured and broken, and the head of the former was<br>severely wounded ; and did, likewise with a knife, or other sharp instrument, to the<br>prosecutor unknown, in a cruel and barbarous manner, cut and slit the noses of the<br>aid persons, in consequence of all which they were bereaved of life.<p>To which the prisoner replied, " No, my Lord, they attacked me, and I am Not<br>Guilty," and bowed respectfully.<p>Scott was removed on the 15th September from Greenlaw Jail to Jedburgh. When<br>near Kelso, a great number went out to meet them and behaved outrageously to the<br>prisoner, crying out, " Hang him, &c." They arrived at Jedburgh about 4 o'clock.<br>A great crowd left Jedburgh to meet him, who could scarcely refrain from rescuing<br>him from the military, and tearing him in pieces.<p>Witnesses were then called, the two first of whom proved that the deceased and the<br>prisoner had been quarrelling on the road, and that the prisoner's face was bleeding.<br>The third witness James Waldie, deponed?I was at Earlstoun Fair, and on my road<br>some overtook the prisoner about eight in the evening. . Broomfield and Stark were<br>near him, end so were Sim and Aitcheson, and some others. The prisoner told me<br>hat Sim and Aitcheson had been abusing him. I went on with Stark and Bloomfield.<br>I observed Sim and Aitcheson washing the prisoner's face at a well, but saw no more<br>of them till they came to my own house. The prisoner wanted him to take Sim into<br>custody, but I said I had no authority to do so, and advised them to go home good<br>friends. Sim and Aitchison walked away after shaking hands with me. The prisoner<br>left a bundle with me and then went away. I observed him attempt to pull a spar off<br>a gate, but did not succeed. About eleven o'clock, Andrew Robertson told me that<br>one man had been killed on the moor, and another was fast dying. I got assistants,<br>and went to Lightfield, where they were removed.<p>After the examination of a number of other witnesses, whose evidence was quite<br>convincing, Lord Pitmilly summed up the evidence in a most impartial manner, and<br>the jury in eight minutes returned a verdict of guilty. Next day, sentence was passed<br>against him, which was, " that he be executed at the place most convenient near the<br>spot where the murders were committed, on Wednesday the 29th of October, and his<br>body given to Dr Monro for dissection.<p>The prisoner was not the least moved with his awful situation, but in a bold man-<br>ner, and with an audible voice, said, " They might make pye-meat of his flesh, and<br>whistles of his bones for any thing he cared, when his life was gone."<p>Some accounts say that he actually cut the noses off the faces of Sim and Aitche-<br>son, and put them in their mouth, but we would fain hope, for the honour of Scotland,<br>that this account is overcharged.<p>J. G. Lockhart, Esq. advocate, was counsel for Scott.?Lerd Minto and another<br>Nobleman were on the Bench.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There were 26 witnesses for the prosecution.<br>Scott is a tall dark man, very gloomy in his appearance.<p>W. Carse, Printer, Glasgow.</p>
