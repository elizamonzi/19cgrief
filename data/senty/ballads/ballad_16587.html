	<p> CONFESSIONS <p>OF<p>John Stewart<p>An account of the different Murders to which John Stewart<br>and his female associate has made confession to since<br>their condemnation, making Eleven in all, with the<br>names of the places where some of them were committed<br>with the manner they took to Murder their victims, and<br>then rob them.<p>Taken from the Edinburgh Scotsman, and Caledonian Mercury.<p>Stewart and his female associate, who received sentence of death on<br>Tuesday, for the Murder of Robert Lamont, on board the Toward Cas-<br>tle steam boat, on the river Clyde, in the  month of December last, ap-<br>pear to be monsters of iniquity worthy of being classed with the incar-<br>nate demons of the West Port. Even before his trial, Stewart admitted<br>to some persons who had access to him that he done (murdered) seven<br>persons besides Lamont, by administering to them what he called in his<br>infamous slang, the doctor, that is by poisoning them with laudanum. and<br>since his conviction. he has Confessed to three more murders, making<br>eleven in all. Now if this be true which we are inclined to believe<br>it is, it exhibits a woeful picture of the inafficacy of our criminal law,<br>and of the fearful amount of chances of escspe, which it affords even to<br>the most hardened and daring offenders; for by this statement, ten<br>mortal murders were committed not only with impunity, but without<br>the fact of their having been committed at all, being known or even<br>suspected by those whose duty it is to detect and punish crimes.<p>Is it any answer to say, "Oh, it is. quite true that any man may commit eleven murders like<br>Stewart, or sixteen like Burke, but it is quite  certain he will be at last detected and hanged<br>Our very ground of complaint is founded upon the fact of these monsters not being detected<br>sooner, and this will never happen until we have the sense, or it would be more correct to<br>say the humanity, to borrow from our neighbours their invaluable institution of a Coroner's<br>Inquest, which might easily be adapted to and engrafted upon our own institutions.<p>We know from good authority, that eight other murders, committed by the same or similar<br>means, have been traced home to him, in a manner that leaves no doubt of his guilt, and in<br>the list is included one which it may be remembered was perpetrated  several years ago,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;in<br>an unfinished  buildiug near Maitland street. The presumption is too, that this is but an<br>imperfect catalogue of his most atrocious acts; and if he administered the deleterious drug,<br>" the doctor," as he called it in so many cases with fatal effect, we may readily believe that<br>he gave it in many others in smaller proportions, where his object was merely to produce a<br>temporary stupefaction.  The dispute and scuffle betwixt Stewart and his wife, when he made<br>an attempt as if he meant to drink the poisoned ale, and she wrung it from him,  calling him<br>a blackguard, and saying he would fill himself drunk?with his assuming an appear ance of<br>intoxication  afterward were just in the style of Burke and Here when they got up a sham<br>quarrel, preparatory to the imoulation of their victim. It is to be hoped that the facts of the<br>other murders we have alluded to will be published; although it should serve no other pur-<br>pose than to impress upon persons of the lower and middle ranks, the danger to which men<br>are exposed by their passion for intoxicating liquours.<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Carmichael & Graham, Printer,Trongate.</p>
