	<p> FIRE.<p>An account of that dreadful and destructive Fire that<br>took place in Leith this morning, when the enten-<br>sive Steam Mills on the Shore were burned to the<br>ground, besides a number of other houses and pro-<br>perty amounting to about £30,000, besides a num-<br>ber of persons severely hurt.? The particulars cor--<br>rectly given by an eye witness.<p>DREADFUL AND  DESTRUCTIVE&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; FIRE&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; IN&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;LEITH.?------<p>This morning about three o'clock, those extensive pre-<br>mises situated at the back of those leading up the Broad<br>Wynd, lately built for the purpose of meal steam mills,<br>took fire,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  A&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;short&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;time after&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the conflagration was<br>discovered, the Leith and Battery engines were prompt-<br>ly on  the spot, and&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a terwards a numqer of  engines<br>from Edinburgh, under the  direction of Mr Paterson.<br>So dreadful did the  fire rage, that although these en-<br>gines&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;were  plentifully supplied with&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;water and ably<br>managed, yet it was found impracticable to entinguish<br>the raging element until  the whole range of buildings<br>were burned to the ground. It is impossible to describe<br>the terrific yet grand, we may even  say sublime effect<br>that the flames, while they burst at  intervals in large<br>columns, had upon the surface of the sea, while fleaks<br>of burning embers threatened destruction to the build-<br>ings around.<p>The following, account of this destructive  conflagration. is given in  <p>a  letter by an eye witness,<p>About midnight I was alarmed by a bright light in<br>my bedroom, and on getting Up, I perceived from the<br>window as if the whole buildings on the Shore were in<br>ftames. On getting out I found that those extensive<br>steam mills occupied by Messrs George Goodlet &;Co.<br>were in a blaze. The engines belonging to Leith and<br>the Artillery Fort were alertly on the spot, and were<br>assisted shortly after by a number of powerful engines<br>from Edinburgh; but so rapid did the fire make ground,<br>that it was out of the power of mortal exertions to keep<br>it down. About 4 o'clock nearly the whole of the in-<br>habitants were turned out, who stood motionless, gaz-<br>ing with fear and anxie y at the sublime and terrible<br>elevastation going on. The tide was nearly ful, and the morning<br>dark, which made the sp ctacle truly magnificient and awful. The<br>reflection of the flames upon the sea, which sparkled at every wave,<br>nad a very imposing effct. By 6 o'clock the flames were seen<br>bursting from every window, of which there are are several hund-<br>reds in the premises, which are s ven stories high. Shortly after<br>the flames commmunicated with the east side of the Broad Wynd,<br>which has comminted considerable devastation, and is not yet (10<br>o' clock) extinguished.<p>Several men engaged&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;in extinguishing the fire  were hurt by the<br>falling of the ruins,and it is said that one man was  killed.<br>Besides the total destruation of the mills, those extensive premises in<br>St Bernard Street, belonging.to Messrs Atichison and Company, were<br>merchants, were consumed to the ground.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I am happy to say they are insured.<p>This forenoon nothing but the are walls of the mills were to be<br>seen, part of which to the south has fallen in, and great fears are en-<br>tertained that the chimney stalk, which is  of considerable bright,.<br>will come down.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <p>Forbes & Co,Printers, 171, Cowgate,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
