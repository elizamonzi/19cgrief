	<p> The late Duel. <p>Trial of Mr STUART of Dunearn, for the late Duel, in which Sir<br>ALEXANDER BOS WELL, of Auchinleck, lost his life, which<br>came on at Edinburgh on Monday last, the 10th June, 1822.,<br>with an account of its final result.<p>High Court of Justiciary, 10th June, 1822.?This day, at ten o'clock, Mr Stuart enter<br>ed the Court by way of the Judges' Robing Room, it being impossible for him to gain ad-<br>mittance any other way, owing to the passages being completely chocked up. He was ac-<br>companied by the Earl of Moray, Admiral Fleming, Captain Gordon, and David Erskine,<br>Esq. and son, of Cardross. Several of Mr Stuart's particular friends, who were advocates.<br>had previously taken their seats; among these was Mr Ferguson of Baith,?A number of<br>nobility were accommodated with seats on the bench, among whom was Prince Czarto-<br>rinski. The Solicitor-General entered the Court a little after ten, and a little time after,<br>the Lord Advocate entered. The other Crown Counsel were, R. Dundas, Esq. D. M'Neill,<br>Esq. ? Menzies, Esq.<p>Their Lordships took their seats precisely at half-past ten.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Present, the Lord Justice<br>Clerk. Lord Hermand, Lord Gillies, Lord Pitmilly, and Lord Succoth. The Clerk having<br>read the indictment, the  Lord Justice Clerk  demanded of the accused his plea to the<br>charge contained therein.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Stuart, in an audible voice, " My Lord, I am not guilty."<p>After a long speech by Mr Cockburn with regard to the relevancy of the indictment, in<br>which several clauses were not dwelt upon, the following individuals  were appointed to&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>constitute a jury:?&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<p>Thomas Adinston of Carcant; William Pagan of Linburn ; John Wauchope of Edmon-<br>stone ; Sir Alexander Charles Maitland Gibson of Cliftonhall,  Bart. ; Sir John Hope of&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>Craighall, Bart ; James Watson of Saughton ; James Haig of Lochrin ; John Thomson<br>of Burnhouse; Iohn Anderson of Whitburgh ; Sir James Dalyell Bart, of Binns ; James&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>Dundas of Dundas ;  David Brown, clothler in Edinburgh ;  Robert Paterson, ironmonger<br>there; Thomas M'Ritchie, wine merchant, Leith ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;William Telfer, merchant there.<p>After the examination of witnesses, the jury consulted for a few minutes in the box,<br>when Sir John Hope, their Chancellor, delivered a unanimous verdict of?NOT GUILTY.<p>The verdict was received with loud cheers from without the doors, and with marked<br>approbation from within.<p>The trial lasted eighteen hours, and was not finished till near five next morning. The<br>Court continued crowded during the whole time.<p>When Mr Cockburn alluded in his speech to the fatal end of Sir A. Boswell, Mr Stuart<br>burst into tears.<p>Counsel for the accused, Francis Jeffrey, H. Cockburn, J. Moncrieff and T. Maitland,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>Esqrs.<p>It is impossible to conceive the interest which this, trial excited throughout the city.<br>The doors were crowded as early as seven in the morning, and before they were opened the<br>Parliament Square was almost filled with people.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Great tumult was occasioned by the re-<br>sistance given to the police in their attempt to clear the doors, so much so that they were <br>often induced to use considerable violence.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The scene, in short, was almost unparalelled<br>in the whole history of the trials which have taken place.<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;W. Carse, Printer, Glasgow.</p>
