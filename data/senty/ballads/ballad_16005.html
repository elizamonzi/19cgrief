	<p> A particular account of a Barbarous, Cruel, and Inhuman<p>MURDER&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  <p>Committed on the Body of William Brown, Cadie in  Edinburgh;<p>by his own wife, Isobell Smith on the night of the 3d Sept. 1792.<p>MURDER is a heinous crime and<br>severly punishable in any circum-<br>stance, but more especially when<br>committed by a Husband upon<br>the body of his lawful Wife, whom he is bound<br>to guard and protect both by the ties of nature<br>and all laws humane and divine.  This crime<br>can only be exceeded, when what is still more<br>unatural! the wife rises up against the life of<br>her husband! What can we suppose more un-<br>natural, than a woman who has been long de-<br>pendant upon the labour of her husband, for<br>her daily support, and in all her troubles, and<br>adversities still proved her friend and guardi-<br>an to protect her from  every  violence,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the<br>man to whom she only could unsold&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;her se-<br>cret thought, and  confide in as  her only<br>friend? <p>It certainly must be the height of cruelty,<br>As well as the most depraved wickedness in<br>her who can be guilty of such an abominable<p>crime, as to lift up her hand against the life<p>of her husband.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are I believe Fewer<p>examples of this kind of murder upon record,<p>than that of any other species, and where it<p>does occur it certainly ought to be punished<p>in an examplary manner, in order to stop the<p>further progress of such an unnatural crime<p>For this reason in the English code of laws it<p>is enacted, that this crime is stiled high Trea-<p>son, and wherever it is found proven,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to<p>be punished as such; and the culprit is strang<p>led and, burned at the common place of exe-<p>cution, in order to show the heinousness of<p>this crime above other crimes, which are de-<p>noted (Felony and Murder) altho' they are<p>capitally punished;  yet they are not exposed<p>to such ignominy as this:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  <p>In the case before us there are several in-<br>stances of aggrevations of this crime, in the<br>first place, there was neither youth nor inex-<br>perience to plead, she being 45 years of age<br>the culprit who gave rise to this, Isabel<br>Smith, Wife of the deceased William Brown<br>Cadie in Edinburgh; who lived opposite the<br>foot of Steven law's Closs in the Cowgate, it<br>was on Monday evening the 3d. of September<br>1792, that the neighbours heard her quarrel-<br>ing with her husband the said William Brown,<br>who was an old infirm man about 75 years of<br>age, as they had often heard them quarrel<br>before, they took little thought of the dread-<br>ful consequences although they heard as it<br>were the noise of several blows, they took no<p>suspicion she would strike the old man in such<br>an unmerciful manner, but alas! Tuesday<br>presented a melancholy scence, for poor old<br>William was found dead upon his bed, with<br>several marks of severe blows he had receiv-<br>ed upon his head and other parts of his body.<br>AS no other person was in  the house,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;they<br>immediately laid hold of Isobel, and took her<br>before the sitting Magistrate, where the guilt<br>appearing by the evidence of the Neighbours<br>and the evidence of two Surgeons who  were<br>sent to inspect the body, they both gave their<br>opinions that his death  had been occasioned<br>by the voilent blows  he had received; by all<br>Which it appeared to the Magistrat, that she <br>had been guilty of comitting this cruel mur-<br>der, and she was committed to Endinburgh<br>Jail in order to stand her trial before the High<br>Court of justiciary for the same.<br> Here we cannot but pause and wonder at<br>the wickedness of mankind! What could pro-<br>voke her to murder the poor old infirm man<br>is past my ceonception; unless she has been<br>so wicked as to suppose, that now she had no<br>right to use any diligence or industry to sup-<br>port him, now that he was old and not able<br>to work for her, and that the allowance he<br>had from the Cadies Box was not sufficent to<br>support him, and therefore she could live bet-<br>ter without him, at any rate, it must have<br>been some horrid instigation of Satan work-<br>ing upon her wicked heart, that could tempt<br>her to the commission of such a horrid and<br>unnatural crime; Satan has nothing more to<br>desire of us than that we should throw off the<br>fear of the Lord, and contrive means to make<br>ourselves happy in this world regardless of<br>the world to come; we then come effectually<br>under his dominion, and he hurries on from<br>the commission of small crimes until greater,<br>until at last we are compleately ruined, soul<br>and body.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let us therefore who yet stand<br>take care left we fall; let us be insta[] at all<br>seasons at the throne of grace, that the Al-<br>mighty may never leave us to ourselves so far<br>as that Satan may gain any dominion over us,<br>and let us live soberly and  honestly in this<br>present world.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, let us lay up treasure  <br>in heaven, where neither moth nor rust doth<br>corrupt, neither us  thievs break through<br>and steal; and let us remember, that neither<br>whoremongers, nor murderers, nor adulter-<br>ers, shall enter into the kingdom of God.</p>
