	<p> Trial and Sentence.<p><p>A full true and particular account of the Trial and Sentence of<br>William Gilchrist, George Gilchrist, and James Brown, who were<br>tried before the High Court of Justiciary on Wednesday 13th<br>July, on a charge of abstracting a box from the Prince Regent<br>coach from Glasgow to Edinburgh, containing L.5712 6s. on the<br>24th March last, when George Gilchrist was sentenced to be<br>executed on the 3d of August next?William Gilchrist and Brown<br>were dismissed from the bar.<p>Yesterday, Wednesday 13th July 1831, came on before the High<br>Court of Justiciary the trial of William Gilchrist, Ceorge Gilchrist,<br>and James Brown, charged with having abstracted from a box in<br>the Prince Regent coach from Glasgow to Edinburgh, on the 24rh<br>March last, £5712 6s. belonging to the.Commercial Banking Com-<br>pany. The prisoners pleaded Not Guilty.<p>It would be impossible to give even an outline of the evidence, it<br>so voluminous. Mr P. Robertson objected to four witnesses as not<br>being properly designated, after which the Sheriff of Lanark-shire,<br>and the Fiscal for Glasgow, gave evidence as to the robbery, and<br>the examination of the panels. The agent of the Commercial Bank<br>Campbelton stated the amount of specie sent from there to the agent<br>at Glasgow, in the bank box, which consisted 294 sovereigns, and<br>six guineas, in gold, and L.100 in silver,'all of which was safely re-<br>ceived at Glasgow. Mr Lorrain, teller, said he remembered having<br>delivered the bank box to the Porter on the 24th March last, to be<br>sent to Edinburgh, which contained L.5712 6s. in gold and notes.<br>Smith, the porter, deponed that he chained the box in the Prince<br>Regent coach, and booked it. M'Dowal, coachman, drove the coach<br>to Airdrie, where he was met by M'Millan, another coachman, who<br>drove the coach to Edinburgh, and deponed that the boot, in which<br>the box was chained, was untouched at that place.<p>Mr Millan deponed to finding the coach broke at Bathgate, where<br>he opened the boot to take out a parcel, and said to Mr Ross some-<br>thing must be wrong, but there were no inside passengers. The<br>ony inside passengers from Glasgow to Edinburgh, were a man<br>and woman, who were taken up at the junction of the roads by<br>M'Dowal, and who were let out about a mile and a half past Air-<br>drie, though there were six marked in the way-bill. Mr Ross, at<br>Uphall, corroborated the last witness, and stated, that on looking<br>into the inside of the coach, he found several parcels addressed to<br>the Commercial Bank scattered about, when the coachman exclaim-<br>ed, " Good God, will the bank box be away ?"<p>Fndlay, the porter of the bank at Edinburgh, attended the coach<br>office, as usual, for the box, got it, but found nothing in it ; after<br>which, James Morrison, innkeeper at Falkirk, who was admitted<br>King's evidence, detailed the circumstances of the robbery at great<br>length, with much reluctanee, and after being repeatedly warned by<br>the Court of his dangerous situation. He  was followed by another,<br>socious criminus, Thomas Campbell, joiner in Mid-Calder, who also<br>deponed, at great  length, what he knew of the case. His testimony<br>was followed by that of another accomplice's, Robert Simpson,<br>cooper in Falkirk, who described fully the circumstances of the<br>robbery, being in the coach with George Gilchrist, who was dress-<br>ed as a woman, and who, with a centre-bit and chissel, broke through<br>to the boot, and pressed open the box, when the money was taken<br>away.<p>After the examination of several other witnesses, who clearly<br>proved the whole history of the case, in every particular the prison-<br>ers declarations were read ; when their counsel proceeded to bring<br>forward their exculpatory evidence, one hundred witnesses having<br>been cited, which occupied the Court a very long time.<p>After which the Jury were addressed agianst and for the prison-<br>ers at great length, when the Lord Justice Clerk, in his usual im-<br>partial and comprehensive manner, summed up the evidence. The<br>Jury then retired, and in a short time returned a verdict, finding<br>the eldest Gilchrist guilty, and James Brown and William Gilchrist<br>not guilty. After a most imdressive address from the Lord Justice<br>Clerk, George Gilchrist was sentenced to be executed here on Wed-<br>nesday morning the 3d of August next. This trial excited very<br>great interest, and lasted upwards of twenty-six hours.<p><br>Printed for Murdoch M'Rae, Price One Halfpenny.</p>
