	<p> The Isle<p>OF<p>FRANCE.<p>The sun was fair the clouds advanced,<br>When a convict came to the Isle of France,<br>Around his leg he wore a ring and chain,<br>And his country was of the Shamrock green.<p>Then the coast-guard waited all on the beach,<br>Till the convict's boat was in the reach,<br>The convict's chains did so shire and spark,<br>Which opened the viens of the caust-guard's heart.<p>Then the coast-guard launced his little boat,<br>Upon the ocean with him to float;<br>The birds at night, take their silent, rest,<br>But the convict, here has a wounded breast.<p>Then the coast-guard came to the Isle of France,<br>Towards him the convict did advance,<br>When the tears from his eyes did fall like rain,<br>Young man I hear you're of the Shamrock green.<p>I am a Shamrock, the convict cried,<br>That has been tossed on the ocean wide,<br>For being unruly I do declare,<br>I was doomed to transport for seven years.<p>When six of them were past and gone,<br>We were coming home to make up one,<br>When the stormy winds did blow and roar,<br>Which cast me here on a foreign shore.<p>Then the coast-guard played a noble part,<br>With some brandy he cheered the convict's heart,<br>Altho' the night is so far advanced.<br>You shall find a friend in the Isle of France.<p>Then a speedy letter went to the Queen,<br>About the dreadful shipwreck of the Shamrock green<br>Then his freedom came by a speedy post,<br>To the absent convict they thought was lost.<p>God bless the coast-guard, the convict cried,<br>You have saved my life from the ocean wide,<br>I will drink his health in a flowing glass,<br>So here's success to the Isle of France.<p>HOME RULE<p>FOR<p>IRELAND.<p>Come all you sons of Erin,<br>Who love your native soil;<br>I claim your kind attention,<br>Just for a little while;<br>Come and join the Home Rule movement,<br>Irishmen on every hand,<br>And very soon we'll have Home Rule<br>In poor Old Ireland.<p>We've got some noble heroes,<br>To advocate our cause,<br>And we know that Ireland is oppress'd<br>By cruel English laws.<br>There's Mr. Butt, our noble chief,<br>Determined aye to stand,<br>And do his best to free the sons<br>Of poor Old Ireland.<p>There's John Martin, Sir G. Bowyer,<br>There's Sullivan and Shee,<br>Dr. Cummins, Galbraith, and many more<br>Who one and all agree,<br>That England has no right to rule<br>Or govern Erin's shore ,<br>Let Irishmen make Irish laws,<br>And they'll ask for nothing more.<p>There's Gladstone', the late Prime Minister<br>Who the Irish Church Bill planned,<br>Thinking that it would satisfy<br>The sons of Paddy's land ;<br>But Paddy wants to rule himself,<br>And be free from all his foes,<br>Then the sun of happiness would shine<br>Where the little shamrock grows.<p>The Americans and Frenchmen<br>All sympathise, and say<br>That Ireland should have Home Rule,<br>And hope to see the day,<br>When Ireland as a nation,<br>Will be powerful and free,<br>And in the full enjoyment<br>Of Home Rule and Liberty.<p>Long life to Butt! he's worthy of<br>All Irishman's applause,<br>Like noble Dan that's dead and gone,<br>His heart lies in our cause<br>In the British House of Commons,<br>Mr. Butt and his noble band<br>Will struggle hard for Home Rule,<br>And the rights of Ireland.<p></p>
