	<p> Correct Account of&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <p>THE RIOTS&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<p>Conerning Stealing Dead Bodies,  in  different parts of Grlasgow<br>On Saturday and Sunday, the&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1st and 2d March,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1823; with&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;an aceount of<br>the Dead Bodies, and the Heads Limbs & pieces of Human Bodies Found.<p>Early&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;on  Friday  night.  the neighbonrhood of the College<br>Church-yard, was alarmed by noises proceeding from the church,<br>yard, when the watchman on that station  sprung his  rattle, and<br>having procured assistance, they entered the graye-yard,  where<br>they found three doctors and a boy,  whom  they escorted to the<br>Police Office,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <p>In the middle of the above night, the watchman at Lady-well<br>street remarked two well dressed persons hastening toward the<br>High Church-yard&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An interyal of some  minutes elapsed, when<br>he perceived the same  persons return,  followed by some others <br>bearing  something tied up in  a large bundle.? An alarm was<br>instantly given, when the watchmen assembled, and  having se-<br>cured the man who was bearing the bundle, and a young. man<br>who appeared of the same party, they then proceeded to examine <br>the bundle;  which was found to be the&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;body of a man deceased,<br>who had lived in the Havannah, and who was lately interred in<br>the aforesa id&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;church  yard.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The fellow that carried the corpse<br>made such oppositions to his being taken, by striking. kicking, and<br>biting the watchmen, that they thought proper to bind him and the<br>corpse together, on a hurley, when they were removed to the Of-<br>fice.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It was&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;with&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;great difficulty the police could prevent the<br>crowd that. assembled from taking vengeance on-him.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The son of<br>the man disinterred, appeared at the Office some time afterwards,<br>to claim his father's body,<p>Drawing conclusions from those and other events, it was that a great concourse<br>of people assembled opposite a  lecture room in Duke street, on Saturday<br>morning, at half past nine o' clock, when they proceeded to break open the<br>door, when a most appalling scene presented itself....On the floor, stood a large<br>tub, in which was found a number of heads, arms and legs. On the table lay<br>the whole body of a woman with long hair. The body of a man lay aside it.<br>with the head cut off, and the entrrils out, and otherwise dissected. At the<br>end of the room was a complete skeleton. Other rhangled bodies were found,<br>and limbs and mutilated fragments of bodies were strewed about the room. The<br>mobs were so exasperated that, siezing the bodies and every thing found in the<br>room; they tossed them into the streets. They were proceeding to demolish<br>the premises until the arrival of Baillie Snell, with the Police, and a detachment<br>of  soldiers, when a proper guard was stationed to prevent farther violence,<p>Yesterday forennon; a crowd assembled an Portlaad street, at another lecture<br>room, when they had proceeded to break the other door, and were proceeding<br>to the room, when they were alarmed by the arrival of the Police. Some bones<br>were found on the premises, arid were tossed about by the crowd. Guards are<br>placed to prevent mischief while a legal investigation is going on, to satisfy the<br>public mind.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<p>Mayne & Co.</p>
