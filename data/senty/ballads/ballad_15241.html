	<p> The Last Speech of Sir GODFREY M'CULLOCH of Myretoun,<br>Knight and Baronet, who was Beheaded at the Cross of<br>Edinburgh, the Twenty Sixth day of March, 1697.<p>I Am brought here good People to give Satisfaction to Justice, for the<br>Slaughter of William Gordon designed of Cardines; And therefore I am<br>obliged as a dying Man, to give a Faithfull and True Account of that matter.<p>I do declare in the Sight of GOD, I had no design against his Life, nor<br>did  I expect  to see him, when I came where the Accident happened ; I came<br>there contrair to my Inclination, being pressed by these two Persons, who<br>were the Principal Wirnesses against me, ( they declaring he was not out of<br>Bed ) that I might relieve their Goods he had poinded; I do freely forgive<br>them, and I Pray heartily GOD  may forgive them, for bringing me to that<br>place.<p>When I was in England, I was of times urged by several Persons, who<br>declared they had Commission from Castle-Stewart and his Lady, (now the<br>Pursuers for my Blood ) that I might give up the Papers of these Lands of<br>Cardines, wherupon they promised not only a piece of Money, But also to<br>concurr for procuring me a Remission; And I have been several times since<br>in the Countrie, where the Misfortune happened, and where they lived, but<br>never troubled by any of them : Although now after they have got themselves<br>secured in these Lands without me, they have been very active in the Pur-<br>sute, untill at last they have got me brought to this place.<p>I do acknowledge my Sentence is Just, and does not Repine ; For albeit<br>it was only a single Wound in the Legg, by a shot of small Hail, which was<br>neither intended, nor could be foreseen to be deadly ; Yet I do believe, That<br>GOD in his Justice hath suffered me to fall in that miserable Accident , for<br>which I am now to suffer, because of my many other Great and Grievous<br>unrepented for Sins :  I do therefore heartily forgive my Judges, Accusers,<br>Witnesses, and all Others who have now, or at any time Injured me, as I<br>wish to be Foregiven.<p>I Recommend my Wife, and poor Children to the Protection of the Al-<br>mighty GOD, who doth take Care of , and Provides for the Widow and<br>Fatherless ; And Prayes, That GOD may Stirr up and Enable their Friends<br>and mine , to be Careful of them.<p>I have been Branded as being a Roman Catholick, which I altogether disown,<br>And Declare , as the Words of a Dying Man , who am instantly to make my<br>Appearance before the Great Tribunal of the Great GOD , That I die in the<br>True Catholick Reformed Protestant Religion , Renouncing all Righteoussness of<br>my own, or any Others ; Relying only upon the Merits of CHRIST JESUS,<br>through whose Blood , I hope to be Saved, And whom I Trust, will not only<br>be my Judge, But also, Advocate with the Father for my Redemption.<p>Now Dear Spectators , As my Last Request, Again and Again, I carnestly<br>Desire, and Begg, The Assistance of Your Fervent Prayers, That, Although<br>I stand here Condemned by Man , I may be Absolved before the Tribunal of<br>the Great GOD, That in place of this Scaffold I may enjoy a Throne of Glory ;<br>That this Violent Death may bring me to a Life of Glorious Rest , Eternal in<br>the Heavens : And that in place of all these Spectators, I may be Accom-<br>panyed with an Innumerable Company of Saints and Angels, Singing, Halle-<br>lujah to the Great KING to all Eternity.<p>New, 0 LORD, Remember me with that Love Thou bearest to Thy Own, O visite<br>me with Thy Salvation, that I may see the Good of Thy Chosen Ones, and may Glery<br>in Thine Inberitance, LORD JESUS Purge me from all my Sins, and from this<br>of  Blood Guiltiness, Wash we in Thy Own Blood. Great are mine Iniquities, But<br>Greater are the Mercies of GOD! 0 let me be amongst the number of those for whom<br>CHRIST dyed ; Be Then my Advocat with the Father, Into Thy bands do I recom-<br>mend my Spirit : Come, LORD JESUS Come, and receive my Soul, Amen.<p>Sic Subscribitur<br>Sir GODFREY M'CULLOCH.<p>Edinburgh, Printed by John Reid, and are to be sold at his Printing<br>House in Bells Wynd.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1697.</p>
