	<h2>Transcription</h2>
	<p> Genuine and latest Account of the Ex-<br>eution of John Campbell who suffered<br>at Stirling on Friday last, the 14th of<br>May 1824. shewing the Lamentable<br>manner in which he cried aloud  for<br>mercy, with an account of his affect-<br>ing farewell with his aged Father ;al-<br>so an account how be seized hold of<br>rope whan he was thrown off.<p>This day, the above unfortunate young man, John Campbell,<br>who was, on the 9th of April last, convicted of various acts<br>of Housebreaking and Theft, suffered the last punishment of<br>the law. His behaviour on the occasion of his trial, was of<br>such an uncommon and extravagant nature,?breaking out<br>into the most heart-rending lamentation,18 and otherwise ex-<br>hibiting such a want of fortitude,?that many were led to<br>conjecture that there was at least a temporary destitution of<br>reason. His conduct continued nearly the same long after he<br>was taken out of Court, and for several days after his con-<br>demnation, the cries from his cell arrested and annoyed the<br>passengers on the streets. He became afterwards, however,<br>more composed ; but still at intervals displayed a weakness of<br>mind, whieh, coupled with his extreme youth, might perhaps<br>have well excused the extension of Royal Mercy. Within a<br>few days of his execution, when he was assured on the evi-<br>dence of an official communication, that there was no hope<br>of the sentence being commuted; his behaviour became<br>more distracting than ever ; and it was deemed necessary to<br>attend him. constantly, bath with the view of keeping him<br>more at ease, and of preverting the sentence of the law from<br>being self-anticipated.<p>Campbell.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;since his uondemnation,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;till within&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;these few<br>days,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;took his&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;meals regularly,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and  in general&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;slept&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;well.<br>Latterly,  his rest was broken&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and disturbed,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;his impending<br>fate engrossing his whole attention ; and he was often exclaim-<br>ing, " How will&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I be  able&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to suffer  such a&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;death !&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While<br>conversing  with religious  people he was more  tranquil than<br>at other periods : and he frequently stated that his hope rest.<br>ed solely on the merits of  our Saviour.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The greater part of<br>last night was spent in a manner suitable  to the melancholy<br>occasion ; and the  prisoner seemed more composed  than be<br>had been for some nights previous.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  At 2 o'clock this morn-<br>mg, he threw himself on his bed, and slumbered till 8,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;when<br>he awoke, remarking that another hour of his time was gone.<br>He again&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;betook himself to rest,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and continued in&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a calm<br>sleep till nearly 5, when he got up, and entered seriously into<br>the religious conversation of those around him ; and fervent-<br>ly prayed that the Lord would strengthen him in his hour of<br>trial.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; During the forenoon, he was visited qy several of the<br>religious&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;inhabitants and clergymen of the&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;place,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to whose<br>prayers and&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;instructions  he  paid&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;particular  attention.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A<br>little before 2 in the afternoon,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;he was  led into&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the Court-<br>Room,  where,  as is usual,  the religious exercises were per-<br>formed,  after which,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;attended by the Rev. Mr Anderson of<br>Blair Logie,  he moved forward to the scaffold.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Centrary to<br>general expectation, the prisoner behaved with a great degree<br>of fortitude,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;until he dropped  the signal,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;when he  seized<br>the rope with his hand, and consepuently  by injuring  the<br>fall, prolonged his agony for some time.<p>John Campbell was born at the bridge of Kelty, near Cal-<br>lander, in 1804, and came to reside in the village of St. Nin-<br>ians, about a mile from Stirling, when very "young. What<br>education he possessed, he received at the parochial school of<br>that place. He also attended the Sabdath Evening School<br>there, but notwithstanding the good instructions he was then<br>receiving, he was in the habit of committing many petty de-<br>predations through the week, such as entering hen-houses,<br>and carrying off the poultry. He never could think of set-<br>tling at any regular employment, and to this, the breaking of<br>the Sabbath, and bad company, he attributed his awful end.<br>For two winters he followed after smugling, during which<br>attained a number of bad habits.</p>
