	<h2>Transcription</h2>
	<p> Speech of M. DUPONT, the French Atheist.<p>The late Enormities committed in France need not be so much wondered<br>at, as any Man of common Humanity would otherwise do, when it is con-<br>sidered that the Leaders of that miserable Country have thrown off all<br>Regard to Religion. The following is an exact Translation from a<br>SPEECH made in the National Convention at Paris, (on the 14th of<br>December last, in a Debate on the Subject of establishing Public Schools<br>for the Education of Youth) by Citizen DUPONT, a Member of consider-<br>able Weight.?And, as the Doctrines contained in it were received with<br>unanimous Applause, except from two or three .of the Clergy, it may be<br>fairly considered as an Exposition of the Creed of that enlightened Assembly.<br>------Translated from LE MONITEUR of Sunday the 16th of December 1792.<p>WHAT ! Thrones are overturned ! Scep-<br>tres broken ! Kings expire ! And yet<br>the Altars of God remain ! (Here there is a<br>murmur from some Members; and the Abbé<br>ICHON demands, that the person speaking may<br>be called to order.)  Tyrants in outrage to Na-<br>ture Continue to burn an impious Incense on<br>those Altars ! (Some murmurs arise, but they are<br>lost in the Applauses from the Majority of the<br>Assembly.) The Thrones that have been re-<br>versed, have left these Altars naked, unsup-<br>ported, and tottering.?A single Breath of en-<br>lightened Reason will now be sufficient to<br>make them disappear.?And if Humanity is<br>under Obligations to the French Nation for<br>the first of these Benefits, the Fall of Kings,<br>can it be doubted, but that the French Peo-<br>ple now Sovereign, will be wise enough, in<br>like Manner, to overthrow those Altars and<br>those Idols, to which those Kings have hitherto<br>made them subject ??Nature and Reason, these<br>ought to be the Gods of Men ! These are my<br>Gods! (Here the Abbé AUDREIN cried out,<br>" There is no bearing this ;" and rushed out<br>of the Assembly.?A great Laugh.') Admire<br>Nature?cultivate Reason.?And you, Legisla-<br>tors, if you desire that the French People<br>should be happy?make haste to propagate<br>these Principles, and to teach them in your<br>primary Schools, instead of those fanatical<br>Principles which have hitherto been taught.<br>The Tyranny of Kings was consined to make<br>their People miserable in this Life?but those<br>other Tyrants, the Priests, extend their Domi-<br>nion into another, of which they have no other<br>Idea than of eternal Punishments ; a. Doc-<br>trine which some Men have hitherto had the<br>Good-nature to believe.?But the Moment of<br>the Catastrophe is come?all these Prejudices<br>must fall at the same Time.?We must destroy<p>them, or they will destroy us.?For myself! I ho-<br>nestly avow to the Convention?I am an Atheist!<br>(Here there is some Noise and Tumult?But a<br>great Number of Members cry out?" What is<br>that to us?You are an honest Man.")&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But<br>I defy -a single Individual, amongst the Twen-<br>ty-four. Millions&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of Frenchmen,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;make<br>against. me any well-grounded Reproach.?<br>I doubt whether the Christians, or the Catho-<br>lics, of which the last Speaker, and those of<br>his Opinion, have been talking to us, can<br>make the same challenge.?(Great Applauses.)<br>There is another Consideration?Paris has had <br>great Losses.?It has been deprived of the<br>Commerce  of&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Luxury;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of that  factitious<br>Splendor which was found at Courts, and in-<br>vited Strangers hither.?Well! We must re-<br>pair these Losses.?-Let me then represent to<br>you the Times,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;that are fast approaching,<br>when our Philosophers, whose Names are ce-<br>lebrated throughout Europe, PETION, SYEYES,<br>CONDORCET, and others?surrounded in our<br>Pantheon, as the Greek Philosophers were'at<br>Athens with a Crowd of Disciples coming<br>from ail parts of Europe, walking like the<br>Peripatetics, and teaching?this Man, the Syf-<br>tem of the Universe, and developing the Pro-<br>gress of all human Knowledge; that, persec-<br>tioning the Social System, and shewing in<br>our decree of the 17th of June 1789, the seeds<br>of the Insurrections of the 14th of July, and<br>the 10th of August, and of all those Insurrec-<br>tions, which are spreading with such Rapidi-<br>ty throughout Europe?so that these young<br>Strangers, on their Return to their respective<br>Countries, may spread the same Lights, and<br>I may operate for the Happiness of Mankind, simi-<br>lar Revolutions throughout the World.-------<br>(Numberless Applauses arose, almost throughout the<br>whole Assembly?and in the Galleries.)<p>Note. On a late occasion, the People of Hainault, who have been conquered by France,<br>presented a petition to the National Convention, complaining, that they were more miserable<br>than under their former Government. But the President coolly answered, " That they had<br>" forfeited the first fruits of Liberty by their prejudices, and especially by their Habitudes<br>" Theocratiques ;" that is to say, their Habit of acknowledging the Existence and Power of God.</p>
