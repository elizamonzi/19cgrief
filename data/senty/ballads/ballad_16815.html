	<p> HORRID<p>Circumstance<p>In a Druggist's Shop in Town.<p>Account of that strange circumstance which took<br>place on Sunday night last in a Druggist's shop in<br>Glasgow ; the shopman and another person invit-<br>ed two young women into it, where after giving to<br>them spirits, lozenges and powders, a most brutal<br>attack was made upon them in the shop, when one<br>of them made her escape, and the other was found<br>by the Police lying in the shop in a state of insen-<br>sibility. What they meant to do with the women<br>has not been ascertained.<p>(Copied from the Glasgow Chronicle of Nov.  15th).<p>At the Police Court, on Monday morning, a case of the most atrocious nature was<br>brought to the bar. Mr --, a Druggist in -- Street, was, along with a com-<br>panion, accused of inviting two girls of the town into his back shop on Sunday night<br>about half-past eight o'clock, and there persuading them to partake of spirits, lozen-<br>ges, and some powders. One of them took a small quantity of the spirits, but would<br>take none of the lozenges or powders that were offered her. The girl who received<br>the maltreatment deponed to the Court that she took two glasses and a half of the spi-<br>rits, also a few lozenges; and that the companion of Mr -- then took out of dif-<br>ferent boxes in the shop, several stuffs and powders, some of which were sourish, and<br>others of a sweetish taste. This unconscious girl swallowed a quantity of these drugs,<br>and in a few minutes afterwards became insensible; after which she could recollect<br>nothing of the circumstance until she found herself in the Police Office. Her compa-<br>nion was then called to the bar, and after corroborating upon oath the statements of<br>the pursuer, deponed that after the pursuer became insensible, Mr --'s compa-<br>nion kicked and maltreated her in a most shocking manner, although the pursker was<br>at that time motionless and insensible. Mr --, who, perhaps, thought that the<br>kicking was quite unnecessary, interponed in behalf of the pursuer, as did the other<br>girl ; but both were struck by the assailant, who wished not to be interfered with.-<br>During Mr --'s interposition, witness succeeded in making her escape by a back<br>door, ran out to the street, raised an alarm, and called " Police." The watchman on<br>that station was then called to the bar, and deponed, that about half-past eleven on the<br>night in question he heard a woman crying at the shop door of the druggist, and kick-<br>ing violently for admission ; on enquiring the cause of her conduct, he was informed<br>of the affair inside ; he called another watchman, with whom, along with a man who<br>was passing at the time, he entered the shop. On entering the back shop, witness saw<br>a woman lying on the floor on her right side in a state of complete nudity and appa-<br>rently flead ; on questioning the prisoners, they made some silly apologies. Mr --<br>said to the officers that he would carry out the woman by the back door and leave her<br>there, and advised them to say that they found her there in that state. The verdict<br>of assault being clearly proven against the prisoners, they were amerced in a fine of<br>£5 each.<p>W. Carse, Printer, Glasgow.</p>
