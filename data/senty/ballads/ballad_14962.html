	<p> CUDDY  PEGGY.<br>COPIES CAN BE HAD  AT 190 AND 192 OVERGATE, DUNDEE.<p>In the high town of Gala lived auld Peggy Tinlin,<p>Wha was blessed wi' content, though at times took to grumblin'; <p>Her calling in life was provisions to hawk,<p>And David, her cud, bore them a' on his back !<p>Each morning they marched to their daily employ,<p>Nae task did they think it, but rather a joy ;<br>And David jogged on wi' his weel-laden creels,<br>While Peggy half-bent hirpled on at his heels.<p>Frae morning to micht thus wandered alane, <p>But aye at the dusk o' the gloamin' cam' hame;<p>And when Peggy had selt aff the guids o' her pack,<p>Then she mounted astride and rode hame on his back.<p>For mony a lang year thus they toiled on thegither,<p>And the langer they toiled they grew fonder o' ither,<p>For David shr seldom had reason to flog,<p>Thongh gently she touched him at times wi' the brogue,<br>But it happened a'e day that poor David took ill,<br>Which the heart o' auld Peggy wi' sadness did fill,<br>And a sorrowfu' tear filled the auld body's e'.<br>As she thocht tae hersel' puir David wad dee;<p>And seeing him placed in this helpless condition,<p>She thocht it her duty to get a physician,<p>So away for that purpose she hurriedly set,<p>When just on the way she the minister met.<p>" Well. Margaret! " he said, " I hope you are well."<p>" I thank you," said Peggy, " I'm gaily mysel' ;  <p>But I'm sorry to say oor David's no' weel, <p> An I'm just gaun away to get medical skill."<p>"Indeed, to hear that I'm exceedingly sorry,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<p>But, if spared, I'll come down and see him to-morrow,"<p>So wi' that Peggy bowed and speedily withdrew,<p>Syne awa' like the wind on her errand she flew,<p>The doctor came prompt at auld Peggy's request.<br>Thinkin' a' the road up what he might suggest <br>So his patient wi' skill he minutely surveyed.<br>And then shook his head and reluctantly said ! -<br>" His case it is bad?nay, hopeless I doubt-<br>But I'll try what I can to bring him about."<br>So he blistered and bled him and gave him a dose. <p>O' the best o' strong physic, as one might suppose,<p>And these means they were blest to bring David relief,<p>And to ease at the same time the auld body's grief,<p>For as David grew  weel her spirits grew licht,<p>And her e'e, lichtly dimmed, shone wonderfu' bricht,<p>The minister, who to his word ever true,<p>Come clown the next day as he promised to do,<p>On purpose, no doubt, as a matter of course,<p>To see whether David was better or worse.<p>" Well, Margaret," he said, " how is David to-day? "<br>" Deed, sir, he's some better, I'm happy to say ; <p>The doctor's been here, and used every means, <p>And to outward appearance some better he seems."<br>" I'm glad to hear that; I hope he'll recover,<br>And that both may be spared a while to each other."<br>" Deed, sir, I'm glad and thankfu' atweel.<br>For little I thocht to have seen him sae weel ; <p>But come in sir, and rest you a bit,"<p>" Oh ! thanks."'said he, " I scarcely must sit,<br>But, if it's convenient, with David I'll pray."<p>"Lord bless me, sir, what on earth do you say ?"<p>" I'll pray with your husband that's now in distress."<p>" The deil's in the man?would you pray for an ass ?"&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <p>" Oh, fie ! Margaret, he ! why don't you think shame<p>To call your poor husband by such a vile name ? "<p>" My husband !? I daursay the minister's mad? <p>It's mony a year sin' my husband was dead,"<p>" Oh, Margaret, you don't mean to say it is true?"<br>" It's as true as this minute I'm speaking to you,"<p>"Then is David your son or relation in blood?"<p>" Guid gracious'! the man? isn't David the cud?"<br>'A cud!" cried the parson; "aye, a cuddy! " cried she;<p>"Sic a farce to compare a dumb creatur' to me."<p>" Oh, Margaret! I find I've been quite mistaken,<br>I, David your cud for you husband have taken,<p>So pardon what I've in my ignorance said<p>And the awkward mistake into which I've been led."<br>So the priest no longer protracted his stay,<p>But wi' reverence bowed, and syne went away,<p>And laughed a' the road hame till nearly distracted,<br>To think sic a part in the drama he acted.</p>
