	<p>  EXCUTION.<p>A Full, True, and Particular A count of the EXECUTION of<br>JAMES BELL, late private in the 5th Dragoon Guards, who<br>was Executed this morning, at the head of Libberton's Wynd,<br>for the Murder of Serjeant-Major Moorhead ; together with his<br>Cunsession, his Behaviour in the Jail and on the Scaffold, and a<br>short Sketch of his  Life.<p>Edinburgh.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Monday, July 13,  1835.<p>THIS morning, soon after eight o'clock, James Bell, late private<br>in the 5th Dragoon Guards, underwent the extreme penalty<br>of the law, at the head of Libberton's Wynd, pursuant to his sen-<br>tence, for the murder of Serjeant-Major Moorhead, by shooting<br>him in the back with a pistol ball, while on duty at the stables at<br>Piers-hill Barracks, on Sunday evening the 17th of May last.<p>This unfortunate man was born in Ireland in the year 1808, of <br>poor but honest parents. He was bred a labourer, and in the year<br>1829 he enlisted into the 60th Rifle Brigade, then lying in Dublin,<br>where he remained for upwards of four years. Not considering<br>himself comfortable in that distinguished corps, he effected a trans-<br>fer from it to the 5th Dragoon Guards, under pretext of having a<br>senior brother in that regiment, which was afterwards found to be<br>a fabrication. About a year ago, this unhappy man, who was na-<br>turally of an unsettled and discontented disposition, was drafted<br>into Captain King's troop, of which the deceased William Moor-<br>head. a rigid disciplinarian, was Serjeant-Major. Bell appears to<br>have formerly suffered under his displeasure, for some misconduct;<br>and having been refused leave of absence from evening stables on<br>the day alluded to, he, in a fit of revenge, committed the rash act,<br>which has brought him to an ignominious end.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<p>Since his condemnation he was very penitent, paying the most<br>particular attention to the religious instructions communicated to<br>him by the Rev. Mr Terriot of St. Paul's Chapel and the Rev. Mr<br>Hunter of the Tron Church, both of whom were most assiduous in<br>their attendance upon him.<p>He was brought over to the Lock-up-house about half-past eleven<br>o'clock last night where he was immediately Waited upon by his<br>spiritual adviseres wich whom he spent the greater part of the<br>night in devotional exercises.<p>A little before eight o'clock, the Magistrates, attended by ther<br>officers, appeared in the ball of the Lock-up, when Bell was usher-<br>ed in, and underwent the operation of pinioning his arms.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After<br>prayer,  the  melancholy  procession  moved up the wynd,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and the<br>unfortunate&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;man&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;appeared  on the&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;scaffold  a  few  minutes&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;past&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>eight,  decently dressed.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<p>A most fervent and pathetic prayer was offered up on his behalf, <br>in which he appeared most seriously and attentively to join ; and, <br>after shaking hands with those around him, he was then assisted to <br>mount the fatal drop.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The executioner, who seemed much agi-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>tated and rather dilatory is his motions, was then assisted in ad-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>justing the aparatus of death, when the unfortunate man appeared&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>to pray very earnestly.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Every thing being ready,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;he then firm-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>ly dropped the white handkerchief, when, in a few minutes,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>drop fell, and he was launched into eternity,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;amidst a very great&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>concourse of spectators.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  He struggled a good deal, and was much<br>convulsed.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  After banging about six and thirty minutes, the body<br>was lowered down,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and afterwards conveyed to the Calton Jail<br>there to be interred, in pursuance of the sentence.<p>Sanderson, Printer, High Street, Edinburgh.</p>
