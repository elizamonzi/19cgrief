	<p> HORRID<p>DEPRAVITY!<p>A melancholy Account of the Death of two<br>Children, who were poisoned by a Man who<br>went about selling Candy, at Portobello,<br>near Edinburgh, on Tuesday last, in whose<br>Possession was found valuable Articles,<br>which he obtained from the Children in ex-<br> change for his Candy.<p>IT is with feelings of shame, regret, and indignation, at the du-<br>plicity of our country, that we here state the brief particulars of<br>the apprehension of one of the most diabolical imposters that has<br>for a long time disgraced our city.<p>On Tuesday last, one of those itinerant venders of what they<br>call Candy, who have, for a long time, disgraced our magistrates,<br>by allowing so perfect a nuisance, have been robbing us to our<br>very face, by encouraging our children to pilfer brass candlesticks,<br>spoons, or any other thing that they may lay their hands upon, in<br>exchange for their candy, made of dirty Treacle, manufactured in<br>the most dirty lodging-houses, announced his arrival at Portobello,<br>in the usual manner, by sounding his horn ; summoning the chil-<br>dren to prepare their old materials; at the same time spreading<br>his candy in the most ostentatious manner, to captivate the unsus-<br>pecting babes.<p>After some time of pretty brisk sale&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;he made his abrupt&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;de-<br>parture ;  this was owing to a young boy, the son of a respectable<br>grocer, bringing him a silver spoon, which he paid for by giving<br>the boy a stalk of his candy, pocketed  his prize, and sneaked off<br>out of the village.<p><p>In a short time, the boy and several others were seized with<br>convulsive fits, in proportion to the quantity of candy they had<br>eat. Mr Finlayson, surgeon, being called in, he gave it as his<br>opinion, that a quantity of poison must have been mixed with the<br>candy ; every exertion was used, but we regret to state that two<br>of the children died, one named Jones and the other Murray.<p>On the alarm being spread, Mr Bain, criminal officer, in<br>Portobello, repaired to Edinburgh in search of the delinquent,<br>and at last succeeded in finding him out in a house in the Grass<br>Market.<p>At his examination before the magistrate, he stated, that he<br>thought the spoon was of no value; and said, that the poison was<br>in all probability, mixed with the candy from the circumstance<br>that a rat-catcher having lodged in the same house with him the<br>night previous, who was preparing composition to poison some rats<br>in a grannery at Leith. A few more witnesses were called up<br>who corroborated the statement of the candy-seller, and who all<br>saw the rat-catcher mixing his composition.<p>The Magistrates acquitted him of the supposed murders of<br>the children, but committed him to take his trial for receiving<br>stolen goods to a considerable amount, which was found in his<br>possession.<p>Re-printed by DOUGLAS and KENT, Newcastle.</p>
