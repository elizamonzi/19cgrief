	<h2>Transcription</h2>
	<p> An account of the trial of eight Soldiers belonging to Breadalbane<br>Regiment of Fencibles, for a mutiny in the city of Glasgow, four<br>of whom received sentence of death, three of which received a par-<br>don at the place of execution, and the fourth was shot on Tuesday<br>the 27th day of January 1795.<p>The following is a true and accurate account of<br>the mutiny of the Breadalbane Fencibles, which<br>has for some time past, greatly agitated and alarmed<br>the minds of the inhabitants of this city.-<p>On Monday, the 22d of December a soldier of<br>the first battalion of the Breadalbane fencible regi-<br>ment, now quartered in this city, having been con-<br>fined in the guard-house upon an accusation of<br>having been guilty of a militaty offence, a party of<br>the regiment, with muskets and fixed bayonets,<br>assembled round the guard-house, & obliged their<br>officers to set him at liberty : after committing this<br>out rage, they behaved quietly and peaceably, and<br>did regimental duty in the usual manner, though<br>the spirit of mutiny still subsisted to such a degree,<br>that the private soldiers would not agree to give up<br>the soldier who had been released nor the ring-lead-<br>ers in the mutiny, to be tried for their crimes. Lord<br>Adam Gordon, Commander in Chief for Scotland<br>immediatly adopted the most vigorous measures<br>for apprehending the mutineers, by collecting,<br>round the city, all the troops which could be spared,<br>and general Leslie, Sir James Stewart, and Colonel<br>Montgomerie, came to town to take the command<br>of them, with a determined resolution forcibly to<br>lay hold of the aggressors, in case they were not<br>delivered up by the regiment ; but, before proceed-<br>ing to force them, it was thought proper to give the<br>regiment a short time to reflect on their conduct<br>and the danger in which they stood, if they did not<br>of their own accord do, what was deter-<br>mined should otherways be done by force of<br>arms. This prudent experiment happily succeed-<br>ed four of the ring-leaders having surrendered<br>themselves voluntary & unconditionally, on Tues-<br>day morning last, to Lord Breadalbane, who<br>were that day merched prisoners to Edinburgh,<br>under a strong guard of their own regiment, com-<br>manded by Capt. Campbell of the grenadiers, The<br>Hon Major Leslie, and Mr M'Lean, adjutant of<br>the regiment; having accompanied the party a short<br>way, were, upon their return to town, insulted by<br>a number of persons at the Townhead, who as-<br>saulted them with stones and other missile weapons<br>by one of which Major Leslie was knocked down ;<br>and he and Mr M'Lean were forced to take shelter<br>in a house, where they secured themselves from<br>the mob (who attempted to break open the door<br>and windows to get at them) till the Lord Provost,<br>Magistrates, and Officers, and the company of the<br>Breadalbane regiment, who weee on duty at the<br>guard-house; arrived and relived them from their<br>disagreeable and dangerous situation ; but, before<br>the Magistrates arrived the mob had dispersed and<br>remained quiet eversince; although the Magistrates<br>and General Officers in town have juged it prudent<br>to take every precaution to prevent tumult, by<br>detaining a squadron of the dragoons which had<br>been sent for from Kilmarnock, and ordering the<br>Royal Glasgow Volueteers to be on duty during<br>the night, The party of the Breadalbane regiment<br>who were called to assist the Magestrates in sup-<br>pressing the riot, behaved with the utmost ala-<p>crity and propriety, and received the thanks of<br>the Lord Provost. On Wednesday, the other<br>principal ring leader in the mutiny surrendered<br>himself, and was sent off prisoner to Edinburgh;<br>The punishment of the mutineers, it is hoped, will<br>prove a useful warning & admonition to the army<br>and convince them that crimes of such atrocity will<br>not pass with impunity...<p>Notwithstanding this unfortunate affair, it is but<br>justice to observe, that in every other view, the sol-<br>diers of this regiment have, upon all occasions, be-<br>haved themselves with the greatest sobriety, and<br>that they have been, and still are upon the best of<br>terms with their officers.<p>On the 12th of January the Court Martial met<br>in the Castle  of Edinburgh&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;for the trial of the<br>soldiers  for&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;mutiny,  belonging&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Breadalbane<br>Fencibles,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;composed  of the  following Officers;<p>viz.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  <p> Colonel H.

Four have received sentence of death ;<br>and four sentenced to corporal punishment.<p>On Tuesday morning the four under sentence <br>of death were taken  out of the Castle and convey-<br>ed in two mourring coaches, guarded with two<br>troops of horse to a field about two miles from<br>town, where they were to be shot, but threee of<br>them were pardoned, and one who had deserted<br>and likewise been among the mutineers was shot.<br>It is said his name is Sutherland.</p>
