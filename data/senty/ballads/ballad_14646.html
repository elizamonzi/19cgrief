	<p> A Full and Particular Account of the Execution of<br>JAMES STEVENSON, who was Hanged at<br>Glasgow, on Wednesday Morning, the 1st of June,<br>1825, for Highway Robbery; with an Interesting<br>Account of his Life and Transactions.<p>GLASGOW, June 1, 1825,....The unfortunate individual upon<br>which the sentence of the law was put in force this morning,<br>was convicted, at our last Circuit Court, of highway robbery, in&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>company with one Swinie, (who was outlawed) by attacking Mr<br>John Brown on the night of the 19th of January last, on the Cath-<br>cart Road, near the Fireworks, and violently assaulting him to the<br>effusion of his blood and the imminent danger of his life, and robb-<br>ing him of £25 in cash, two watches, and a variety of other articles.<p>Stevenson was found Guilty on the clearest evidence, and on pass-<br>ing sentence, Lord  Pitmilly addressed  him as follows:?" Painful<br>as the duty is, I feel it my duty, indeed, it is a duty which law and<br>Justice demands of me, to  pass on you the awful sentence of this<br>Court, for the grievous and wicked offence of which you have been<br>convicted, and that too, upon the most clear and positive grounds.<br>The crime of highway robbery is one that has always been punish-<br>ed with the utmost rigour, and most deservedly so, for it is one<br>that most materially affects the safety and well-being of the popula-<br>tion at large.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You cannot, I think, offer any thing in extenuation<br>of your crimes; for although the individual on whom you made<br>your ruthless attack, escaped with his life, there is every reason to<br>believe it was more the design of providence, than the wish of you<br>and your ruthless associates.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Nothing could exceed the base and<br>deliberate manner in which you committed this offence.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You went<br>out, at least you and your gang, coolly and feloniously to seize upon<br>your prey, and your victim that night was an old man....unattended,<br>whom you first beat to the ground, and who no sooner raised him-<br>self on his legs, than you, or two or more of you, made another<br>unmanly attack upon his  person, and robbed him of every article,<br>either of cash or otherwise, and even made off with his hat," His<br>Lordship then  warned  him to prepare for the terrible sentence of<br>death,'for crimes of the above description could not be allowed to<br>pass without the most rigorous punishment inflicted which the laws<br>of this country awarded.<p>Stevensen was about 21 years of age, and born at the village of<br>Muirhouses, a little to the south of this City; his father was a sea-<br>faring man, but died many years ago- He received an education<br>suitable to his station, and at the proper time he was sent to learn<p>the trade of a shoemaker, at which he continued about three years<p>when he left it: he was also a shart time, engaged as a turner, but<br>he soon relenquished it, and having fallen into bad company, he<br>committed several petty depredations. He was at last detected in<br>robbing a gentleman's house in the Gorbals, for which he was<br>committed to Bridewell.....Latterly he bad been employed in one of<br>the boats in rising Sand from the bed of the river. In the month<br>of march last a shop belonging to a Jew, in King Street, was broken<br>into and robbed of watches and other jewellery articles to the value<br>of £200 sterling, and all hopes of discovering the thieves had been<br>given up; but the robbers having quarrelled among themselves<br>about the division of the booty, one of them gave information<br>against Stevenson, when he was immediately apprehended, and in<br>the course of the investigation of the shopbreaking it was discovered<br>that he had also been guilty of the crime for which he this morning<br>forfeited his life on the gallows?another solemn warning to all<br>who are walking in the paths of crime, to turn from their evil ways,<br>for sooner or later detection will take place, and punishment will<br>assuredly follow.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <p>Dr. Dewar, Dr. M' Lean, and Mr Morrison, chaplain of the prison,<br>were assiduous in their spiritual exertions  for his eternal welfare,<br>and to whose pious exhortations he paid the greatest attention. He <br>freely acknowledged the justice of his sentence, and candidly own-<br>ed that it was  he alone who struck Mr Brown with the stab at the<br>time he was robbed.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Since his condemnation he gave information<br>that a number of the watches and  other jewellery articles, taken<br>from the Jew's shop, would be got below the sand in the bottom of<br>the boat in which  he wrought,  and upon  searching it they were<br>found and delivered up  to the  proper owner.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A petition was pre-<br>sented to Government in his favour, but the violent outrage on the<br>laws of which he had been found guilty, precluded the extension of<br>the Roya blemency towards him.<p>The usual time of execution was changed, on the present occasion,<br>from betwixt 2 and 3 in the afternoon, to betwixt 8 and 10 in the<br>morning, and consequently the croud began to assemble at an early<br>hour. Soon after 8 o'clock the culprit was brought into the Court-<br>hall, and after some time had been spent in devotion, he proceeded<br>to the scaffold, and when the fatal cord had been adjusted, he utter-<br>ed a short prayer, when the drop fell, and he was launched into<br>enternity.</p>
