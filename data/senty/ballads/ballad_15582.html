	<h2>Transcription</h2>
	<p> We have the following Account of a<br>horrid Murder committed by Pirates<br>on the Coast of Ireland, and how they<br>threw the Crew over board.<p>PEter Tartoue, Master of a French Vessel belonging to<br> Nants, being last Winter in the Harbour of Cork, took on<br>board four Passengers for France ; but they were no sooner at<br>Sea, but the said Passengers kill'd the said Master and all the<br>Crew, and carried the Vessel into Dart mouth, where they new<br>painted her, and made some other Alterations that she should<br>not be known: Monsieur Chamorel, the French Secretary,<br>having Notice of this, represented it to my Lord Carteret; his<br>Lordship, sent Orders for a strict Search to be made in all the<br>Ports of great Britain and Ireland, to have the Ship secured for<br>the Owners, and the Offenders brought to Justice. Some time<br>after this, an Information was given to his Lordship, that a<br>Person who call'd himself John Eustace, and, was under an<br>Arrest for Debt, was suspected to be one of those concern'd<br>In this Murder. Upon which, his Lordship, by Warrant, or-<br>dered him to be brought before him, and, upon Examination,<br>still insisting that his Name was Eustac, not with standing that<br>a Letter was found in his Pocket dire ted to him by the Name<br>of Roch, and written by his Wife; but being confronted by a<br>Captain, who had been personally acquainted with him for<br>several Years he confess'd his Name to be Philip Roch ; but<br>having prevaricated in several Particulars, which increased the<br>Suspicion against him, his Lordship committed him to Newgate<br>for Piracy, and violent Suspicion of Murder; after he had lain<br>in Newgate a few Days, he confess'd the said Murder, and na-<br>med his Accomplices ; as also the Murder of one Henry Ousley.<br>Upon his Description of the Persons of his Accomplices, and<br>his named the Places where they were most likely to be found,<br>his Lordship issued his Majesty's Orders for the apprehending<br>them: By which Means two of them, viz. Richard Neale<br>and Francis Wise, have already been taken in Ireland, and<br>Orders are sent for bringing them over here, in order to be<br>tried by a Court of Admirality, and diligent search is made after<br>the fourth.</p>
