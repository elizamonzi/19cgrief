	<p> EXTRAORDINARY.<p>APPREHENSION and EXANINATION  of the<p>EDINBURGH -.GENTLEMAN SWINDLER,<p>Just Published, a strange account of the proceedings<br>of Captain Smith, the notorious Gentleman Swindler,<br>who has taken-in a great number  of Noblemen and <br>Gentlemen residing in Moray Place, George Street,<br>Charlotte Square, Herriot Row, Anslie Place, Royal<br>Circus, Athole Crescent, Newington, Stock Bridge, and<br>most every Street in the Newtown, who was appre-<br>hended by Sergeant Major Ramage, of the Police, while<br>riding up the Cowgate on a black charger, when £250<br>was found in his pocket, and a French Gold repeating<br>Watch hung round his neck ; also his examination<br>before the Sheriff.<p>SWINDLING EXTRAORDINARY.?Information having<br>been given to the Police Authorities, that an individual<br>whose real name, as far as we know, is Thomas Diekson,<br>but who has many ALIASES, had again appeared on the<br>scene, and began his avocations  in the above capacity,<br>a zealous search was instantly instituted, and he was<br>fortunately apprehended on Thursday night by Sergeant<br>Major Ramage. This personage who has a very pleas-<br>ing exterior plies his vocation in the following manner.<br>He contrives to obtain some vague history of the family<br>whom ne intruds to direct his attack, and having this<br>far veiled his imposture, he generaly assumes their name,<br>and sets forth a piteous interesting and rather elegant<br>tale of his misfortunes. By this means he has imposed<br>on the credulity of several persons in this City, and ob-<br>tained from £1 to £8. To give an idia of the extent<br>of his impositions we give the following names which<br>he took?Galloway, Jardine, Maxwell, Smith, Cragie,<br>Johnston, Carthcart, M'Kenzie snd Ferguson. He first<br>appeared in this City in 1833, and, we believe, also in<br>September of that year, but notice of his rogueries having<br>appeared in the newspapers, and the public having been<br>put on their guard, he found the scene rather too hot<br>for him and he wisely took his, departure. Thinking<br>that this had all blown over, he made his appearance<br>about ten days ago, although all his misdeeds during that  period had<br>not yet transpired. However, it was discovered that he had swindled<br>£2. from a family in Moray Place, to whom he had applied under<br>the title of Captain Smith, of the Dima of Liverpool, and thus led to<br>his detection. At the time he was apprehended he was riding up the<br>Cowgate on a long tailed black horse, which he had purchased from a<br>horse dealer of this City. Ramage having surveyed  his man, immed-<br>iately accosted him, and taking hold of the bridle,tacitly informed<br>him that he was his prisoner. Upon this he reined up with great<br>dignity, as much as to say why he was thus rudely stopped. Ramage,<br>however, was not to be balked in his pray, and at once pulled him<br>from his horse, cook him to the Police office, and sent his Bacephalus<br>to the White Hart Inn stables. He was then taken down to the family<br>in Moray place and identified there, as well as at other houses where<br>he had committed his fraud. On searching him, no less than £250<br>8s. Sd. was found on him. In appearance this noted character is<br>about 5 feet, 9 inches, fair hair, and complection. and, on the whole,<br>as we have already said, of rather prepossessing appearance.  He was<br>always elegantly dressed, generally in a while hat, blue jacket and<br>surtont, with white or blue pantaloons, for he was fond of personating<br>nautical characters. When apprehended, he also wore a handsome<br>French gold watch, with corresponding appurtenances  all suspended<br>round  his neck in the most sashlonable style. There are 5 Charges<br>against him, to account for which he is remanded by the sheriff.<p>FORBES, Printer, Edinburgh.</p>
