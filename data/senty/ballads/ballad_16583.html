	<p> Copy of a very Curious Letter from a Cotton Spinner in Canada,<br>to his friends in this Country, containing a particular invitation<br>to all men going out to America to take a Cotton Mill Lass<br>along  with him, as they make the far best Wives there; with<br>many other curious particulars.?12th Feb 1827.<p>New Perth. Upper Canada, Sept.12,1826. <br>Dear  Brother - I recevied your long looked for letter.<br>and we are happy to hear that you are all  well, as this  leaves<br>us at present, think, be to the Author  of all good you<br>will recieve this letter  from John ?, who will inform<br>you  particularly concering  us and the  state of the country.<br>for he has been eight.years in this country and you know I<br>have been only three. But for the short time I have been,<br>we have prospered  well?we have had two children since,<br>John and Jean. They are thriving very well.We have<br>about eighteen screw of clear land, and twelve of them un-<br>der crops we have above fifty [  ] of wheat, Scoth mea- <br>sure, a great quantity of potatoes, barley Indian corn, me-<br>lons, cucumbers, pumpkin,and tobacco one; one milk cow, two <br>stirks, and a pair of oxen,we had some hardships the<br>first year, but now it in all over. We have no angry land-<br>lord craving his rent?every lives under his own vine<br>and plenty of food of the of the best sort. We have nine pigs and<br>44 sheep. We will always have plenty of wool. Our cou-<br>sin Rab has not come on so well as me for all his braw<br>country lass, which you will see by  the following story which<br>happened of late  between him  and  me, and  an Englishman,<br>You know that he often  said that  I would be ruined when I<br>married.  Jean but of the cotton  mills,  for the mill lasses<br>were good for nothing at all: that I need not offer to take<br>one of them so America, except I wanted to starve but I<br>think its rather reversed now.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <p>Well, you trust  know that an Englishmen, a neighbour<br>Of ours,of the name of Holden, and Rab and me, met one<br>day in a  public house in New Perth. We  had a hearty<br>glass, and through our conversation about our wives, every<br>one was for hauding out that his  own was the best. So, as<br>we were only about three miles distant from each other, we<br>Beat a gallon of rum,agreeing that the person who had  the<br>laziest, the dirtiest; and  most uncivil, wife,and clartiest<br>house, was ot pay the rum?so away we went to our cou.<br>sin Rab's  as it was the first on our road: and when we<br>came to Rab's door we could hardly get in for muck?but<br>save us, such a house and such a wife wi' dirt, you never<br>did see the like with your-eyes. No wonder though they<br>call the Scotch dirty, for her and her house were a disgrace<br>to our country and I must say most of the braw country<br>lasses. when they become wives are little better.You know <br>she has black  hair, it was all loose,  hanging down, the neck<br>and side of her head; her mutch and face were like as it they<br>had been sinoked up the lum for half a year; her blue-plaid.<br>ing  petticoat, once of true blue, was shamed  into black wi'<br>greim, the cogs, luggies, plares and spoons, were all-bark-<br>ened owre wi' kail and  porridge, for I suppose she never<br>washed them. She had two bairns half- dressed, trailing,<br>through the ashes. She asked. me for Jean, and the littie<br>bodies, and if Jean was aye as p[  ]fn' aud  braw  as she used<br>to be. Yes, praise be thankit, said I, from my heart, gien'<br>a glance athwart the house. The re awfu' folk thae cotton<br>mill women, said she, for gaun clean and braw. " O Jenny,<br>said I,"cleanliness is no pride." But a' this,time she<br>never asked us to eat or drink, Rab then asked her if there<br>was any spirit in the  house. She said there was but'a wee<br>drap in a bottle, and the bairns needed that, for they whiles<br>took a sair wime. The Englishm gave a smile and a<br>wink to me. Rab looked very sulky. I told them we must<br>go away, so off we went to the Englishman's, and left Jenny<br>scolding us for taking Rob wi' us. O, said Rab, I ken I'll<br>need to pay the bet ,but for a  that I must say that I never<br>saw  Jenny and her house so dirty  before. We then pro-<br>ceeded to the Englishman's dweling, where we found and-<br>ther sort  of a house and wife than Rab's. All was very<br>neat  and clean, and the wife tidy, kindly, frank, and civil,<br>and  at  once bestirred  herself to give us a hearty welcome,<br>by laying bread  and cheese before us, and  well filled rum<br>bottel. So. we took a slice of bread and cheese, and a glass<br>or two of good stuff, and then set off for my  house. And<br>sure enough when we went into my  house every  thing was<br>in good  order?just like  a  little  palace jean was  frank,<br>clean, and decent,as usual.<p>Here's my cotton Mill Lass, said to the Englishman;<br>whether do you think more of her ot of Rab's country girl.<br>Faith, said plain spoken John Bull, there is a mighty differ-<br>ence; the one is like an angel of lighty, and the of her like an<br>angel of darkness. Before we could look about us, Jean<br>set down plenty of tea, and bread, and butter?and when<br>that was done, plenty o' gude tody to man a' comfortable<br>and pleasant We were all very hearty but Rab: but the-<br>rum soon overcame his dulness, for we boused away till<br>morning. Then off we would all go for to drink  the gallon<br>of him at New Perth, as  we were as solved to mak'.Rab pay<br>for it, as he  was so positive about  his braw country Jenny.<br>but before we parted we made him convinced of his error.<p>So my advice to you is, John, to come<br>out to this country as soon as ever you can<br>in the spring, and bring my sister Mary<br>with you, she need not care about leaving<br>her lads? for there's more men than women<br>here, and she stands a chance to get a bet-<br>ter match  here than at home. And I would<br>advise you John to take out a wife out with<br>you, and if you have not fixed  your mind<br>on  one already, I would  advise you to<br>choose one out of Deanston Cotton Mill,<br>(Stirlingshire) as I think them preferable to<br>any of your country lasses round and round<br>and round for cleanliness and keeping a<br>house in order. Indeed  I must, however<br>say, there are some cotton lasses, about<br>Glasgow and Paisley, that I could  not re,<br>commend to any friend or acquaintance?<br>but as for Deanston Mill lasses, I would re-<br>commend them before any common lass in<br>the country, for washing, sewing, knitting,<br>carding and spinning, Keeping a house in<br>order, and  right  able to bring  up a family<br>of bairns clean and decent. so I have told<br>you all my  mind.<p>John Muir printer.</p>
