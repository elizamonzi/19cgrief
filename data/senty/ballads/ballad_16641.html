	<p> Life and behaviour of<p>S  A  M  U  E  L&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; B  E L  L<p>Late residenter at the Spittal, in the County of Durham. Who was<br>executed on Wednesday, 3d of September, 1800, at the West end<br>of the Tolbooth of Edinburgh, tor the crime of issuing forged<br>Notes.<p>THE unfortunate man whose untimely<br>end has in some measure now made an<br>antonement to public justice for his crimes,<br>was a native of the north of England, a man<br>in the prime of life, and was endued with a<br>good deal of address, and could accomodate<br>himself, as to outward appearance to any com-<br>pany. His father, who who still living, is an old<br>man and has attended his son ever since he re-<br>ceived his sentence, and by his appearance, in<br>circumstances no ways in an affluent condition.<br>The son, Samuel Bell, whether it was from<br>the smallness of his father's income, or owing<br>to his own wild and unsettled temper, we can-<br>not tell, neither read nor write; but at any<br>rate had he been well inclined or willing to<br>learn he might have done both: since he was<br>in such circumstances as could have afforded<br>it for himself; bat it would appear by his con-<br>duct, that he had thought this rather a happy<br>circumstance, as he imagined it enabled him to<br>carry on his unlawful traffic with the greater<br>security, and any person who had dealings<br>with him was much readier to be taken in by<br>him than by those who could read and write,<br>and in case of being detected he could the more<br>easily shift it from his own shoulders to some of<br>those who were his partners; but how vain<br>was the thought! he has himself fallen in the<br>snare, and it is hoped his untimely end will be<br>a Warning to his associates, who have escaped<br>from that punishment which their crimes have<br>merited, to refrain from their evil courses, and<br>to become better members of society, than they<br>have hitherto been.<p>Bell during the whole of his confinement,<br>and even under his sentence bore up his spirits<br>amazingly, and it his though; he had some<br>hopes of getting his sentence mitigated; his<br>wife who is now in confinement, even encour-<br>aged him that hope, and wrote him that he<br>had been making application to some great<br>persons for him, but the day before his exit<br>he was very much cast down and appeared ve-<br>ry penitent, acknowledging the crime for<br>which he suffered, and that he had fallen a vic-<br>tim to his own credulity in suffering himself to<br>be led away with such a set of wicked despe-<br>radoes, who, at last, had brought him to his<br>untimely end; but he thanked God that ha<br>was now enabled to foregive them, and he<br>hoped they would how see their folly and wick<br>edness in its true light, and refrain from it<br>and not only them but all others, who might<br>be tempted their lewed and debauched lives to<br>break in upon public credit.<p>His father went up on the forenoon of<br>Tuesday, about ten o'clock; to take his last<br>farewell of him, but the scene both at meeting<br>and parting may be more easily conceived than<br>described, they were both in the greatest a-<br>gonies of grief. The old man petitioned for<br>liberty to take charge of his body which was<br>readily granted by the Magistrates.<p>The REV. MR. DICKSON, who attended<br>him since his sentance, was with him a long<br>time in the afternoon, and urged him to make<br>a full confession, as he was now a dying man<br>and that it would be a great relief to him in<br>his last moments; and that be might do it<br>without mentioning names; he said, he knew<br>he was to suffer, and that he had been a great<br>sinner, but that be hoped for pardon through<br>the merit of Jesus Christ: He, at all times,<br>when he was spoken to for to confess cullen<br>and merose, and studiously avoided answering<br>any question.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  <p>A\ill\n as the jail opened this morning Mr.<br>Aikman attended him, praying and conversing<br>with him a long time, for which he returned<br>his sincere thanks to him and the other gentle-<br>men, who had been so solicitous for his soui's<br>salvation, which he hoped to obtain by the mer-<br>cy of God.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; .<p>Edinburgh ; printed by J, Morrison East Campbell's Closs Cowgate.<br> Glasgow-Reprinted by J.
