	<p> VERSES<p>On the  Melancholy  Death of JOHN WHITE,  his  WIFE, and<br>FOUR CHILDREN, who perished in the<p>Present Snow Storm,<p>Except one infant,  who was found sucking the breast of its<br>Dead Mother, near Pennycuick, on Wednesday morning last.<p>The fate of this unfortunate family has excited the greatest consternation in<br>the neighbourhood in which it happened. It appears that on the night before<br>they were found, that they were observed on the road going in the direction of<br>Pennycuick in a most deplorable condition, and had applied at several houses<br>for relief; in one tnstance, the man said he was a weaver from Paisley, and<br>had lately been employed in Glasgow. The snow on that night was ten feet<br>deep, and as two gentleman were out with their dogs on the following morning,<br>they discovered their lifeless bodies, and the youngest child clinging to the breast<br>of its mother. The infant was conveyed to a nurse, and is doing well. The<br>bodies of the suffererers were buried in the Church Yard on Friday.....The fol-<br>lowing are the Verses :?<p>ALL you who have a heart to feel,<p>Your fellow creatures woes,<br>Attend whilst I with acheing heart<p>A mournful tale disclose.<br>How six poor wanderers were forced<p>Not many nights ago,<br>To brave the raiging of the frost,<p>And face the drifting snow.<p>Christians shield at your door,<br>And do not frown upon the poor<p>Thro' Mid-Lothian the wand'rers roam'd<p>To beg their daily bread,<br>And heedless were to seek  A home,<p>Or lay their weary head ;<br>The night came on, their tatter'd clothed<p>But mock'd their shiv'ring irame,<br>The wind was high, and keenly froze,<p>The drifting tempest came.<p>The father's heart was full of grief,<p>The children loud did wail;<br>The mother vainly sought relief,<p>And sigh'd upon the gale.<br>Their hearts did fail, with grief & dread,<p>To feel the freezing blast,<br>At length,with joy,a neighbouring shade<p>Appear'd in view at last.<p>" Here we will rest," the father said,<p>" No father can we go,<br>" These children flocking at my side<p>" Are almost lost in snow;<br>" Come to my arms, dear children all,<p>" I'll strive to keep you warm ;<br>" And come, dear wife, behind me here,<p>" I'll shield you from the storm."<p>A lovely infant three months old,<p>Clung to its mother's side,<br>And though its little limbs were cold,<p>It drew the milky tide.<br>Hungry and faint they could not rest,<p>They rose to heaven a prayer,<br>That " He who feeds the ravens nest,<p>Would ease them of their care.<p>Again the storm came beating down,<p>And chilly was the breeze,<br>With wet and cold and weary limbs<p>The blood began to freeze,<br>Till death, the poor man's dearest friend<p>The kindest and the best,<br>Stretched out his kind and friendly arm<p>And closed their eyes in rest.<p>Early on the following day,<p>Some sportsmen took the field,<br>The dogs discovering where they lay,<p>The dreadful sight reveal'd.<br>The youngest had sutviv'd the rest,<p>Who every effort try'd,<br>from its dead mother's frozen breast;<p>To draw the milky tide,<p>All you that never felt a woe,<p>But what yourselves create,<br>For once a tender thought bestow<p>Upon their wretched fate,<br>Whose doom'd to suffer pain and grief<p>And thro' the world to roam,<br>Who never knew the dear relief,<p>That springs from home, sweet home;<p>Price One Penny,<p>Edinburgh:....Printed for James Docherty.</p>
