	<h2>Transcription</h2>
	<p> An account of the Life and Execution of John Stewart and<br>Catherine Wright his wife, who were executed at Edinburgh<br>on Wednesday the 19th August, 1829, and their bodies given<br>for dissection, for the horrible murder and robbery of Robert<br>Lamond, on board the Toward Castle steam boat on the 15th<br>December, 1828; with the manner  in which they behaved<br>since receiving sentence.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<p>EDINBURGH, 19th August, 1829.?This morning these two unfortunate,but<br>shockingly guilty creatures, paid, with their lives, the atonement  due to the grossly<br>offended laws of their country. With the exception of Burke, no criminals have ex-<br>cited so much detestation as the two of whom society has just been rid of.  It will<br>be recollected that Stewart and his wife were found guilty by the High Court of jus-<br>ticiury at Edinburgh, of administering such a quantity of laudanum to Robert La-<br>rnond, on board the Toward Castle steam-boat, as to occasion his death; previous to<br>which, and while lying in a state of stupefaction  they robbed him of his pocket book<br>containing of £20 or thereby.<p>After their condemnation they were attended by the Rev. Dr. Gordon and Mr.<br>Porteous, and were daily brought together for a short time to hear the same exbort-<br>ations, and they were inspired with the same grounds of hope. They spent much<br>of their time in reading the Bible and such religious books as were given them by<br>the ministers. He was so settled in his mind, that from his manner no observer<br>could believe that he was placed in the awful circumtances in which he stood. He<br>spoke freely, and without the slightest remorseful allusion to the events of his past<br>life. He was also particuiary callous to the end which, awaited him. By those who<br>had the best opportunities to observe the workings of his dispositions, he was cou-<br>sidered to be one of the most accomplished villains that ever came under the cog-<br>nizance of the law. He was ardent and fearless? resembling in these respects the<br>lower animals, which rush forward with an impetuosity which nothing cau impede.<br>As an instance of this trait in the character of Stewart, we may mentiem, that after<br>he was conveyed to Edinburgh for trial, he formed the diabolical plan, along  with<br>the other prisoners, of escaping from prison by murdering the turnkey and the go-<br>vernor. Luckily the scheme was discovered in time to counteract the operation of<br>this daring villain. He was in chains; but the woman was allowed greater liberty,<br>and was not manacled. She was very penitent.<p>At the usual hour the prisoners were brought from the lock-up (to which they had<br>been conveyed the preceding night,) to the place of execution, attended by the<br>Rev. Dr. Gordon and  the Rev. Mr. Porteous, chaplain to the prison, who had been <br>unwaried in their ministrations of religious instruction and consolation to the de-<br>linquents since their condemnation?The concourse of people assembled to witness<br>the execution was very great, and although not near so large as the  multitude pre-<br>sent when Burke was hanged, still from the peculiar atrocity of the offence for <br>which Stewart and his wife suffered, the crowd was much larger than is usually<br>brought together on an ordinaay occasion ?After some time spent on the scaffold in<br>prayer, and after Stewart had embraced his wife, the executioner proceeded to put<br>the daps over the heads of the unfortunate couple, which office he performed to the<br>female first and after every thing was adjusted, and they had continued for a few<br>minutes in prayer with the ropes fixed around their necks, the signal was given, and<br>the drop fell. The female struggled a good deal, but the man appeared to die easily.<br>After they had been suspended the time required, the bodies were cut down, and<br>delivered to Dr. Munro' for disection, when the crowd qnitely dispersed.?The<br>crowd expressed their detestation of these, horrid murderers by hissing and other<br>marks of disapprobation.<p>Stewart was a native of Ireland?he was bred a blacksmith, but had  wrought none<br>for l8 months previous to his apprehension, during which  period this accomplished<br>and notorious villain, had served a number of  individuals in the same way as he did<br>Robert Lamond.?His wife, who was about 22 years of age, was born in Glasgow,?<br>she had been married to Stewart about six years ago at Gretna Green; and she ac-<br>knowledged they had no place of residence, but had been travelling through Scot-<br>land in search of  employment.<p>The sensation which was  produced amongst all classes was almost as intense as<br>that which  was excited on the occasion of Burke's execution. There is little to cre-<br>ate surprise in that, when we consider how extensively, and how long the parties ex-<br>ercised their internal calling.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
