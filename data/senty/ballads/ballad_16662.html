	<p> An Account of the Trial and Sentence of Alexander Robertson, Alexander<br>Archibald, James Dickson and James McMillan, for breaking into the City<br>Auction Mart, in the Candleriggs, Glasgow.<p>HIGH COURT OF JUSTICIARY, EDINBURGH, 1st March,  1813. <p>Monday, the Court proceeded to the trial of Alexander Robertson, Alexander Archi-<br>bald alias Archibald Alexander, alias Alexander Watson, James Dickson, and James<br>McMillan, charged with Housebreaking, Theft, and Reset of Theft, in so far as they<br>did on the 4th or 5th day of October last, wickedly and feloniously break into, and enter<br>the shop No 17 and 18 of the Candleriggs Street, Glasgow, then occupied as sale rooms,<br>known by the name of "the City Auction Mart," by climbing up the roof of a back<br>building and forcibly entering through the roof by a sky-light; and did then and there<br>wickedly and feloniously steal and carry off 30 watches, 20 of which were silver and the<br>rest gilt or yellow metal watches,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 50 gold seals or thereby; 60  gold or gilt keys, 24<br>pair of silver, metal, and tortoise shell mounted spectacles; 200 silver pencil cases, and a<br>vast quantity of other jewellery articles, and amounting in value to 230 l. or thereby:<br>And farther, that they did also steal and carry off two men's black hats; or other wise,<br>that they did at Glasgow, or vicinity thereof, wickedly and feloniously rest and  receive<br>the said gold and silver articles, and other goods, knowing the same to have been stolen<br>And that the said  Alexander Robertson, James Dickson, and James McMillan having been<br>conscious of their guilt in the premises, and knowing that the police of  the city of Glasgow<br>Were making Strict search after them, did abscond and flee from justice within two days<br>after the said theft was  committed, carrying with them a great number of the stolen<br>articles,and were apprehended in Edinburgh, on Thursday the 8th day or October last,<br>when they had in  their possession a bundle containing a number of the stolen articles.-<br>And also, that the said Alexander Archibald, alias Alexander, alias Watson, did also <br>abscond and flee from justice, but was some time afterwards apprehended, when he had<br>in his possession a part of the stolen property, and had upon his head one of the hats<br>stolen from the said auction mart.<p>Moss Lee&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(This Gentleman being a Jew, requested to be sworn with his hat on, but<br>stated he had no objection to take the oath according to the forms of Court. Witness,<br>then proved the robbery of the auction mart, in the Candleriggs of Glasgow, of which<br>he had the ground flat. The robbery was perpetrated betwixt Saturday night and Mon- <br>day morning. Witness found  four drawers had been forcibly opened; the thieves appear -<br>ed to have entered  by  a skylight on a building at the back of the premises The prime<br>cost of the articales taken was from 230 l  to 250 l.Witness here stated the  number of the<br>articles stolen, consisting of watches, seals, rings, gold watch keys, snuff-box,  &c; and<br>identified a number of articles shown him to be his property, and stolen from his premises<br>and missed watches of the same maker's name, and same description as those now on the<br>table of the Court. Witness had not been in the shop from the Wednesday to the Mon-<br>day; his partner Mr. Myers, had the charge of It.<p>Ch. Maclauchlan, clerk to Mr. Love at the auction mart, locked the premises on the<br>Saturday night about eleven o'clock. On Monday morning he found the glass cases all<br>smashed, the drawers forced out, and blood upon the glass of the show-drawers. Two<br>hats were missing. Wittness immediately locked the door, and went and informed<br>Massrs Love, Lee, and Myers. Witness identifies two hats shown to him as bear-<br>ing Mr. Love's private mark. Witness put it on himself, but cannot say whather they<br>were in the shop on the Saturday night, but he can swear that two hats were taken away<br>of a simillar description.<p>John Davidson was apprehended on the streets of Edinburgh along with the prisoners,<br>Robertson Dickson,  and McMillan.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  They came to Edinburgh the night before which<br>was  Wednesday, by the Steam Boat from Grangemouth to Leith.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  They had stopt a<br>night  in Kirkintilloch, and  one  James Sharp was  in company.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They had come  from<br>Glasgow on Tuesday.  Witness had fallen in with the  prisoners in a public-house in<br>Duke-Street .&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A message came to his father's house by a boy,  to come to that public-<br>house, where he saw the prisoners,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;who gave him  some rum,  and asked&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;him to go to<br>Edinburgh&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  Witness said he had no money; but one of them said he need not mind that<br>  as they had some gold and silver watches in a bundle lying on the table.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Witness asked<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;where they had got them, and McMillan said they had got them at a " crack," the mean-<br>ing of which is a shop-breaking.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They did not mention where, and the witness having<br>got rather the worse of liquor agreed to go with them. Witness asked what they were<br>going to do at Edinburgh, they said in their cant language, to dispose of  the goods. Wit-<br>ness saw the bundle opened on Thursday morning in a house in Cowgate, Edinburgh;<br>saw some yellow watches, seals, and other articles. It was McMillan who opened the<br>bundle. Robertson and Dickson went out with a watch for the purpose of pawning it,<br>but they returned with it again. The bundle was then tied up in two handkerchiefs, and<br>Robartson desired the witness to go and pawn a watch for a few pounds but when they<br>get to the head of Bank Street, and were all standing together the Police Officers sur-<br>rounded them and took them prisoners. The watch Robertson gave the witness, was<br>found upon him, and a silver pencil case. Witness had heard from his father on the<br>Monday night before he was sent for by the prisoners, that he auction man was broke<br>into and jewllery stolen. Witness desired Sharp to tell his mother  he was going to<br> Edunburgh a  few days, but he never said the Police were looking after him. The res-<br>son the prisoners sent for him was, as they said he knew Edinburgh and they did not.<br>When they were in the track boat coming from Kirkintilloch, Robertson said he had<br>got his hand itched and he would need to buy some ointment. Witness looked at his<br>hand and it was scratched in several places. Witness thought that it was the itch, and<br>had not the appearance of cuts. Witness did not see the prisoner Archibald upon any<br>one of these days. The other three, with witness and a woman, were together en the<br>Tuesday night in  house in Great Hamilton Street:<p>The Jury then retired; but in ahout twenty minutes they sent the Macer into Court<br>With a verbal message saying, that as they had not made up their minds as to  the verdict<br>to be returned, they would do so to-morrow at one o'clock.<p>On Tuesday the Court met at one o'clock, when the jury returned their verdict, find-<br>ing Robertson Guilty of Shopbreeking, and the other there of Reset of Theft, when<br> Robertson was  sentenced  to be Executed at Glasgow,on the 7th of April, and Alexander<br> Archibald, James Dickson and James McMillan to be banished for fourteen years,<p>Printed for John Muir</p>
