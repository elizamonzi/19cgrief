I will tell thee then:-<p>Tis I that conquer all the SOBS of men;<p>No pitch of honour from my dart is free:<p>My name is Death. Have you not heard of me?<p>LADY Yes, I have heard of thee time after time ;<br>But, being in the glory of my prime.<p>I did not think you would have come so soon:<p>Why must my morning sun go down at noon?<p>DEATH...Ta1k not of noon?you may  as well be mute<p>This is no time at all for vain dispute;<p>Your riches, garments, gold . and jewels bright.<p>Your houses and lands must on new owners light.<p>LADY... My heart is cold ! it trembles at the news !<br>There's bags of gold, if you will me excuse ;<br>And seize on those (so finish thou the strife)<br>Who wretched are and weary of their life.<p>Are there not many bound in prison strong.<br>In bitter grief of son! who've languish'd long.<p>Who could but find the grave a place of rest<p>From all the grief with which they are oppresa'd.<p>Besides, there's many with a hoary head,<p>And palsied joints, from whom all joys are fled; <p>Release thou them whose sorrows are so great.<p>But spare my life to have a longer date.<p><p>DEATH...Though thy vain heart to riches is inclined,<br>Yet thou must die end leave them all behind ;<br>I come to none before their warrant's seal'd,<br>And when it is they must submit and yield.<p><p>Though some by age he full of grief and pain,<br>Till their appointed hour they must remain :<br>I take no bribe?believe me, this is true-<p>Prepare yourself to go; I'm come for you.<p><p>LADY  But if. O if you could for me obtain<br>My freedom, and a longer life to reign,<br>Fain would I stay. If thou  my life would spare.<br>I have a daughter, beautiful and fair,<p><p>I wish to see her wed, whom I adore.<br>Grant me but this?I'll ask no more.<br>DEATH...This is a siender. frivolous excuse ;<br>1 have you fast, and will not let you loose.<p>Leave her to Providence. for you must go<br>Along with me, whether you will or no :<br>II Death comnands the king to leave his crown.<br>He at my feet must lay his sceptre down.<p>Then if to kings I don't this favour give.<br>But cut them off can yon expect to live<br>Beyond the limit of your time and space?<p>No-I must sent you to another place. <p>LADY...You learned doctors, now exert your skill.<br>And let not Death obtain of me his will;<br>Prepare your cordials, let me comfort find.<br>My gold shall fly like chaff before the wind.<p>DEATH... Forbear to call; their skill will never do,<br>They are but mortals here as well us you :<br>I give the fatal wound- my dart is sure?<br>'Tis far beyond the doctors' skill to cure.<p>How freely can you let your riches fly,<br>To purcha e life, rather than yield to die;<br>But while you flourish here, with all your store.<br>You would not give one peony to the poor.<p>Thoug 'in God's aame their suit to you they make.<br>Yon would not spare one peony for his sake ;<br>My Lord beheld wherein you did amiss.<br>And calls you hence to give account of this.<p><p>LADY... O heavy news! must I no longer stay?<p>How shall I stand at the great judgment day !<p>Down from her eyes the chrystal tears did flew,<p>She said, None knows what I do undergo.<p>Upon my bed of sorrow here I lie.<br>My selfish life makes me afraid to die;<p>My sins are great . manifold. and foul.<p>Lord Jesus Christ, have mercy on my soul!<p>And though I do deserve thy righteous frown..<br>Yet pardon. Lord, and send a blessing down :<br>Then, with a dying sigh, her heart did break.<br>And did the pleasures of this world forsake.<p>Thus may we see the mighty rise and fall<br>For surely Death shews no respect at all,<br>To those of either high or low degree:<br>The great submit to Death as well as we.<p>Though they are gay, their life is but a span.<p>A lump of clay, so vile a creature's man;  <p>Then happy they whom Christ has made his care,<br>Who die in the Lord, aad ever happy are.<p>The grave's the market-place where all must meet,<br>Both rich and poor, both small and great:<p>If life were merchandize that gold could buy<br>The rich would live, the poor alone would die.</p>
