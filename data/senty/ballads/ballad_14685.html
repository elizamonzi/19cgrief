	<p> Trial & Sentence<p>Of JAMES BURTNEY before the High Court of Justiciary<br>at Edinburgh, on Monday the 18th Nov. 1822, for violating<br>the person of a Girl under shine years of age, at Prestwick,<br>near Ayr, when he was sentenced to be Executed at Ayr, on<br>Friday the 20th day of December next.<p>Edinburgh, November 18, 1822-----'This day came on before the  High  Court&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of<br>Justiciary, the trial of JAMES BURTNEY, indicted for, in so for as, upon the 14th<br>day of September, 1821, you the said James Bur ney did, on the lands of Prestwick,<br>in the united parish of Monkton, Prestwick,. and Crosbie, and county of Ayr, and<br>near a coal engine, wickedly and feloniously assault Janet Anderson, a child of eight<br>years or thereby, and daughter of James Anderson, wright, now or lately residing<br>near to Prestwick Toll-bar, in the said united parish, and having forcibly seized hold<br>of her, and having thrown her down on the.ground, you did then, and there, wicked-<br>ly and feloniously ravish her, and had carnal knowledge of her person, forcibly and a.<br>gainst her will, notwithstanding every assistance in her power: or otherwise, you did<br>then and there, wickedly and feloniously assault the said Janet Anderson, with intent<br>for to commit a rape upon the said Janet Anderson, and did throw her down upon the<br>ground, and attempt to have carnal knowledge of her person, forcibly and against her<br>will: and you the said James  Burnay Laving been apprehenece I and brought before<br>William Eaton,' Esq. shreriff.substitute of the county of Ayr, did in his presence at<br>Ary, on the 14th day of Sept. 1821. emit a declaration, which was subscribed in your<br>presence by the said sheriff.substitute, you having declared you could not write: which<br>declaration together with a certificate, dated ' Aya,'14th Sept, 1821,' and signed<br>' Will. Whiteside, M. D. John M'Deamaat. surg,' and also a pair of trowsers and a<br>shirt marked with blood, being all to be used in evidence against you the said James<br>Burtnay, at your trial.<p>As is usual in cases of this nature the Court was cleared of strangers, but it ap-<br>peared that the girl was not nine years of age at the time of the outrage, and she<br>was so much injured in her person as to be thrown into severe convulsions; she is<br>of rather a tender frame of mind and body, and was the daughter of his neighbour?<br>J. Anderson, wright at Prestwick toll.<p>The Jury retired for a few minutes, when they unanimously found him Guilty.<p>The Lord Justice Clerk then addressed the prisoner with much energy. A rape,<br>his Lordship said, had been committed under the most atrocious circumstances and of<br>the most aoominable nature? one more abhorrent to human  nature had never, he be-<br>lieved, been before a Court of Justice. He concluded his observation by Cautioning<br>the prisoner against entertaining idle hopes of any mitigation or punishment, as their<br>was no circumstances in his case that could warrant such an idea. The prisoner was<br>then ordained to be executed at Ayr, on Friday.the 2oth of December.<p>Much praise is due to the public authorities for the activity displayed in the ap-<br>prehension of this ruffian. About an hour after ;he commission of the offence, the<br>hue and cry was raised, an incalculable number of people, among whom were the<br>Procurator Fiscal, Mr. G. Taylor, the proprietor of the coal-works in the neighbour-<br>hood, and the late Sir Alex. Boswell of Auchinleck, went in pursuit in various di-<br>rections, and in about four hours he was apprehended in the stone-quarries in Con-<br>tent, and carried to prison. Burtney is an Irishman, about 20 years of age, aud had<br>resided in the neighbourhood for some years.<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Printed by John Muir, Glasgow.</p>
