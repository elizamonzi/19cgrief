	<p> BY  ROYAL  COMMAND.<p>THE following Rules and Regulations have been drawn up for the purpose<br>of putting down all forms of sin and vice:?<p>1.  No one to be out after dark.<p>2.  All people out of work, and those that are<br>starving, if they do not die within forty-eight hours<br>will be cremated alive.<p>All children born after January, 1905, to be fed<br>on asses' milk, until they are twenty-five years of age;<br>for, be it known, that our great Parliament of wise<br>heads has very graciously extended the years of<br>Babyhood.<p>4.  Any one caught laughing, or singing songs, or<br>playing any kind of musical instrument, will be sent<br>to jail for the full term of their natural lives.<p>5.  Any&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;man&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;or&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;woman&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;heard&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;using&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;strong<br>language in the presence of a Policeman,  such  as<br>"Pip! Pip!"  "Sugar and Tongs," or, "Go to the<br>Devil!" shall be immediately proclaimed a dangerous<br>lunatic; and the said policeman shall have the power<br>of ordering a straight jacket, so that the said offender<br>may be taken off to a padded room.<p>6.  No Publican to have a voice in anything; as<br>he has become a thorough nondescript, through his<br>own inherent weakness and in ability to defend him-<br>self. The LAW very generously permits a Land-<br>lord to select his own place of burial.<p>7.  Every three  months, the Great  Local<br>Magnates of Social Reform will distribute Prizes to<br>those&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;who&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;have  cultivated&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the  longest  and most<br>miserable Face; as beauty and cheerfulness belong to<br>sin and the devil.<p>8.  All shops, public-houses, and private houses to<br>be closed by 9 p.m. in summer, and 6 p.m. in winter<p>9.  All Theatres and Music Halls to be  entirely<br>closed , except on Sundays, when they will be used for<br>the purpose of holding Mothers' Meetings.<p>10.  All worldly books to be suppressed at once.<p>11.  Anyone found reading a frivolous or Worldly<br>Novel will have seven days in the Pillory.<p>12.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mothers' Meetings to be held three nights a<br>week?Mondays  Wednesdays, and Saturdays. All<br>over seven years of age must attend.  Non compliance<br>with this most solemn command will be punished by<br>fine and imprisonment.<p>13. Young men and women eligible for courtship<br>must get the sanction of the Wish-I-may-die Society."<p>14. Any man going for a walk without his wife,<br>shall forfeit all rights of citizenship, and be expelled<br>from the " Wish-I-may-die Society."<p> 15. Bigamy will be punished by sudden death.<p>16.  All fresh Air to be taxed; and even the Sun<br>will not be permitted to shine, without a permit from<br>the " Wish-I-may-die Society."<p>17.  Every Policeman to have a good moral char-<br>acter, must hold teetotal principals, and be strictly<br>pious.<p>18.  All Publicans to attend the "Wish-I-may-die<br>Society" twice each Sabbath day.  Non compliance<br>with this most solemn rule, the licence will be en-<br>dorsed.<p>19.  Respectability to be a very prominent feature<br>in our new code of moral discipline. All male attire<br>to be black, female loveliness to be draped in white,<br>the emblem of Purity.<p>20.  All tom eats to be strangled immediately they<br>are born as they are like the human mind for solemn<br>devotions.<p>21.  Any person caught minding his own business<br>will be fined 10s.<p>22. Any person caught playing penny nap will be<br>sentenced to 7 years penal servitude.<p>23. Every person earning 18s. and upwards per<br>week must get a permit from the " Wish-I-may-die<br>Society " to spend the said 18s., with full instructions<br>as to how it shall be spent.<p>24.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All liberty to be  banished from the country<br>after this date, as we are no longer free agents.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A<br>General Meeting to be held on the first day of every<br>month.<p>25.  All intoxicating drinks to be labelled " Sin and<br>the Devil," so that the innocent shall not fall.<p>26. Those who fail to carry out the above rules and<br>regulations for the better government of Society,<br>shall not enjoy the rest of the Saints, but shall be<br>cast into outer darkness, where the " Moral Man "<br>goeth not.<p>27. We (the Great and All-powerful), intend to<br>enjoy ourselves as we think fit, as we have bought the<br>Earth. The poor have no right to live.</p>
