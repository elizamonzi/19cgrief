	<p> Riot at Dumfries!<p>Hare s Arrival.<p><br>A Full and Particular Account of the<br>Reception of WILLIAM HARE,<br>one of the West Port Murderers, at<br>Dumfries, on Friday morning last, on<br>his way to Ireland !<p>This atrocious character was liberated on Thurs-<br>day evening, the 5th February, from the Calton<br>Jail, and took his seat, disguised, in the mail for<br>Portpatrick ; but having been recognized at Dum-<br>fries, a terrible riot took place in consequence.<br>The Mob having attacked the Jail wherein he had<br>taken shelter.....We copy the following paragraph<br>from the Courant of this day :<p>"THE MURDERER HARE.?We mentioned in<br>our last publication, that this wretch had been ob-<br>liged, to seek refuge from the fury of the populace<br>in the King's Arms Inn, Dumfries  It appears he<br>was recognised in the following manner: He was<br>entered from Edinburgh for Portpatrick as an out-<br>side passenger in the mail by the name of Black ;<br>and after travelling a stage or two, the guard,<br>without knowing him, consented to allow him to<br>get inside the coach, as the night was damp and <br>cold, but he had only got up one or two of the<br>steps at the coach door, when a highly respectable<br>legal gentleman, who was an outside passenger,<br>and who knew him, having been professionally<br>employed in the late case against the ruffian, call-<br>ed out, " Would you put a murderer inside ?"<br>This led to the discovery, and the coach had not<br>long arrived at Dumfries when the news of his in-<br>famous arrival became generally known. A crowd<br>instantly assembled, evincing the most determin-<br>edly hostile intentions. For protection, the wretch<br>was locked up in the tap-room of the Inn until the<br>Porcpatrick mail should start, which is usually<br>about nine o'clock Until that hour the mob,<br>though it continued to increase, many coming no<br>doubt to get a glimpse of such a notorious charac-<br>ter, was tolerably quiet, under an expectation that<br>he would take his departure by the Portpatrick<br>mail. By nine o'clock, for half a mile on, the<br>road, the crowd became immense.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<p>"The coach drew up to the inn door, but for<br>Hare to have ventured out would have been cer-<br>tain destruction, and, consequently, the coach drove<br>off without him. It had not proceeded far when<br>it was stopped by the populace, and a most strict<br>search was made in case he was concealed, even<br>the boor was examined. Being disappointed, the<br>people became more enraged, and, in consequence,<br>the magistrates were seriouly alarmed for the peace<br>of the town. As a russe, they caused a post-chaise<br>to draw up at the front of the inn, into which, it<br>was stated, Hare would proceed on his journey.<br>They, at the same time, however, got another chaise<br>to the bottom of the yard of the inn, from whence<br>he contrived to escape unobserved from a back<br>window and to walk along to the vehicle, which<br>was driven rapidly to the jail, followed by the mob,<br>who soon found out the trick. The jail was then<br>assailed with stones, the most of the windows of<br>the Court Room were broken, and one of the doors<br>forced. The police and constables, however, suc-<br>ceeded, with some difficulty, in restoring order,<br>but the crowd remained in the street till after<br>dark. During the night, the wretch was taken out<br>of jail and privately conveyed on foot out of town,<br>on the Carlisle road, under an escort of police<br>officers," Edinburgh Evening Courant, Feb. 9, 1829.<p>PRICE ONE PENNY.</p>
