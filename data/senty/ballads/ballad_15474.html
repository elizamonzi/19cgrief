	<p> A Pull and Particular Account of the Trial and Sen-<br>tence of WILLIAM ALLAN, who was tried at<br>Edinburgh, on Tuesday the 27 th of December, 1825,<br>for the Barbarous Murder and Robbery of Alexander<br>M'Kay, on the 17th September last, and who is to be<br>Executed at Aberdeen, on Friday the 10th February,<br>1826, and his body to be delivered over to the Pro-<br>fessor of Anatomy of that city for Dissection.<p>YESTERDAY, Tuesday, December 27, 1825, came on before<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the High Court of Justiciary, the Trial of WILLIAM ALLAN,<br>late  Crofter at Arthur Seat, in the Parish of Monquhitter, and<br>County of Aberdeen, accused of the crime of Murder and Rob-<br>bery, committed on the person of Alexander M'Kay, late Drover or<br>farm-servant, by having, with the loaded end of a whip, or some<br>other blunt and heavy instrument, struck him several times severely<br>on the head, face, and sides, whereby he was knocked to the ground,<br>his skull fractured, and one of his ribs broken ; and while in that<br>state, of having robbed him of a one pound note, and several pieces<br>of silver coin ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and in consequence of these  wounds,  Alexander<br>M'Kay  was  mortally wounded, and died on&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the night of the 2d<br>October last; to which Allan pled Not Guilty.<p>William Simpson, procurator-fiscal of Aberdeen, identified the<br>declarations of the pannel, several articles of apparel worn by him<br>at the time of his apprehension, also the whip,....it was a loaded<br>cart-whip, with a brass handle ; also a plaid which belonged to the<br>deceased, two one pound notes, and some pieces of silver coin found<br>upon the prisoner, and referred to in his declaration. Mr Simpson<br>also identified a deposition of M'Kay, taken previous to his decease,<br>and that he was perfectly collected at the time.<p>Captain Jonathon Forbes, of the 78th regiment, passed the toll-<br>bar of Fyvie, on the 17th September, on his way to Aberdeen.<br>Arrived at the toll about nine o'clock in the morning. Heard of a<br>man being robbed, and went into the doctor's house, and found a<br>man there with a large wound in his head. There were some por-<br>tions of brain on his shouldet. He called himself Alexander M'Kay,<br>and said he belonged to Satherlandshire. Witness went for Mr<br>Hay, a magistrate. The man described the place where he was<br>robbed to be about half a mile from the inn. He said he had been<br>knocked down by a man, William Allan, who had travelled with<br>him. He described Allan's dress accurately,....a militia cap, brown<br>snuff-coloured coat, trowsers, and short boots, and a whip. He said<br>it was with the whip he had been struck, and that it had a heavy<br>head ; and that he had been robbed at the same time of 36s. He<br>said he had slept with Allan the night before at Daviot; that he<br>suspected the day before that Allan had some design against him,<br>as he had wished him to go through a wood, which he refused.<br>That Allan had seen him count his money several times. Witness<br>asked M'Kay how he had continued with Allan after suspecting<br>him ; to which he replied, that he had spoken so fair to him, and<br>premised him lodging for nothing with his father till the fair of<br>Tarvis. Witness saw some marks of whins, on M'Kay's shoulder.<br>Mr Hay rode to the place, along with witness, where they found a<br>hat, and stick, which were M'Kay's. Witness rode to Aberdeen<br>that night, and gave information to Mr Simpson. It was a very<br>lonely place where they found the hat and stick.<p>Several witnesses described meeting the deceased and the prisoner<br>travelling together towards Fyvie, within eight miles of which, at<br>Comieston, the latter resided.<p>The Jury were addressed for the Crown by the Lord Advocate,<br>and for the pannel by Mr James Gordon The Lord Justice Clerk<br>summed up. After being inclosed about fifteen minutes, the Jury<br>returned a unanimous verdict of Guilty.<p>Lord Meadowbank, after commenting upon the murder perpe-<br>trated by the pannel, which'for encrmity was unparalleled, consider-<br>ing the insignificance of the object to be gained by it, proposed that<br>he should be executed at Aberdeen, on Friday the 10th February<br>next, betwixt the hours of two and four afternoon, and his body<br>given over to the Professor of Anatomy in that city for public dis-<br>section. Lord Mackenzie and the Lord Justice Clerk having con-<br>curred, judgment was pronounced accordingly.<p>The pannel is a young man, who, we understand, was married<br>only four or five months previously to the commission of the crimes,<br>for which he is to suffer. He appeared earnest but composed<br>throughout the trial; while the Jury were inclosed, he appeared ex-<br>cessively anxious to speak to one of the witnesses, who, notwith-<br>standing his many signals, did not approach him.<p>Edinburgh :?Printed for William Henry?Price One Penny.</p>
