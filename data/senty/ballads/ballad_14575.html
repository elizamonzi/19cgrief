	<p>   TRIAL<p><p>Full, True, and Particular account of the<br>Trial of Samuel M'Lauchlan, master<br>baker, and Thomas Badger, before the<br>High Court of Justiciary, for the Riots<br>at Lauder at the election of a member of<br>parliament, and for assaulting Lord Mait-<br>land, the Sheriff of the County, the Fis-<br>cal, and Mr Simpson, one of the Magis-<br>trates, by forcing him into a coach and<br>driving him out of the town, in purpose<br>to keep him from voting,<p><p>This day came on before the High Court of<br>Justiciary the trial of Samuel M Lauchlan, baker,<br>and Thomas Badger, shoemaker, both residing in<br>the town of Haddington, for mobbing, rioting, and<br>assault; also for violently carrying off Mr Simpson<br>one of the Magistrates, so as to defeat the franchise<br>at the country election, which took place at Lauder ,<br>on the 4th day of May last.<p>The prisoners, although implicated in forming<br>part of the said mob, yet they became responsible<br>as being art and part in attacking Lord Maitland,<br>one of the candidates ; also with attacking the<br>Sheriff and the Fiscal of the county, and with as-<br>saulting Mr Simpson, by hurling him a consider-<br>able distance on the street, and putting him into<br>a post chaise, when he was driven off, whereby he<br>was prevented from attending the meeting that was<br>to take place that day.<p>It appeared from the evidence adduced by se-<br>veral respectable inhabitants belonging to Had<br>dington and Lander, that on the day fixed for the<br>election of a member of parliament, gangs of dis-<br>orderly persons marched into Lauder, from Had-<br>dington, Galashiels, Tranent, Kelso, and .surround-<br>ing districts, headed by music, carrying bludgeons<br>and flags, and bearing yellow cockades on their<br>breasts and hats. These outrageous mobs were<br>addressed by the prisoner M'Lauchlan, who instil<br>gated them on to riot.<p>During the course of the day the Court House<br>was broken into; Mr Simpson, councillor, hurled<br>through the streets, and carried off in a post chaise ;<br>Lord Mainland the unpopular-candidate, the Sheiiff<br>and the Fiscal, were attacked and severely beaten<br>and maltreated.<p>Two of the Magistrates of Haddington gave the<br>pannel. good characters, only that they considered<br>M'Lauchlan as an eccentric character. He was<br>often seen spouting, addressing crowds, and severl<br>times had played the part of a Merry Andrew.<br>The Solicitor General addressed the Jury at great<br>length. He said that although the prisoners did<br>not actually make personal attacks upon the func-<br>tionaries mentioned, yet it was clearly proved that<br>the prisoner M'Lauchlan had stimulated the mob<br>to not, and that, any person who is present at such<br>notons mobs become in part responsible for the<br>damage done and violence used.<p>The advocate for the pannels having addressed,<br>the Jury, the Lord Justice Clerk summed up the<br>evidence.<p>The Jury returned a vordict of not guilty against<br>Badger, and&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;not  proved  by  a&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;majority, of one<br>against M'Lauchlan.<p>FORBES  & KAY,Printers, 171.Cowgate..</p>
