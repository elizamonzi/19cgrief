	<p> An account of the Trials of the different Criminals, in the Circuit Court of Justiciary at<br>Glasgow, which was opened on Tuesday the 2d of May, 1809.<p>THE Circuit Court of Justiciary was opened<br>at Glasgow on Tuesday the 2d of May, by<br>the Right Honourable Lords Craig and Armadale,<br>when&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <p>M. Simpson and J. Stafford, accused of assault<br>and robbery, were brought to the Bar. They<br>both pleaded guilty, and were sentenced to I4<br>years' transportation. <p>The Court next proceeded with the trial of John<br>Duncan, accused of murder or culpable homicide.<br>After a short trial he was unanimously found not<br>guilty, and dismissed from the Bar.<p>J. Hastie, charged with an assault and robbery,<br>was next put to the Bar, and, after a trial of con-<br>siderable length, was found guilty, and adjudged<br>to be confined in the Tolbooth of this city for six<br>months.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<p><p>James Hannah, accused of assault and robbery,<br>and of being habit and repute a thief, was unani-<br>mously foand guilty.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <p>John M'Allister, accused of stealing bank notes,<br>was then put upon his trial; but the libel being<br>found not proven he was dismissed from the bar.<p><p>Wednesday, John Frazen, charged with forg-<br>ing a letter from James Boatson, Supervisor of<br>Excise in Bonhill, for the purpose of obtaining de-<br>livery of a quantity of salted herrings, and of salt,<br>which had been seized from Fraser as contraband,<br>and lodged in the house of Mrs. Craig, inn-keeper<br>at Gairloch-head. Several witnesses were examin-<br>ed, in particular two Engravers, to make out the<br>forgery comparatione literarum. The Jury were<br>ably addressed by the Advocate Depute on the part<br>of the Crown, and a very ingenious defence was<br>made for the prisoner by Mr. Jardine; after which<br>the evidence, was summed up by Lord Armadale,<br>and the Jury being enclosed, returned a verdict<br>finding, by a plurality of voices the libel proven-<br>He was sentenced to eight months' imprisonment<br>in the Tolbooth of Glasgow. Their Lordships ob-<br>served , that the former good character of the pri-<br>soner, Fraser, as sworn to by very respectable wit-<br>nesses, was a consideration which inclined them to<br>inflict a more lenient punishment than would other-<br>wise have been imposed.<p>Thereafter the Court proceed to the trial of<br>William Alexander Campbell, for uttering certain<br>notes of the Renfrewshire Bank, knowing them to<br>be forged. After several witnesses had been ex-<br>amined, the trial was abandoned, owing to an er-<br>ror in the indictment, in the description of certain<br>notes, which the Counsel for the prisoner contend-<br>ed could not therefore be produced in evidence a-<br>gainst him. The Court, after hearing Counsel,<br>sustained the objection, and the trial having been<br>in consequence abandoned, the Jury were enclosed,<br>and returned a verdict, finding the libel not proven,<br>and he was dismissed from the Bar.<p>The diet was deserted, pro loco et tempore, a-<br>gainst George Stewart, John Armstrong, and John<br>Gordon M'Intosh, accused of housebreaking and<br>robbery, and a new warrant was granted for their<br>recommitment. It is understood their trial will<br>come on before the High Court of Justiciary.<p>THURSDAY, May 4.<p>This morning the Court proceeded to the trial<br>of Hugh Ramsay, for culpable homicide. After<br>the examination of two witnesses the public prose-<br>cutor declined proceeding farther. The Jury were<br>then enclosed on the case.<p>William Kirkwood, hostler at Bowling Inn, was<br>put to the Bar, accused of the murder of William<br>Smith. After a long trial, the Jury, by a majority,<br>found the libel not proven, and Kirkwood was dis-<br>missed from the Bar.<p>On the prisoner, James Hannah, found guilty of<br>robbery, and of being habit and repute a thief, be-<br>ing brought into Court, John Wood, Esq. Advo-<br>cate, his Counsel, pleaded, in bar of any sentence<br>being pronounced against him, that the five Gentle-<br>men who were last named as the Jury of the priso-<br>ner, had never been sworn, and that therefore the<br>alleged verdict returned by the Jury was null and<br>void; and he craved that the prisoner be dismissed<br>from the Bar. The Court, before proceeding to<br>consider the objection, ordered a proof of the fact;<br>and four of the five Gentlemen who, it was alleged,<br>had not been sworn when impannelled on this trial,<br>being instantly adduced and examined on oath as to<br>the foresaid allegation, three of them deponed that<br>they were certain that they had not been sworn; and<br>the fourth Gentleman, that he thought that he was<br>not sworn, when named Juryman on this trial.-<br>Their Lordships inclined to sustain the objection;<br>but on account of the importance of the case, they<br>ordered it to be reported to the High Court of Jus-<br>ticiary for their opinion and decision; and the pri-<br>soner to be transmitted to Edinburgh, to be present<br>at the discussion to take place on the 22d current.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>This finished the whole of the criminal business.<p>AIR, April 20.<p>This day came on the trial of William Dornan,<br>blacksmith, and Robert Smyth, shoe-maker.-<br>They were accused of having, by means of false<br>keys, or otherwise, on either of the nights between<br>Saturday the 10th and Monday the 12th of Sept.<br>1808, entered the shop of Miss Margaret M'Mur-<br>ray, in Air, and carried away a large quantity of<br>goods, which consisted principally of nineteen<br>pieces of print, five of gingham, silk chambray,<br>black silk velvet, cotton velvet, spotted muslins,<br>imitatation shawls, hankerchiefs, &c.<p>The robbery was clearly proven, and the priso-<br>ners were sentenced to be executed on Friday the<br>26th day of May, between the hours of two and<br>four afternoon, at the place of execution within<br>the parish.<p>DUMFRIES, April 26.<p>The Circuit Court of Justiciary was opened here<br>on Monday last, by the Right Honourable Lord<br>Hermand.<p>Michael Donelly and James Duffy, late weavers<br>in Carlisle, accused of forgery. The Jury, by a<br>plurality of voices, found the libel proven against<br>James Duffy; and they, by a plurality of voices,<br>found the libel not proven against Donelly, who<br>was dismissed from the Bar.<p>James Duffy was sentenced to be executed here<br>on Wednesday the 31st day of May next.<p>Printed by Thomas Duncan, 159, Saltmarket.</p>
