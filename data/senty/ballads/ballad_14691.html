	<p> EXECUTION <p>OF&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <p>MRS.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;M'KINNON,<p>Who was Executed at Edinburgh on Wednesday morning the<br>16th April, 1823, in the presence of' 30,000 spectators, for the<br>Murder of Mr. Wm. Howat, and her body given for dissec-<br>tion; with an account of her Dress, Behaviour, and Dying<br>Declaration on the scaffold.<p>Edinburgh, April  6 ?.This day Mrs. M'KINNON was Executed here pursuant to<br>her sentence. for the Murder of Mr Wm Howat, a writer's clerk by stabbing him<br>with a knife. It appeared that Mrs. M'Kinnon kept an infamous house on the South<br>Bridge, and that Howat, along with some companions on the evening of the 18th<br>of February last went to her house intoxicated and after drinking some time a<br>squabble took place betwixt them and some of the girls who lodged in her house.<br>Mrs. M'Kinnon was absent at the commencement of the affray, but she soon arrived,<br>and flying into a passion, said " Give  me a knife and  I will soon settle the b------,"<br>she  then deliberately went to a knife-case, and snized a knife, with which she gave<br>Howat a mortal wound in the breast, of which he died several days after in the In-<br>firmary. Her trial lasted 18 hours, and excited the greatest interest, and till near<br>the end, she had great hopes that it would prove favourable to her, but when she<br>heard the verdict, she exclaimed, " Lord have mercy on me," and immediately<br>fainted.<p>Mrs. M'Kinnon has conducted herself since her trial with the greatest propriety,<br>At first, her mental agony was so excessive, that she refused sustenance of every<br>kind, until the evening of the following Sunday; but since then she acquired more<br>fortitude and on being informed that  her petition for mercy could not be complied<br>with, she heard final doom with the greatest composure. Early on Monday morning<br>She was removed from the Calton hill Jail to the Lock-up-house; she appeared very<br>dejected, and was supported on the arm of  an old woman.<p>About half-past eight o'clock she left the Lock-up-House, attended by the Ma-<br>gistrates, officers, and the Rev. Mr. Porteous, the chaplain of the prison and seve-<br>ral other  pions  Gentlemen, and proceeded with a slow and feeble step to the head of<br>Libberton's W ynd, where the scaffold was erected On her arrival at the fatal spot<br>she appeared greatly agitated, and a general sigh of sorrow pervaded the immense<br>multitude  who had assembled to witness her melancholy end<p>During the  time that the awful preparations were  going on, she was  supported by<br>two of the attendants; she denied to the last as having committed the murder and<br>hinted that first a woman of the name of M'Donald was the perpatratior; but she died in<br>peace with  all men; she trusted in Him who hath said, "He that sincerely repent-<br>eth shall be freely  forgiven." The fatal cord being adjusted, a short but impressive<br>prayer was pronounced in which she seemed fervently to join; about five minutes<br>before nine o'clock this unhappy victim of passion expiated with her  life, the  outrage<br>which she had committed on the laws of God, and of her country ?an  awful warning<br>to the dissipated of the one sex, and the vicious of the other  After she had hung<br>the usual time ,  her body was taken down and conveyed to the College for dossection.<p>Mrs, M'Kinnon was elegantly dressed in a black silk gown, trummed with white<br>lace at the bottom. silk stockings, and white slippers  she  was betwixt 35 and 40<br>years of age, good looking and rather corpulent.  Her father at one time was quar-<br>ter master of the 79th regiment of foot  At a very carly  age she was debauched  by<br>an officer in the army,  under very atrocious circumstances; and  after that event her<br>family thrust her from under their roof, and totally abandoned her, to which cir-<br>cumstance may be attributed her after course of prefligate life&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<p>The crowd assembled on this lamentable occasion, wss unusually great at an ear-<br>ly hour the&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;High Street was crowded, and all the&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; windows tops of houses, and every<br>elevated place within view of the fatal  spot filled with spectators, so that it is<br>calculated  that not less than 30,000 people were present.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;John Muir Printer, Glasgow.<br></p>
