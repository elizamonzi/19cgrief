	<p> THE LAST<p>Words and Confession<p>o f<p>DAVID&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;MYLES<p>Who was Executed for Incest, at Edinburgh, on<br>the 27 Day of November,  1702.<p>DAvid Myles, having commited Incest with his Sister Margaret Myles, both<br>were Condemn'd to be Hanged : the Woman upon the Twentieth and the<br>Man upon the twenty Seventh of November,  She Dyed very obduredly and<br>Obstinately, and gave little or no satisfaction to the Spectators ; But he (a<br>young man, not 2o years) dyed very Seriously and Christianly; for when<br>he was brought to the place of Execution, Mr. James Heart Exhorted to Re-<br>pentance, and now at his last Hour to confess, what he had to say, concerning<br>his Crime before the People. Whereupon he went to the Eastern end of the<p> scaffold, and said, Good People, give ear a while, I now confess before you<br>all, That I was a very bad Liver, and a great Sabbath breaker, and not only a<br>Sabbath breaker, but also a Swearer and Blasphemer of the Holy Name of GOD;<br>and Guilty both of Incest and Fornication. I got a very ill Example from my<br>Parents; Therefore I desire all you that are Parents to give a good Copy to<br>your Children and desire that you would all pray to GOD for me; Where-<br>upon the Auditors cryed out, Lord have Mercy upon his Soul ; And Mr. Heart<br>Prayed to this purpose, viz. That God would give him a sight of his Sins, and<br>open a Door of Mercy to him  and that the infinit Goodness might speedily pre-<br>vent him, &c. Then he sung the first 4 Verses of the 51  Psalm : which being<br>done, he went to the Western end of the Scaffold, and earnesily prayed to GOD,<br>to pardon all his sins, to wash him, and cleanse him from all his Iniquities, thro-<br>his mercy, and with the Blood of  Jesus Christ his Saviour: and that  he was un-<br>worthy to come before so holy a GOD, for he was a great Sinner and Transgres-<br>sor: His Sins were great and many, but tho' he was weary and heavy laden, yet<br>hoped he would find Rest; and tho' his Body suffered upon the Gibbet, yet he<br>hoped his soul would go to Glory, &c. Then he went up the Ladder, and weep-<br>ing sore, entreated the Spectators to take warning by him, and avoid Sin, left<br>they fall in the same snare. Then he said, O ye that are Parents of Children,<br>God grant ye may cast them a better Copy than ever I got; And all ye that are<br>young folk, who have your Years before your hands, seek God, and fly all Sin,<br>for one Sin brings on another O all of you that see me this day, Take warning<br>by me, and put up your petitions to God for me. Then Mr Heart prayed ear-<br>nestly for him again ; who, when be had done, enquired at him if he was wil-<br>ing to dye ? He answe ed, Ay, ay, I am very willing: my Offence is great, very<br>great: I do not deserve nor desire to live, for I deserve both Torment here, and<br>Torment hereafter : I am very weary of my Sins. Being enquired at, if he<br>thought his Sentence just? or if he pardoned the Judges? He answered, My<br>Sentence is very Just, I forgive the Judges, and all the World, and God forgive<br>them. Mr. Heart asked him, what hope he had of his going to Heaven, or which,<br>of the promises of the Bible he could lippen to, or rely upon. He answered, ma-<br>ny, many, but the particular places do not Strik me in the mind, at present,<br>Mr. Heart  said, you told me in prison, of that in the 11 of Matthew, Came un-<br>to me all ye that Labour, and are heavy Laden,and I will give you rest. whereupon<br>he said, I indeed am in Labour, and am heavy laden, but I hope God will give<br>me rest, and receive my Soul in Glory He confessed again, that he had been a<br>great Sabbath breaker : After which Mr.Heart recommended him to GOD.<p></p>
