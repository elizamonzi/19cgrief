	<p> Confession<p> OF EMOND.<p>In the Jail, on the day  after<br>toe received sentence of death.<p>The following is coppied from that spirited new<br>paper, the North Briton.<p>About 5 o'clock yesterday morning, Emond was<br>brought to the calton Jail from the Lock-up-house in<br>a hackney coach : on alighting and entering the outter<br>gate, and appearing to he in a very cheerful and com.<br>municative mood, with a great deal of levity and in his<br>manner and bearing, he was accosted by an individual<br>present as follows : ?<p> Emond, I think you oyght to drop that levity now.'<br>He replied, 'Mr?? I am happier now than I have<br>been since I was in jail.'<p>Mr-----then said, ' I hope yon are eased of a burden<p>by having made confession of the facts.' To which he<br>answered, ? I never denied them, but have to acknow-<br>ledge the justice of God in all things.'<p>Mr-----then said, '  Emond&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;are you guilty of the<p>murders or not? He replied in the affirmative; I<br>am the man who comnitted the murders, for which 1<br>am so justly condemned.'<p>He several times repeated the words.' God is just<br>in alll his ways ' with reference to his own case; this<br>took place on his way from the gate to his cell,<p>After the trial was over a bed was made down for<br>him ; on his entering the cell and looking at the bed,<br>be said, ' I suppose you have been prepared for me<br>during the day. He was answered ' Not so ; the pre-<br>parations have only be a made since the trial was<br>concluded. He then submitted very quietly to be<br>roned. During this appaling conversation his firm-<br>ness and self-possession countinued unshaken, and he<br>slept soundly for several hours thereafter.<p>We also extract the following from the same paper;<br>when Emond left the Court he remained silent till he<br>bad entered the Lock-up. house, when he begged the<br>turnkey for a draught of water, which was given him;<br>after which he asked for bread, which he also got and<br>ate greedily. He then demanded this day's aliment, to<br>purchase pens, ink, and paper, and after some talk<br>with Christie the turnkey, received sixpence in lieu of<br>it He exclaimed much against the evidence of Tait<br>saying, he never made such a declaration as that fal-<br>low swore to, to any person on earth, or until that<br>moment when he acknowledged his guilt and said<br>he felt much relieved in consequence; adding 1 am<br>now resigned to my fate.'<p>He ascribed his ruin chiefly to a haberdasher in the<br>Southside. who. he believed. was the cause of the mis-<br>chief between him and his wife ; hut he had determin-<br>ed to publish the whole history of the case, as well as<br>how the murders were done, and the greet provocation<br>he got. Nothing, he said, grieved him so much as the<br>thought of his poor mother, who lives in Selkirk, and<br>is now upwards of fourscore, as he was sure his un-<br>happy fate would bring her to the grave. He had also<br>a brother, he said, for whom he was very sorry. While,<br>eating nis bread he observed, "You may perhaps<br>think I am a hardened man, but you are mistaken, I<br>am not ; and although there can bo no pardon in my<br>case from man, there is pardon from the Almighty,<br>and to that I trust."<p>' Emond is about 5 feet 7, of rather a slender make,<br>very near sighted, about 36 years of age, and a native<br>of Selkirk ; his look on the whole is sullen and forbid.<br>den. He bad been In the army fo rsome time, and on<br>being discharged, opened a school in Selkirk which<br>did not succeed. He then commenced as travelling<br>Merchant and is well known in the border towns,<br>was generally thought both steady and honest in bis<br>dealings; he got married, had a shop in North Sunder-<br>land previously to his removal to North Berwick,<br>where be resided when be was taken into custody.</p>
