	<h2>Transcription</h2>
	<p> A Full and Particular  Account, of the Great Battle<br>between JOHNSON and HALTON, on Monday the 7th<br>March,1825, in a Field, 12 Miles  west of Edin-<br>burgh, for Fifty Pounds sterling.<p>YESTERDAY being the time appointed  for this momentous en-<br>counter, and being Saint Monday  besides, every son of<br>Crispin, and every knight of shrens and patches was early on the<br>more for Winchburgh, lrishman fight for pleasure, Englishmen for '<br>fame, and Scotchmen when they can't help it. The last love to look<br>on however. The place of rendezvous,through fear of unchivalrous<br>beaks, had been kept a profound secret to all but the knowing ones.<br> In the morning, however, the humbler friends of the fancy scented<br>the odour of preparation. The circle action was a comfortable lea<br>field, on the farm of kirkland on the souchren bank of the Union<br>Canal, nearly midway between Winchburgh and Broxburn. The<br>ground was soon covered by an immense concourse of spectators.<br>All sorts of drags were in tremendous requisition, from the potent<br>chariot and four, followed by unnumbered pupils of the quoniam at-<br>tachiamenta down the humble apple cart of our Irish hucksters. Not<br>a few of the peepers were of rank enough to feel queer should they<br>have been suspected of any vulgar predilection for a mill. But the<br>love of claret levels all distinctions. At a few minutes before two<br>o'clock, Gypsey Johnson threw his castor into the ring with the air<br>of a Hector, amidst the applauses of thousands. His second imme-<br>diately attached his ensign, in the shape of a blue Belcher, to the<br>ropes of the ring. In ten minutes after, Halton, au ugly carrotty<br>cropped Potatoe, made his bow, and was received with similiar plau-<br>dits. His second unfurled a green wipe, in honour of the grassy<br>bills of his country Both men, on peeling, seemed prime meat,<br>Johnson carried at least a eouple of stones more than Hallon. But<br>Paddy was a perfect Longimanus ; his feelers being about the dimen-<br>sions of a couple of ordinary flails. The candidates having skyed a<br>copper for the sun, came to the scratch at two o'clock.<p>Round 1.?Johnson opened the budget but seemed queerish ; act-<br>ing on the defence ; made the periphery of the ring. Halton came<br>up, however, and tipped  him a touch on the trunk; this was well<br>met and returned by a teaser on the capitol, which Halton .gracious-<br>ly acknowledged by an instaneous prostration, Johnson above. Old<br>England for ever.<p>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A short round.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Jolmson shewed first claret from the snot-<br>-cock; a smart rally;  some tolerable weaving; much outerhouse<br>practice, both down, Gypsey; undermost.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Huzza for Old Ireland.<p>3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Halton tried an experiment on the Gypsey's puddingbag; but<br>the enemy was too quick for him.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Johnson tried a return ; but the<br>compliment waa met by a tap on the magazine, that hurled him out<br>of the ring.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  Johnson kissed the sod beyond the ropes.?The Hill<br>of Howth to a frosted potatoe for Pat.<p>4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Halton examined the Gypsey phrenologically ; felt him on the<br>mount of bumps ; Johnson shy and retiring in his habits.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  Hal-<br>ton, however, wanted pluck, and did not go in.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A good deal of<br>straggling play, but no game.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At lenth both down, Johnson up-<br>permost.?Well done Gypsey ; that's a presser.<p>5.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  A well contested round, and lasted four minutes.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  Jonnson<br>still fighting shy, followed round the ring by Halton, who got his<br>dexter ogle obnubilated by a discharge from Johnson's maniple.?<br>Hurra for Johnson ; come it quick, and you'll win.<p> 6. Johnson alive ; made good play : sent a shaker after Patrick's<br>knowledge box. Pat shyed the favour, however, and caught the com-<br>pliment on his shoulder; Halton turned quaker; a sharp rally;<br>both down, Johnson under.?Shouts for either.<p>7.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Johnson aimed a tremendous corporation hit; Pat returned by<br>a facer : both turfish.<p>8.  and 9.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Lots of sparring, but no harm ; both down.<p>10. A hard fought round; Pat, put in his favourite facer, and<br>stopped a right-handed return from Johnson. Halton punished<br>his adversary round the ring, close to the ropes. The Gypsey made<br>a desperate effort. The enemy skulked, but the suspension was re-<br>fused, with costs against Halton. Johnson fell from a tingler on<br>the left Ing, that rendered him deaf to time. Halton was proclaim-<br>ed victor, with small punishment.<p>This terminated the battle, certainly much to the disappointment<br>of the gapers. It was hinted that they had seen a better mill be-<br>tween a brace of haddy wives,. The fight lasted only twenty mi-<br>nutes. Johnson seemed more exhausted; and neither were hurt.<br>Some hints went round of a cross. Halton is an open flighter and<br>a good man. Johnson was either very cool or much afraid. He<br>does not stand firm on his pins, but was continually shifting his<br>ground. Good order and humour prevailed ; the bets were few;<br>Sawney afraid of being called on to fork the blunt.</p>
