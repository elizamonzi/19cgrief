	<p> Trial & Sentence<p>Of JAMES BRYCE, labourer, Airdrie, for<p>the Horrid Murder of JOHN GEDDES.<p>HIGH COURT OF  JUSTICIARY.<p>Edinburgh,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tuesday, March 12th,  1844.<p>JAMES BRYCE, labourer, Airdrie, was<br>this day placed at the bar, charged with the<br>murder of his brother-in-law, John Geddes,<br>within his own house on the farm of Long-<br>ford, in the parish of West Calder, on the<br>night of Tuesday the 26th or morning of<br>Wednesday the 27th of December last, by<br>barbarously striking him repeated blows on<br>the head and other parts of the body with a<br>pair of tongs, or other lethal weapon, where-<br>by his skull was fractured, his left eye knock-<br>ed in, his eye-brow broken, his nose com-<br>pletely shattered, his jaw-bone and collar-<br>bone broken, his ribs all broken but two, and<br>his body otherwise shockingly mutilated, in<br>consequence of which he immediately or soon<br>thereafter died,?also with the Robbery of<br>two Silver Watches, at least £5 in half-crown<br>pieces, and a quantity of his body-clothes.<p>The atrocious character of this murder na-<br>turally eveited feelings of the deepest horror ;<br>and, from a desire to obtain a sight of him<br>who was considered the hardened wretch  to<br>perpetrate such a drcadful crime,  the court-<br>room was  densely crowded long before pro-<br>ceedings&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;commenced,--and&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;numbers&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;were<br>unabla to get admittance.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The pannel, who<br>is of a morose and sulky appearance, on being<br>interrogated on the indictment, pleaded Not<br>Guilty.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Evidence was then led whieh went<br>to establish that, on Tuesday the 26th De-<br>cember Geddes was in his usual health, and<br>same night words were heard  between  him<br>and some one in his&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;house ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;that, missing<br>him for some days, his neighbours  became<br>alarmed, and broke open the door on Sunday<br>the 31st, when they discovered his body lying<br>on the floor in the mangled state discribed,<br>covered with a shirt,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and the tongs by the<br>fire-side besmeared with blood :&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That Bryce<br>was seen going towards West Calder on the<br>Tuesday afternoon, also returning to Airdrie<br>next day carrying a large bundle, where he<br>had plenty of money, and purchased  clothes<br>for himself  and family,  and to some of his<br>friends on Thursday produced a watch which<br>was recognised as deceased's, and which was<br>afterwards pawned by his wife in an office in<br>Glasgow ; that, having  absconded on New-<br>Year's-Day,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;after  eluding an&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;active<br>search, he was apprehended near Dumfries<br>on the 12th, when he gave a false account<br>of himself; and that he was found wearing<br>deceased's body-belt, while his son had also<br>on his shoes.------The Court then adjourned<br>till Wednesday morning, when<p>The Solicitor-General addressed the Jury<br>on the part of the prosecution, claiming from<br>them a verdict of Guilty. Mr Crauford fol-<br>lowed on behalf of the pannel, insisting that<br>on such circumstantial evidence as had been<br>led no conviction could follow, and demand-<br>ing at least a verdict of Not Pro. en. The<br>Lord-'ustice-Clerk then summed up theevi-<br>dence in his usual minute and judicious man-<br>ner, and the Jury retired. On their return<br>into Court, in about half-an-hour, with a ver-<br>dict of Guilty of the Murder and Robbery as<br>libelled, his Lordship having assumed the<br>fatal black cap, in a solemn and impressive<br>address to the prisoner, passed upon him the<br>last awful sentence of the law, to be carried<br>into effect on Wednesday the 3d April next.<p>Sandarson, Printer,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Edinburgh.</p>
