	<p> CHRISTS&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;KIRK ON THE GREEN,<p>Composed ( as is supposed) by King JAMES the fifth,<p>WAS never in Scotland heard not seen<br>such dancing nor deray,<br>Neither at Faulkland on the green,<br>nor Peebles at the play,<br>As was (of wooers as I ween)<br>at Christs-Kirk on day ;<br>For there came Kittie washen clean ,<br>in her new gown of gray<br>so gay that day.<p>To dance these Damosels them dight,<br>these Lasses light of laits ,<br>Their gloves were of the Rassall right.<br>their shies  were of the struts :<br>Their kittles were of Lincoln light,<br>well prest with many plaits,<br>They were so nice when men them neight,<br>they squiel'd like any gaits,<br>full loud that day.<p>Of all these maidens mild as meed,<br>Was none so gimp as Gillies,<br>As any rose her rude was red,<br>her lyre was like the Lillie;<br>But yellow, yellow was her head,<br>and she of love so silly,<br>Though all her kin had sworn her dead,<br>she would have none but Willie,<br>alone that day;<p>She scorned Jock, and skripped at him<br>and murgeon'd him with mocks,<br>He would have lov'd her, she would not let him,<br>for all his yellow locks;<br>He cherisht her, she bade go chat him:<br>She counted him not two clocks,<br>So shamefully his short Jack set him,<br>his legs were like twa rocks,<br>or rungs that day.<p>Tom Luter was their Minstrell meet,<br>good Lord, how he could lance,<br>He play'd so shrill, and sang so sweet,<br>while Tousie took a trance<br>Old Light-foot there he could forleet,<br>and counterfitted France,<br>He held him like a man discreet,<br>and up the Morice-dance<br>he took  that day.<p>Then Steven came stepping in with stends,<br>no rink might him arrest,<br>Splay-foot did bab with many bends,<br>for Masie he made request,<br>He lap while he lay on his lends,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  <br>and rising to was preast <br>While he did host at both the ends,<br>for honour of the feast,<br>and dance that day,<p>Then Robin Roy began to revell,<br>and Towsie to him drugged:<br>Let be (quoth Jock) and call'd him J<br>and by the tail him tugged.<br>Then Kensie clieked to Kevell,<br>God wots if they two lugged:<br>They parted there upon a nevell.<br>men say, that hair was rugged<br>between them twa,<p>With that a friend of his cry'd Fie,<br>and forth an arrow drew,<br>He forged it so forcefully,<br>the bow in flinders flew,<br>Such was the grace of God, trow I;<br>for had the tree been true,<br>Men said, who knew his archery,<br>that he had slain anew<br>belyve that day.<p>A yape young-man that stood him niest,<br>soon bent his bow in ire,<br>And etled the bairn in at the breast,<br>the bolt flew ov'r the byre,<br>And cry'd, Fy, he had slain a Priest.<br>a myle beyond the myre:<br>Both bow and bag from him he kiest,<br>and fled as fast as fire<br>from flint that day.<p>An hastie kinsman, called Hary,<br>that was an archer keen,<br>Tyed up a tackell withoutten cary,<br>I trow the man was tien.<br>I Wot not whether his hand did vary<br>or his foe was friend,<br>But he eleaped by the might of Mary,<br>as one that nothing mean'd<br>but good that day.<p>Then Lawrie, like a Lyon lap,<br>and soon a slain can fedder,<br>He height to pelrce him at the pape,<br>thereon to wed a wedder:<br>He hit him on the womb a wap,<br>it busst like any bladder,<br>He louped so such was his hap,<br>his doublet was of leather<br>full fine that day.<p>The buss to boisterously abaist him<br>that he to th'earth dusht down,<br>The other man for dead then left him;<br>and fled out of the town.<br>The wives came  forth, and up they rest him,<br>and found like in the lown,<br>Then with three routs there they rais'd him,<br>and cured him out of swoun<br>fra hand that day.<p>The Miller was of manly make,<br>to meet with him it was no mower,<br>There durst no ten some there him take,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>so cowed he their power;<br>The Bushment whole about him brake,<br>and bickered him with bowes,<br>Then traiterously behind his back<br>they hacked him on the howes<br>behind that day.<p>Then Hutchen, with an hazell rice,<br>to red gan through them rummill,<br>He muddled them down like any mice,<br>he was so bettie bummil:<br>Though he was wight, he was not wise<br>with Such Jutors to jummil,<br>For from his thumb there flew a slyce,<br>while he cry'd Barls summil.<br>I'm slain this day.<p>When that he saw his bloud was red,<br>to flie might no men let him:<br>He trow'd it had been for old feed,<br>he thought, and bade have at him:<br>He made his feet defend his head,<br>the far fairer it set him:<br>While he was past out of their plead,<br>they must be swift that got him<br>through speed that day.<p>Two that were headsmen of the herd<br>they rusht on other like rams:<br>The other four which were unfear'd<br>beat on with barrow trams.<br>And where their gobs were ungear'd,<br>they got upon the gams,<br>While that all bloud burn was their berd<br>as they had worried lambs<br>most like that day.<p>They girn'd and glowred all at anes,<br>each Gossip other grieved,<br>Some striked stings, some gathered stanes,<br>some fled, and some relieved,<br>Their Minstrell used quiet means,<br>that day he wisely prieved:<br>For he came home with unbirs'd  banes,<br>where fighters were mischieved<br>full ill that day.<p>With forks and flails then let they slaps,<br>and flew together with frigs:<br>With bougers of barns they pierc't blew caps,<br>while of their bairns they made brigs.<br>The reer rose rudely with their raps,<br>then rungs were laid on rigs:<br>The wives came forth with cryes and claps,<br>see where my liking ligs<br>full low this day.<p>The black Sutar of Braith was bowden,<br>his wife hung by his waist:<br>His body was in black all browden,<br>he girned like a ghaist,<br>Her glittering hair that was so gowden<br>her love fast for him laist,<br>That for his sake he was unyouden,<br>while he a mile was chast,<br>and more that day.<p>When they had bier'd like baited buls;<br>the bone fires burnt like bails,<br>They grew at meek as any Mules,<br>that wearied are with mails:<br>For these forfoughten tyred fools,<br>fell down like slaughtered flails,<br>Fresh men came in and hail'd their dools,<br>and dang them down in dails<br>bedeen that day.<p>The wives then gave a hideous yell,<br>when all these younkiers yocked,<br>As fierce as flags of fire-Saughts fell<br>fricks to the field they flocked:<br>Then Kailes with clubs did other quell<br>on breast while blood out bocked,<br>So ludely rang the common Bell,<br>that all the Steeple rocked<br>for dread that day.<p>By this Tom Tailyour was in his gear <br>when he heard the common Bell,<br>He said he should make them all on steer<br>when he came their him sell:<br>He Went to fight with such a fear,<br>while to the ground he fell,<br>A wife, that hit him on the ear,<br>with a great knocking mell,<br>feld him that day<p>The Bride groom brought a pint of aile<br>and bade the Pyper drink it:<br>Drink it (said he)and it so staile,<br>ashrew me if I think it,<br>The Bride her Maidens stood near by,<br>and said it was not blinked<br>And Bartagasie the Bride so gay<br>upon him last she winked <br>full soon that day.<p>When all was done Dick with an ax<br>came forth to fell a fother,<br>Quoth he, where are yon whoorson smaiks,<br>right now that hurt my brother?<br>His wife bade him, go home, Gib glaiks,<br>and so did Meg his mother:<br>He turn'd and gave them both their paike,<br>for he durst ding no other<br>but them that day.<p>F  I&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;N&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;S.</p>
