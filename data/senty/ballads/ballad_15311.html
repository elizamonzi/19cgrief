	<p> A TRUE ACCOUNT OF THAT<p>FATAL DUEL<p>Which took place on Tuesday morning 26th March,<br>1822. beween, Sir Alexander Boswell Bart. and<br>James Stuart Esq. in Fife when Sir Alexander<br>was mortally wounded, and died on Wednesday.<p>WE are deeply concerned to state, that a meeting took place on Tuesday<br>morning about ten o'clock, at Auchtertool, in Fife, between Sir Alex-<br>ander Boswell, Bart, of Auchinleck, attended by the Honourable John Douglas,<br>brother to the Marquis of Queensberry, and James Stuart, Esq. of Dunearn,<br>attended by the Earl of Rosslyn. The parties both fired by signal, when Sir<br>Alexander was mortally wounded in the right shoulder, the ball shattring the<br>collar bone; but on the most minute examination, its course fterwards could<br>not be discovered.<p>Sir Alexander was carried to Balmuto house, where he died on Wednesday<br>afternoon at three o'clock.<p>An erroneous account having appeared of the manner in which Mr Stuart<br>got possession of some papers, proving that Sir Alexander Boswell was the<br>author of the numerous attacks in the Glasgow Sentinel against Mr Stuart, we<br>are desired to state, that Mr Stuart some time ago raised an action of dam-<br>ages agaisnt Messrs Bothwick and Alexander, the proprietors of the Sentinel.<br>On one of the last days of the Session, a gentleman from Hamilton, (the<br>country agent of Mr Bothwick) came to Mr Stuart, and stated that Mr Both-<br>wick was extremely desirous of having the action settled, and asked Mr Stuart<br>if he was inclined to do so. Mr Stuart answered, that would depend on the<br>communications made to him. The gentleman said Mr Bothwick was in jail<br>in Glasgow, for a debt which he (the agent) was going to discharge, and that<br>Mr Bothwick would produce all the papers in his possession. Mr Stuart<br>did not agree to any settlement of the action, but having been long extremely<br>anxious to find out. The Authors of the attacks upon him, he went to Glas-<br>gow ; and Mr Bothwick after being liberated from prison, brought a number<br>of papers and put them into the hands of his Edinburgh agent, who was then<br>at an hotel along with Mr Stuart. Among these that gentleman and Mr<br>Stuart to their utter astonishment, found in the hand writing of Sir Alexander<br>Boswell (who had never been suspected,) the papers which led to the fatal<br>reneountre. Mr Stuart neither paid, nor agreed to pay, any part of the debt<br>for which Mr Bothwick was imprisoned ; he neither paid, nor agreed to pay,<br>Mr Bothwick any money and he never was in the office of the Sentinel from<br>which he understood the papers were brought. We understand that Mr Stuart<br>has given notice ,that he is ready to appear to stand his trial.</p>
