	<h2>Transcription</h2>
	<p> The Ball of Dandyorum.<p>This very comical song was written and sung by J. Kearney, in the character<br>of 'Owney,' at the Castle Tavern, Dublin ; and so great is the thirst for it in<br>Scotland, that hourly are the walls of the Box echoing with lots of young chaps<br>crying out for 'Dandyorum.'  Till now the Poet could never get hold of it ; but<br>now that the Yankee and the steam power of Billy has got hold of it, all can get <br>Dandyorum from the usual place, Poet's Box, No. 6, St Andrew's Lane, off Gal-<br>lowgate Street, Glasgow.<p>AIR- The Rakes o' Mallow.<p>All you that are here attend, I pray,<br>And you shall hear, without delay,<br>About a party great and gay,<br>The type of all decorum<br>The nobility met one and all,<br>Last week, down in the Music Hall,<br>At a Masquerade and Fancy Ball,<br>That was gave by Dandyorum.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tooral ooral, &c<p>Large  placards soon the fun announced,<br>The ladies got their gowns well flounced ,<br>And as through jigs and reels they bounced,<br>Like ribbons they all tore 'em<br>Michael's Lane, and Meath Street too,<br>Was search'd for clothes, black, brown, and blue,<br>To dress this awful motley crew<br>For the ball of Dandyorum.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tooral ooral  &c <p>For tickets they had such demand,<br>His committee soon had it planned<br>To go and engage with Jullien's band,<br>They sent them off  before 'em<br>They made me Usher of the Rod,<br>Till the lush began to make me nod,<br>Then on the buniony toes I trod<br>On the moth of Dandyorum.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tooral ooral, &c<p>Zozimus came drest as a Turk,<br>Peg the man was Paddy from Cork,<br>Lord Howth, as a tinker, wanted work,<br>He tied my bib before him<br>A quadrille or waltz he'd not go through,<br>But he roared for kettles old or new;<br>When he got no hammering to do,<br>He hammered Dandyorum.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tooral ooral, &c<p>There were oyster  men and cockle pickers,<br>Snibs was watching all our tickers ,<br>Spaniards, Turks, and herring-feckers<br>Dancing Tullochgorum.<p>Major White and Mickey Maw  <br>Were dressed as two limbs of the law,<br>With clients they kept up such jaw,<br>I complained to Dandyorum.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tooral ooral, &c<p>Dandyorum called them two blackguards,<br>That  led to an exchange of cards,<br>They brought pistols down to one of the yards<br>But first they drank a jorum<br>They pulled the triggers bold and stout,<br>But devil a bullet would come out,<br>They were loaded both with stirabout<br>By the friends of Dandyorum.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tooral ooral, &c<p>The Major's shot took no effect,<br>But Dandy's hit him in the neck,<br>And left his clothes a pretty spec,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>With the stirabout all o'er him<br>When Mickey seen the Major's job,<br>For spite he tore his foolish nob,<br>And he swore by his martial slipper gob<br>He'd swallow Dandyorum.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tooral ooral, &c<p>The report of both the pistol shots<br>Frightened the life out of all the moths,<br>They ran, and down went pans and pots,<br>That was making up the jorum<br>The Music Hall began to fill<br>With Peelers, and to show their skill,<br>To the station house, their last quad-rille,<br>Was led by Dandyorum.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tooral ooral,  &c<p>In the morning we were marched in state<br>Before the sitting magistrate,<br>And the Peeler that was on the beat<br>Showed how the moths all tore him<br>Old Bag-wig says, you've broke the peace,<br>You must get a run in the Bastile chaise,<br>To round the rack for fourteen days-<br>O,  more luck! says Dandyorum.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tooral oeral,  &c<p>This funny song, along with thousands of others, can only be had from the Poet out of his Box, No. 6,<br>St Andrew's Lane, off Gallowgate Street, Glasgow.  Bear in mind to come there, for the Poet is now away<br>from his old Box, it being very meanly and very shabbily taken over his head.<p>But all say they would rather see the Poet in his New Box, for they have more room by far, so then<br>come all to the New Box, No. 6,  St  Andrew's Lane, off Gallowgate Street, Glasgow.<br>2d June 1851</p>
