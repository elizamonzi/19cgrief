	<h2>Transcription</h2>
	<p> A particular account of the Execution<br>of Hannah Halley, at Derby, on Mon-<br>day last, March, 26, 1822, for the in-<br>human Murder of her own new born<br>infant, by crushing it into a jug, and<br>pouring boiling water on it, with her<br>reasons for comitting  the barbarous act.<p>Extracted from the London Courier of the 29th March 1822.<p>LAST Friday, (22d instant,) Hannah Halley was tried before<br>Mr Justice Best for the wilful murder of her infant child, in<br>the month of August last. The evidence adduced in support of<br>this accusation was conclusive, not merely as to the fact, but also<br>the intention.<p>She was residing in lodgings at a house in Brook-Strcet in this<br>town, and about a quarter before nine in the morning of Tuesday, <br>August 14th, passed thro' the lower room or house place, where<br>her landlady and another female were sitting. They observed to<br>her that she seemed very poorly, to which she replied,  ' I  am,' and<br>went up stairs to her own apartment.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Soon after this the cry of a<br>child was heard by the women of the house, and on going into the<br>prisoners room, appearances warranted them in charging her with<br>being just delivered.  She denied the imputation with great con-<br>fidence,  but was observed to put under the bed a jug, which she<br>had previously been anxious to conceal under her clothes. As she<br>persisted in denying that a child had been born, one of the women<br>threatened to fetch a constable to apprehend her if she did not<br>give up the babe.  This threat being repeated, and the woman<br>actually leaving the room for the purpose she had stated, the pri-<br>soner rose from the bed on which she was sitting, and followed her<br>to the top of the stairs. The other female took that opportunity<br>of drawing the jug from under  the bed, and on removing a coarse cloth<br>with which it was covered, found within it a new-born child. On ex-<br>amining the infant it was perocived to be dreadfully scalded, and in such a<br>manner as to produce the conviction, that boiling water had been poured<br>upon it after it had been thrust into the jug.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not with standing this treat-<br>ment the child lived till the following Saturday, the 18th of August, when<br>it died in consequence of the injury inflicted upon it by its unnatural<br>mother.  That it was her intention to destroy the infant was inferred from<br>her constant denial of her pregnancy, ( except on the day prior to her<br>delivery, when she admitted that she was three months advanced.<p>She could not plead ignorance of her real situation as she had born a child<br>fibe yearr ag) ; but she had allowed herself to marry only about seven<br>weeks before het delivery to a man who knew not her condition and who<br>was not the father of the child she meditated to destroy.<p>During her long imprisonment she conducted herself with<br>propriety, but much of her behaviour must be referred to the<br>hope, which she indulged to the very day of her trial that she<br>should escape. To this feeling also must be traced the solemn<br>asservations of her innocence made when the Judge was about<br>to pass upon her the dreadful sentence of the law. All hope of<br>impunity ,  however, being cut off she hastened to relieve her over-<br>burdened mind by a full confession of her guilty purpose, and of<br>the means by which she intended to carry it into effect, thus<br>confirming the evidence adduced against her on her trial in its<br>full extent.<p> The brief interval between her sentence and execution, she passed<br>chiefly in devotional exercises with  the  worthy  Chaplain of  the<br>Goal, and a Minister of the religious denomination to which she<br>had formally attached herself ; in taking leave of her friends, and<br>in mental  preparation  for  the  awful scene  which  lay  boforo  her<br>She slept little, from the time of her condemnation, but had about<br>three hours repose on on the night of Sunday last.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Her frame was<br>feeble, and acted upon as it had been by the consciousness of her<br>situation, when the  time  arrived for her execution, she was weak<br>and pale and powerless.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Still she ascended the steps which led<br>to the fatal platform with more firmness than&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;was&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;anticipated,<br>and when brought out upon the drop she behaved  with  becoming<br>fortitude. After the usual time spent in prayer, in which she join-<br>ed  the chaplain with apparent devotions, the platform fell, and she<br>died with scarcely a struggle.<p> Hannah Halley was 31 years of age, and was a native of May field in Staffordshire,<br> At the time of her marriage and of her committing the Crime for which she has paid<br> the forfeiture of life, she was living in Derby, and worked at the cotton-mill Darley<p> After hanging the usual time, the body was taken down and given to the surgeons<br> for dissection.</p>
