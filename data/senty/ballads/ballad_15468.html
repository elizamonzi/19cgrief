	<h2>Transcription</h2>
	<p> Farther Particulars about William Pollock, who hang-<br>ed himself in the Jail of Edinburgh, on Monday the<br>20th March,1826, with his last Dying Declaration<br>in a Letter to a Gentleman the night before his death.<p>AS soon as the catastrophe was made known, the Governor dis-<br>patched notice of it to the Magistrates, and  sent for Dr<br>"Whyte, who arriving immediately, found all attempts to revive the<br>criminal would be hopeless, though there was some warmth in his<br>body.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A short time afterwards, Dr Black arrived, by which time<br>the body was cold.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pollock, down till the hour of his death, con-<br>tinued hardened and impenitent.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He received, it is true, the visits<br>of clergymen, and was sensible of their kindness.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On one occa-<br>sion, he said of Dr Lee and another gentleman who daily visited<br>him, that if it were possible to return from the invisible world, to<br>express his gratitude to them, he would do it.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On Sunday after-<br>noon, his daughter and sister were admitted to see him, and to take<br>their final leave of him, no person being present except the gentle-<br>men above alluded to and them.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The afternoon was spent in read-<br>ing and prayer, to which Pollock  shewed  nor the least attention.<br>Immediately on the devotional exercises being finished, and when<br>he was about to be separated from, his relatives, he got into a rage<br>about the injustice of his sentence, and exclaimed, " May Abraham<br>see me where he saw the rich man if I  be guilty of the crime in<br>the manner in which I am accused.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It maybe doubted whether he<br>had any sentiment of religion at all, though certainly he had some&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>knowledge of it.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Up to the hour of his death he denied the mur-<br>der of his wife, and often said  that he considered his fate cruel.<br>" Had I been accused of cutting her throat," said he, " had I been<br>accused of stabbing her in the breast, or in any other way, but to be<br>accused of perpetrating it in a manlier in which a cannibal would<br>shudder, is more than human nature can bear."&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In alluding to his<br>body not being allowed burial, he said, " How dreadful is it that<br>my poor children cannot go to the church-yard and say, there lies<br>the remains of our father,....that l am even denied the burial of an<br>.ass."&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So far from allowing any of those connected with the Jail to<br>suspence that he would commit suicide, be frequently appeared hor-<br>rifled at death, and often  inquired&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if mere  was  no possibility of<br>.saving his life,for lie would submit to dungeons, chains, and any<br>privations, if his life might be but spared.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pollock left behind him<br>an inventory .of his clothes, appended to  which is a brief bequest<br>.of them to his son James ; also three letters, severally addressed to<br>Dr Lee, to Governor Young of the Jail, and to Wilson the upper<br>turnkey.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the first, he thanks the reverend Doctor for his atten-<br>tion towards him.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the one to Governor Young, he writes,  Ex-<br>cuse this rash act.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When you consider all, you will see that there<br>are good intentions, though not towards myself.'&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The letter to the<br>ripper turnkey contains. ' I never could believe that I was the occa-<br>sion of my wife's death, and could not bear the idea of going to the<br>scaffold.'&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On Monday, a precognition of the circumstances con-<br>nected with this suicide, was taken by the Solicitor-General and the<br>agent.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pollock's son James, a lad of about 18 years of age, called<br>at the Jail on Monday about mid-clay, to take a last farewell of his<br>father.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When informed of his death, he seemed pleased ; but when<br>the nature of it was explained to him, he appeared equally shocked.<p>Up to Wednesday afternoon, no relations had appeared to claim<br>the body of Pollock, and it was buried by order of the Magistrates<br>in the course of the evening.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The sentence of the court not hav-<br>ing been carried into effect, the Professor of Anatomy has been de-<br>prived of a subject.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There was something very striking in the<br>manner in which Pollock's relatives in Glasgow became aware of<br>his having been accused and found guilty.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; His sister heard the<br>report of the trial called through the streets, and purchased a copy<br>because it was the trial of a namesake,?she had not before heard<br>of her brother being accused.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This sister visited him on Friday.<br>To her, as he bad done all along, he denied his guilt, although, from<br>the evidence on the trial, it was impossible for any one to doubt it.<br>To a gentleman to whom he was under considerable obligations, he,<br>wrote;...." I do declare that I am totally innocent of my wife's<br>death.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I admit that 1 gave her a kick with my foot, when she came home at ten<br>o'clock on: the evening of the 10th November, 1825, being rather irritated at her<br>conduct, having been from home the two preceding nights until midnight.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I farther<br>declare, that I had neither knife nor razor in my hand alter eight o'clock that night,<br>or a weapon of any description ; nor did I know of any thing being the matter with<br>her until one o'clock in the morning.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This I declare to be truth, as I shall answer<br>to God, before whom ia a few hours I must appear?March 19, 1826."<p>Printed for William Robertson, Price One Penny.</p>
