	<h2>Transcription</h2>
	<p> The Lover's Discussion.<p>As I walked out one evening in the month of May,<br>The flowers they were springing the lambs did sport and play;<br>I heard a couple talking, as they walked hand in hand;<br>For to hear their conversation I eagerly did stand.<p>John says, I am a Roman Catholic, that ne'er denied my faith,<br>He says I am a Heretic, being of the Saxon race;<br>To hear how they performed I listened in a bush,<br>He says to her my charmer I thought I had my wish.<p>She says to him dear Johnny, tell me what do you mean,<br>That I will dear Nancy, and soon to you explain ;<br>To become a Roman Catholic as I now describe,<br>For I fear you are a Heretic that never was baptized.<p>Nancy in a passion flew, and this to him did say,<br>If you say I'm a Heretic young man, you may go your way,<br>for I am as loyal to my church, as you are to your creed,<br>So therefore be contented I am of the proper seed.<p>How can you say said, Johnny, you are of the proper seed,<br>That sprung from Bess and Harry, who enacted wicked deeds ;<br>It was Luther's Reformation that left yon in the lurch,<br>Fordon't you know he was a Friar that faulted from our Church.<p>Nancy being quite angry which was not my desire,<br>She to him said, dear Johnny, I know he was a Friar;<br>He said the Roman creed was wrong, and that he was going astray.<br>Until an angel of the Lord had taught him the right way.<p>Your creed do worship images, and that is but little faith,<br>We adore no graven images of either white or black;<br>We adore no graven images of either red or blue,<br>But we keep it dear within our mind of what the Lord went through,<p>Your Creed do worship images and very much admire,<br>The same are in your Testament, don't say that I'm a liar;<br>The Unicorn and the Lion just, like two fighting bulls<br>Across the table of the law, boy Martin for John Bull.<p>Those dukes and officers, I tell you my dear,<br>That go before her Majesty, they do salute her chair.<br>Is that chair to be compared to the shepherd and his flock,<br>We have in our Holy Church built on St Peter's rock.<p>Don't talk to me about Peter, he had but little faith<br>He had denied his Master, the truth for to relate;<br>He had denied his Master, one night among the Jews,<br>so Johnny go no farther, his power's of little use.<p>Peter denied his Master, I'll tell you the reason why,<br>Our Lord himself foretold it, he never told a lie;<br>When Peter saw what he had done, he went and wept fall sore;<br>He has the Keys of Heaven, and will for evermore.<p>St. Peter was a Martyr, and died upon a tree<br>So did our blessed Saviour on the hill of Calvary;<br>So now my charming creature, I hope you will repent,<br>For I have ruled to you these reasons, from the blessed book of Trent.<p>Martin Luther did the same, there would be but one Creed,<br>He did the same as Judas did, as I presume indeed;<br>You may contradict me. and say I'm going too far,<br>For Luther sold the Holy Church, and fell a wicked star.<p>She says to him dear Johnny, if all yon say be true,<br>I see it is but folly to go so far with you;<br>I will forsake my former creed, though my friends will me disown,<br>And whilst I live I'll be content, and die in the Church of Rome.<p>Now to conclude and finish, the truth I will express<br>Unknown to friends and parents, one creed they do profess;<br>It she Was cruel-hearted at last she did resign,<br>so now she is converted, which was not her design.</p>
