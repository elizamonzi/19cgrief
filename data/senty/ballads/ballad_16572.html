	<h2>Transcription</h2>
	<p> An account of the Execution of these two unfortunate Young Men,<br>JAMES WILSON and JOHN M'DONALD, who were Hanged<br>at Glasgow on Wednesday the 4th of June, 1823, for Housebreak-<br>ing and Theft; with an account of their Behaviour in the prison<br>and at the place of Execution.<p>THIS day, JAMES WILSON and JOHN M'DON-<br>ALD, two unhappy criminals comdemned at [  ]<br>last Circuit Court here, for the crimes of housebreak-<br>ing and theft, underwent the awful sentence of the law<br>at the usual place of execution in front of the jail.<p>Wilson was convicted of robbing the house of Mr.<br>M'Arthur, engineer, York Street, of a great quantity<br>of wearing apparel, and of being a common thief.<br>Wilson's parents (or M'Lusky, for that was his proper<br>name) came to this country from the North of Ireland<br>about 20 years ago, and settled at Lochwinnoch, where<br>their unfortunate son was born. His parents living a<br>very unhappy life for some time and at last parted,<br>when James was left to shift for himself, and at a very<br>early period of life indulged in those baneful and covetous inclinations, which know neither<br>moral of religious restraint, and committed numerous depredations in various parts of the<br>country, for which be was often punished, having been no less than three different times<br>whipt since January last; but all had no effect in deterring him from the commission of crime.<p>M'Donald was convicted of breaking into the Shop of Moses Mosely jeweller, Candle- <br>riggs, and stealing 18 silver watches, and a variety of other articles.  On his trial he pleaded<br>Guilty, but the Public Prosecutor stated that as the crime had been commited by a person<br>habit and repute a common thief, he was under the painful necessity of letting the law take<br>its course.  He had served about 8 years in the navy where he bore the character of an able<br>seaman, and an honest man.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He was about 30 years of age, and belonged to the Calton.<p>The Magistrates entered the Court Hall soon after two o'clock, when the prisoners were<br>brought up, decently dressed, attended by the Rev. Dr. Gibb, and several other pious<br>and worthy individuals, when psalms were song a portion of scripture read, and prayers<br>pronounced in behalf of the dying men. They then returned their best thanks to the Ma-<br>gistrates, Ministers, and Mr. M'Grigor, the Jailor, for their Humanity and kindness during<br>their confinement About three o'clock they ascended the platform, where they again<br>spent a short time in prayer, and after the fatal cords were adjusted, a hand kerchief was<br>dropped as a signal that they were ready, and they were launched into the eternal world.<p>Address to the Spectators at the Execution.<p>Thus have two other fellow creatures paid the forfeit of their lives to the laws of their<br>country?their miserable death affords another awful proof of the end to which crime and<br>vice uniformly leads. May the present example under divine power, be a solemn warning<br>to many, and constrain the multitudes following, or commencing to follow similar courses,<br>to pause before it be too late. Let the most distant approaches to vice and crime be there-<br>fore shunned, " if evil men entice thee consent thou not," Those men who have this day<br>suffered the higest penalty of human law, would one day have shuddered alike at the crimes<br>they ultimately committed as at the awful punishment which, followed upon them. And<br>they and many others who have met a similar fate have traced their wretched end to youth-<br>ful Sabbath day breaking, to evil company and intemperence. If any one then be in this<br>path, the melancholy event speaks to them a lesson of dread import. Let him lose not a<br>moment in fleeing vice and seeking the sure paths of Religion and Honesty " whose ways<br>are ways of pleasantness, and all her paths are peace;"?and let every one recollect that all<br>mankind are under righteous condemnation, and that a sentence is pronounced against them<br>of a nature far more certain and awful than that inflicted this day---death eternal, not of the<br>body merely, but of the soul is decreed against all, "for all have sinned;" but will the sen-<br>tence, the gracious assurance of pardon be proclaimed to those who seek it in faith. To you<br>"now is the accepted time and now is the day of Salvation."<p>The men who this day suffered, had by the humane laws of their country a considerable<br>period afforded them to make up their peace with their God. Readers, your end may be<br>even worse than their's, for no such season may be afforded you, be up then, and doing<br>while yet it is called to day, for the night is at hand, in which no man can work, and the<br>Scriptures declareth "the wages of sin is death, but the gift of God life Eternal through<br>"Jesus Christ our Lord."&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <p>.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  Printed by John Muir, Glasgow.</p>
