	<p> EXECUTION.<p>A Full and Particular ACCOUNT of the Execution<br>of DAVID HAGGART, who was Hanged at Edin-<br>burgh, this morning Wednesday 18th July 1821,<br>for the Murder of THOMAS MORRIN, under<br>Jailor at Dumfries, on the, 10th of October last,<br>and his Body given to the Professor of Anatomy<br>for Dissection, together with his Behaviour at the<br>place of Execution.<p>THIS unfortunate young man, DAVID HAGGART, was tried<br>at Edinburgh, before the High Court of Justiciary and a re-<br>spectable Jury, on Monday the 11th of June last, and found guilty<br>art and part, of the Murder of Thomas Morrin, then under Turn-<br>key of the Jail of Dumfries, on Tuesday the 10th of October last,<br>by fracturing his skull with a stone in a bag, when he made his<br>escape from that prison. He was of a genteel and prepossessing<br>appearance, and his trial excited great interest, the court being<br>crowded to excess.<p>Before pronouncing the awful sentence of the law upon the pris-<br>oner, the Lord Justice Clerk said, that the common penalty due to<br>the unnatural crime of Murder the pannel could not hope to escape ;<br>but that there were circumstances in his case which pointed him<br>out especially for a public example; and that all Scotland might<br>know that the law would most decidedly avenge the violence done<br>to keepers of his Majesty's prisons, the court had doomed the pris-<br>oner to expiate his crime in the city of Edinburgh. His Lordship<br>strongly recommended him to call in the assistance of the ministers<br>of religion, cautioning him that, if he did not prepare himself by<br>prayer at the footstool of mercy, and by repentance of all his sins,<br>there was another and a more terrible day of reckoning reserved<br>for him in that state upon which he was about to enter. The sen-<br>tence of the Court was, that the prisoner be executed on Wednes-<br>day the 18th day of July, between the hour's of 8 and 10 o'clock<br>in the forenoon, and his body to be delivered up to the professors<br>of Anatomy in the University of Edinburgh. The unfortunate<br>prisoner preserved a steady composure throughout the whole trial,<br>and appeared at one time to be much moved during the passing of<br>this judgment.<p> The greatest part of his time since his condemnation has been<br>employed in reading and perusing the scriptures, in which he has<br>been continually assisted by the Chaplain of the Jail, the Reverend<br>Mr Porteous, by several others of the Reverend Clergymen of this-<br>city, and occasianolly by private individuals, to whose instructions<br>and admonitions he was very attentive. It is also said, that he had<br>caused a Sketch of his Life to be written, which will soon be pub-<br>lished, and which contains a great many curious incidents for so<br>short a period. He was perfectly resigned to his fate, and behaved<br>with great propriety during his last confinement, always appearing<br>penitent and grateful for any kindness or attention at any time<br>shown to him. The meeting with his father, on Tuesday eight<br>lays, who called on him at the Jail, was truly affecting. His mo-<br>ther is dead some time ago.<p>Late on Tuesday evening last, he was removed from the Calton<br>Jail to the Lock-up-House, where he spent the greater part of the<br>night in prayer and meditation, assisted by several friends. He<br>slept but very little, for a few hours, and was early waited on by<br>the Clergymen, who prayed, and also assisted him in his devotions.<br>About eight o'clock the two officiating magistrates, in their robes,<br>and with their rods of office in their hands, came into the Hall,<br>where one of the Clergymen again prayed fervently for a short<br>time, the unhappy man all the while appearing perfectly calm and<br>resigned. The Magistrates and the Clergymen, after the proper ar-<br>rangements were then made, accompanied him up Libberton Wynd,<br>attended by the City Officers, executioner, and a strong detachment<br>of Police officers, to the Scaffold.<p>Thus attended, he appeared on the platform, decently dressed,<br>about 20 minutes past eight, where a psalm was sung, in which he<br>appeared to join, and one of the Clergymen prayed for a short time.<br>He then bade farewell to those around him, and mounted the fatal<br>drop; while the executioner was adjusting the rope round his neck,<br>he was distinctly heard praying fervently for several minutes, when<br>he dropt the signal, and was instantly launched into the world of<br>spirits, a few minutes before nine o'clock, in presence of a great<br>multitude of spectators. After hanging about half an hour, the<br>body was cut down, and returned to the Lock-up-House, to be<br>given for Dissection.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;PRICE ONE PENNY.</p>
