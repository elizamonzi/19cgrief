	<p> Horrible<br>MURDER.<p>A true account of that horrible murder<br>that was committed at Kilsyth 12 miles<br>from Glasgow on Saturday, 6th April,<br>1822; when a young man in a cruel man-<br>ner murdered his own father, by stabbing<br>him in the belly with a large knife. <p>ON Saturday the 6th of April, 1822, a barbarous murder,<br>was committed at Kilsyth, 12, miles from Glasgow.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A<br>quarrel took place between a father and son, under the follow-<br>ing Circumstance :?<p>The father, coming into the house, found his son lying<br>drunk, and was angry with him. Some words ensued, but the<br>father, aware of the vindictive temper of his son when in that<br>state, left him and went out a littie distance from the house.<br>The son soon after got up, and seizing a large knife, which<br>he was accustomed in his drunken fits to wield, rushed out, and.<br>going straight forward to the place where his father stood, seiz-<br>ed him by the throat with one hand, while he made three deep<br>stabs into his parent's bowels with the knife which he held in<br>the other hand. The poor man who had some distance to walk,<br>reached his house with difficulty, literally carrying in hands part<br>of his bowels, which had obtruded through the wounds.<p>The cruel monster fled,but had the savage hardihood to re-<br>turn on Sunday, go into the house; and survey, the dead body of<br>his murdered father, without apparent emotion .<p>The murderer has for the moment escaped, but the officers of<br>juitice are in search of him.<p>Drunknness is a vice that has very fatal effects on the mind,<br>the body, and the fortune of the person who is devoted to it,<br>The sober man, by the strength of reason, may keep under and<br>subdue every vice or folly to which he is most inclined; But<br>drunkenness, makes every latent seed spring up in the soul, and<br>show itself; it gives fury to the passions, and force to those ob-<br>jects which are apt to produce them.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It often turns the good-<br>natured man into an idiot, and the choleric into an assassin.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It<br>gives bitterness to resentment, it makes vanity insupportable<br>and displays every little spot ofthe soul in it's utmost deformity .<br>Nor does this vice only betray the hidden faults, of a man, and<br>shew them in the most odious colours, but often occasions faults<br>of the most horrid nature, of which the above is a most striking<br>instance.<p>Thus does drunkenness act in direct contradiction to reason,<br>whose business it is to clear the mind of every vice which has<br>crept into it, and to gaurd against all the approaches of any that<br>endeavours to make its entrance.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  But besides these ill effects<br>which this vice produces in the person who is actually under ti's ,<br>dominion, it has also a bad influence on the mind, as it insensi-<br>bly weakens the understanding, impairs the memory, and makes<br>those faults habituel which are produced by frequent excesses.</p>
