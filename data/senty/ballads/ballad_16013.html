	<p> THE LAST&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <p>Confession and&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;dying words of Donald M'Craw, who was exe-<br>cuted at Perth, and his body given to the Doctors for dessec-<br>tion, on Friday the 13th Nov.  1795,  for the horrid murder<br>of his wife Ann Adam, when she was within a month of be-<br>ing delivered of a child.<p>I Donald M'Craw was born in the Shire of Inverness, and am now about 36 years of<br>age. My parents were sober honest industrious people, and as my inclination did not<br>induce me to the laborious toil of husband work, I was learned the trade of weaving.<br>As my native part of the country is not the best of places for that trade, I had not long<br>finished my apprenticeship until I travelled south to improve, myself in my trade. I tra-<br>velled to Glasgow, where I made myself better acquainted with several branches of my<br>calling, and learned to work muslins of several forts, which having done 1 came to this<br>place to settle, and might have lived very comfortable, if it had not been for that curse<br>to all peace and happiness, an overbearing temper in myself, and a fractious discontented<br>temper in my unfortunate wife, blasted all our conjugal happiness, so that instead of bear-<br>ing with one another, as we are commanded in scripture, I Pet. iii. 7,-?II. our time<br>was unhappily spent in mutual railings, upbraidings, threatenings, and even blows. In<br>In this most disagreeable life we lived for several years, but wickedness did not stop here,<br>which may teach those who have the pattern of dreadful example before them, how dan-<br>gerous a thing it is to live a wicked life, and how any vice persevered in grows in us like<br>a second nature, and rare if it be ever left off. I had long made a practice of beating<br>my unhappy wife, custom made me almost think it no crime till it ended in the horrid<br>crime of murder! And that at a time, which made it a double crime, when she had only<br>one month between her and childbed. Oh how unhappy have I been, to embrue my<br>hands in the blood of my helpless wife, and my innocent unborn offspring. I no sooner<br>committed the horrid crime, and saw her lying lifeless, than I was seized with such a<br>trembling horror, that had I been lord of a thousand worlds, I would freely have given<br>them all to have had the horrid deed recalled ; but alas! it was done past recalling. I<br>had no thought nor power to fly from the justice my crime deserved, until a woman who<br>was my neighbour, bade me run for my life. I took her advice, and ran for a few miles<br>until I was out of breath, and then began to reflect that I could not fly from the pre-<br>fence of an all seeing God, nor run from the guilty conscience that now overwhelmed<br>my heart; for should I fly to the uttermost corner of the earth,I would still be in his<br>presence, and ray guilt would accompany me. I therefore thought it would be better<br>to give myself up to justice, and suffer what I justly deserv'd, than live with the pangs<br>of a guilty conscience which are worse than death. With these reflections I surrender-<br>ed myself up; my mind for a little was more easy and calm, but upon reflecting what<br>would become of my poor foul when I must shortly appear before the presence of the<br>Almighty, I was almost distracted, but yet there is hope through the merits of Jesus<br>Christ The Revd. ministers who have attended me, have shewn me from Scripture that<br>my sins are still pardonable; but I am sure nothing less than the atoning blood of Christ<br>that cleanseth from all sin, can purge away the sins of such complicated wickedness as I<br>have been guilty of.<p>I hope all good Christians will join with me, while I am in life, that I may get an in-<br>terest in the Redeemer, and pardon for the greatest and worst of all crimes. I forgive<br>my Judges and Jury as they only did their duty. I forgive all who have done me any<br> injury, and hope all persons will forgive me, I return thanks to the jailors for their hu-<br>mane treatment of me, and die in peace with all men. I have no desire to live any long-<br>er, but wait my appointed time with an humble hope and dependence on God for ac-<br>ceptance through the merits and mediation of Jesus, into whose hand I commit my de-<br>paning Spirit,<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;DONALD M'CRAW<p>Perth 12th Nov, 1795.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <p> 1952&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
