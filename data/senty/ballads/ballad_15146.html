	<p> HARMONIST.<p>I am going to be a Soldier Jenny.<p>In going for a soldier, Jenny,<br>Going o'er the rolling sea,<br>They've  given me a golden guinea,<br>That they say has listed me.<br>'Tis no use to fall a crying,<br>Give your senseless weeping o'er,<br>Many a day you have heard me sighing<br>You should have been kind before.<p>'Tis very fine and pretty, Jenny,<br>Now to wish that I should stay,<br>But, indeed, I'm thinking, Jenny,<br>We'll not meet this many a day.<br>What if heart and spirit sinking ?<br>What if I should come to shame?<br>Be it as it may, I'm thinking,<br>You alone will be to blame.<p>Long and dearly I have loved you,<br>As you must full well have known,<br>If I had not faithless proved you,<br>I had never reckless grown:<br>But, fare you well, the hours are flying<br>Time it is that I was gone, trying,<br>When next another heart you are<br>Jenny, look unto your own.<p>Dandy Servants.<p>Ye braw decent women I'll sing you a song , <br>Of the wit of the auld and the pride of the young,<br>They are all grown sae gaudy, as lure as my life,<br>You'll hardly ken the servant frae the guidwife.<br>Down, down, hey derry down.<p>It's not of farmers' daughters nor tradesmens' indeed,<br>In which I intend to sing my new creed, <br>It's of servant lasses that are getting sae braw,<br>That they outstrip their mistresses far and awa.<p>Their is some exceptions, I must confess,<br>I mean in behaviour, not in their dress,<br>For they dress all alike, and like dandies they go<br>And some of them are decent and some of them no,<p>Between six and seven the Miss goes to school,<br>Before she knows she is wise, or that she's a fool<br>There she learns to count and to write,<br>Till she's fi t for a lawyer  or something such like.<p>When schooling is over, to service she goes,<br>And then for high wages as you may suppose,<br>The first of it goes for a white muslin gown,<br>And a bonnet that would keep moonlight frae the town.<p>And down the bonnet their hangs a bit silk,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>Which my old granny had serving her milk,<br>I own it was useful her beauty to grace,<br>For it hid all the wrinkles that was in her face.<p>She then decks herself like a ship in full sail,<br>The ribbons as broad as the green leaves o' kail;<br>With that and the vail hanging over her e'en,<br>That there's not a wrinkle at all to be seen.<p>She curls up her hair like a water-dogs tail,<br>Roll'd up in paper as round as a snail;<br>The very first Sunday the vail goes on,<br>One says to another, what is she, yon? <p>Then on Sunday she goes to the church,<br>But what she hears there she does not mind much <br>Neither the text nor the psalm she will mind on,<br>But she'll mind very well what her neighbours had on.<p>At balls and meetings she will rant and rove<br>And every new meeting she'll get a new love:<br>But with her gallanting ere three years go round,<br>Her state alters suddently her bonnet goes down.<p>Syne after they're married away the chield goes,<br>And leaves the poor creature in sorrow and woes<br>And away to America then he does trip,<br>And leaves the poor miss thip shaft to lick.<p>Then she's confined like a cow to the grass.<br>And bonnet laid down with the gown, vail, and dress;<br>The cradle she rocks, while the wean it does roar,<br>And she greives at the thing that she laughed at before.<p>White Squall.<p>Katty Darling<p>The sea was brigh and the bark rode well,<br>The breeze bore the tone of the vesper bell,<br>'Twas a gallant bark with a crew as brave<br>As ever launched on a heaving mave,<br>She shone in the light of declining day,<br>And each sail was set, and each heart was gay<p>They neared the land where beauty smiles,<br>The sunny shores of the Greacian isles,<br>All thought of home and that welcome dear<br>That soon should great each wanderer's ear,<br>And in fancy joined the social throng,<br>And the festive dance and the joyous song.<p>A white cloud flies through the azure sky,<br>What means that wild despairing cry,<br>Farewell the visioned scenes of home!<br>That cry is "help !" where no help can come;<br>For the white squall rides on the surging wave<br>And the barks i gulph'd in an ocean grav<p>The flowers are blooming Katty Darling,<br>And the birds are singing on each tree,<br>Never mind your mother's cruel snarling,<br>My love you know I'm waiting for thee!<br>The sun is sweetly smiling,<br>With his face so clear and bright,<br>Haste to your lover, Katty Darling,<br>Ere the morning  will change to  night<br>Katty Darling,<br>The flowers are blooming, &c.<p>Meet mei n the valley, Katty Darling,<br>When the moon is shining o'er the sea,<br>Oh, meet me near the stream, Katty Darling,<br>And tales of love I'll tell unto thee;<br>When the twinkling stars are peeping,<br>Sure those eyes shine far more bright,<br>Oh, meet me in the valley, Katty Darling,<br>And our vows of love we'll pledge to-night<br>Katty Darling, &c.</p>
