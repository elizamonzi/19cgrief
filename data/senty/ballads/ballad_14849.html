	<h2>Transcription</h2>
	<p> The Life and Strange  Adventures of<br>The Female Foot-Boy.<p>Margaret M'Donald, the subject of the following<br>narrative, was born in 1842, of poor, but respectable<br>parents in this town. When she was but 13 years of<br>age, her parents died & left her & an older brother,<br>totally unprovided for Her brother though 5 years<br>older, was but an apprentice tailor, and his scanty<br>wages went but a short way in supporting them; and<br>having no relations to assist them, poor Margaret<br>was obliged to try and earn an honest penny, by<br>running errands, washing out houses, or doing any<br>little service the neighbours might require her to<br>do. She at length obtained a situation with Mrs<br>Walker to take charge of her child, but Margaret<br>being of a gay & thoughtlessdisposition,she neglected<br>the child for play, and was in consequence soon dis-<br>charged. Her brother gave her a good thrashing, &<br>told her he would not encourage her idleness any<br>longer. The next morning she rose early; and<br>when her brother went to his work, she dressed<br>herself in a suit of his Sunday clothes, thinking by<br>assuming male attire, she would be more fortunate<br>in obtaining employment. With a heavy heart and<br>a light purse she took the road. But she had not pro-<br>ceeded far, when she was engaged to assist in taking<br>a drove of sheep to the Market. With the few<br>shillings she received from the drover, she next<br>proceeded to Edinburgh; and, on the day after her<br>arrival in that City, while walking along George's<br>Street, she had the good fortune to pick up a<br>young lady's purse, which she had just dropped.<br>She ran after the lady and returned to her the<br>purse, which contained a considerable sum of money.<br>Miss Gordon of Rock-Vale Terrace was the ladys'<br>name, who was so well pleased at the honest action,<br>that she told the supposed young man to call upon<br>her the next day, which she did. The plain and<br>simple story she told of herself, the prepossessing<br>features, the good address, and the honesty of<br>returning the purse, all tended to gain the favour of<br>Miss Gordon and friends, who at once took her into<br>her service, and under the name of John M'Donald,<br>acted as footman, to the entire satisfaction of the<br>whole family. However, amongst the female<br>portion of the domestics, frequent quarrels occured<br>through jealousy of the footman, It was at length<br>discovered, that M'Donald was paying his addresses<br>to Miss Wilison, the daughter  a respectable Grocer<br>and Provision Merchant, in the neighbourhood<br>where he frequently went for goods to Miss Gordon<br>For upwards of 3 years they kept a correspondence<br>with each other, until it became known to Mr<br>Wilson, that his daughter was keeping company<br>with Miss Gordon's footman. Mr Wilson called his<br>daughter in question, and cautioned her against<br>keeping company with a man she knew nothing<br>about, and forbade her in receiving his addresses in<br>future. But the lovers contrived to have frequent<br>meetings, until Mr Wilson found his orders dis-<br>obeyed ; he again called his daughter to talk<br>about it, when Miss Wilson with tears in her eyes,<br>solemly declared, she would put an end to herself<br>if she did not get the man she had placed her heart<br>on, and that was no other than Miss Gordon's footman<br>In a few days her father called on Miss Gordon, who<br>gave her servant such an excellent character; and<br> as he had saved a considerable sum of money,Miss<br>Gordon promised to give him a handsome present<br>on the day of his marriage, to assist in setting him<br>up in business. He could find little or no objections<br>to their union. Matters being thus arranged, then<br>were duly proclaimed and the happy couple were<br>at length joined in matrimony, for better or worse<br>The wedding party returned, and partook of the<br>good things that were provided by Miss Gordon; <br>for the wedding was solely at that lady's expense.<br>After supper, drink went round, and healths were<br>freely drank, to the welfare of the happy couple;<br>the music struck up, and dancing commenced, in<br>which the bride and groom freely entered.  All<br>went happily on, until by some accident M'Donald<br>slipped, and fell heavily on the floor in a swoon<br>The usual restoratives were applied, with little<br>effect. They next opened his rest, to give him air,<br>when to the great astonishment of all present, the<br>handsome young footman was discovered to be a<br>female. On being restored to consciousness, she<br>related the history of her past life, to the great<br>mirth of the whole wedding party; but as may be<br>expected, it was a great dsappointment to the newly<br>made wife, Miss Wilson, who could scarcely be-<br>lieve what had occured. M'Donald assumed her<br>proper character, and wishes to join in wedlock<br>with a suitable young man, with a £100, One<br>about to go to Australia would be preferred.</p>
