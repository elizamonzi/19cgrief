	<h2>Transcription</h2>
	<p> The Dark Girl<p>Dressed in Blue.<p>When first in Glasgow I arrived, the truth I will unfold,<br>I had a pocketbook with me, well filled with notes and gold,<br>I walked about from place to place its beauties for to view,<br>When all at once I chanced to see a Dark Girl dressed in blue<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She was a nice gal, fal de riddle i do,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A beauty, fal de riddle eh.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She was a fine girl, fal de riddle i do,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A charmer, fal de riddle eh,<p>Her graceful leg and fairy feet, and eyes like diamonds bright,<br>Her coal black hair and rosy cheek they did my heart delight,<br>She stepped into an omnibus, I thought I'd go in too,<br>And there I took my seat beside that dark girl dressed in blue.<p>The 'bus got thronger as we went, she got crushed up rather tight,<br>At length she fainted as I thought, which put me in a fright,<br>Says I, " my dear, a crowded place does not agree with you."<br>" Oh sir, assist me to get out," said the Dark Girl dressed in blue,<p>When we got out of the omnibus, we walked arm in arm together,<br>Then she made free to ask of me, if I'd got a father or mother,<br>"O yes,'' says I, "and a grandmother too, bat pray miss, what areyou'<br>I'm head engineer in a milliner's shop, said the dark girl dressed in blue<p>As we walked on, says I, "you're much fatigued I think,<br>Will you go into this public house, and have a glass of drink,<br>To pay for which she declared she would, saying. " Sir. oblige me do,<br>To change this note, I refuse could not, this dark girl dressed in blue,<p>The change for her I did obtain, she says, " Sir, excuse me pray,<br>Remain yon here for a short time, I shan't be long away,"<br>Scarce had she gone, a policeman came saying. " Please, sir, I want you,<br>That, was a forged note just now changed, where's the dark girl dressed<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;in blue,"<p>Then to the station I was marched, and before the bailies took.<br>And there I told them I had lost my watch and pocket book,<br>They placed a lady at the bar, quite different to my  view.<br>For in deep mourning she was rigged, not a dark girl dressed is blue,<p>They raised her veil, to my surprise, I was taken all aback,<br>Her dress it was a reversible, a sky blue and deep black,<br>The charge it likewise was reversed, they believed my statement true,<br>They acquitted me, but sixty days gave the dark girl dressed in blue.<p>So all young gents I pray beware, and a warning take by me,<br>For young ladies are not always what they do appear to be,<br>Examine well each shawl and dress, the lining likewise too,<br>Or a transformation scene you'll have, like the dark girl dressed in blue.<p>72</p>
