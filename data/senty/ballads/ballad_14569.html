	<p> EXECUTION<p>An account of the Execution of John Thomson and David Dobie, for the Assault,<br>Murder and Robbery of Margaret Paterson, on the 17th April last, with a<br>copy of an affectionate Letter sent to Dobie's wife.<p>David Dobie.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Margaret  Pa'erson.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; John Thomson.<p><p>Edinburgh, Wednesday morning, 9' o'clock, 18th August 1830.<p>THIS morning the above represented unfortunate young men, DAVID<br>DOBIE and JOHN THOMSON, Carters, from Gilmerton, in the vicinity<br>of this City, suffered the last punishment of the law at the head of Libberton<br>Wynd, a little before nine o'clock, for the assault, murder and robbery of Mar-<br>garet Paterson, an unmarried young woman, on the road near Gilmerton, on<br>the evening of the 17th April last.<p>These men were very rude and ill-behaved before and after their trial, it will<br>be recollected ; and were. obliged to be put in separate cells in the Jail, soon<br>after their condemnation, on account of the many reflections on one another's<br>conduct, and on the share that each said the other had in- that late awful and<br>abominable transaction, that brought them to an untimely and shameful end.<br>As the time they were doomed to expiate their crimes on the scaffold approached,<br>they were both brought to a proper sense of their awful situation, and to see<br>the absolute necessity of an immediate and most fervent appeal to.the only<br>quarter from which they could possibly expect mercy ?to the great God of<br>heaven and earth, through the death and sufferings of his only begotten Son,<br>Jesus Christ, This great change must surely be ascribed principally to the in-<br>defatigable exertions of the Clergy, and other devout persons who visited them,<br>under the divine blessing The following Letter from Dobie to his wife last<br>week, will better show the state of their minds at the time :?<p>" My Dear Wife?I write these  lines to you, hoping you may receive some<br>consolation from them.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This is the only comfort that I can now bestow, to let<br>you know the state of my mind ; although my guilt does stare me in the face, I<br> trust God will be merciful to me a humble penitent; although my hands are<br>stained with the blood of that young woman, I trust the  blood of Christ will<br>wash me from my guilt.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dear Wife, I am quite resigned to my fate ; I forgive<br>all my enemies,  and trust they will also  forgive me ; I  die  in  peace with all<br>men.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You will not have the pleasure of laying my body in the dust; I beg of<br>you, as a last wish, that you do not grieve on this account,  as these dry bones<br>will perhaps live to future glory, where men cannot scatter them.<br>" Dear Wife?Show this letter to the aged father of Margaret Paterson, whose<br>hoary head we have brought with sorrow to the grave. We sincerely ask his<br>forgiveness, which is but a poor consolation to him for the loss of his daughter,<br>whom he held so dear, which, by our wicked and subtle hearts, has left him to<br>bewail the loss of a child, and you a faithless husband. Give my last sincere<br>respects to all my friends and comrades, and to the grace of God I leave you<br>and them for ever?Farewell ! Farewell !&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  D. DOBIE.''<p>Edinburgh Jail, 12th August 1830.<p>Accordingly, having been removed from the Jail to the Lock-up-House last<br>evening, where they devoted a few hoars to sleep, they were early waited on by<br>the officiating Magistrates and Clergymen this morning ; and, after spending<br>some little time in religious exercises, and pinioning their arms, soon after<br>eight o'clock they appeared on the Scaffold, cleanly dressed. After a Psalm was<br>sung, and an impressive and fervent prayer put up on their behalf, they mount-<br>ed the fatal drop, where they were seen praying themselves, when the caps<br>were drawing down on shaking hands. In a few moments a signal was dropped<br>by Dobie, and they were instantly launched into the World of Spirits, An im-<br>mense number of spectators attended, After hanging the usual time the bodies<br>were cut down, and laid in shells to be afterwards conveyed to the College for<br>dissection.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(Price One Penny.)<p>Robertson and Thomson, Printers, Edinburgh.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
