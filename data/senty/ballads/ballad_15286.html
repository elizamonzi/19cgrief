	<p> A Particular Account of the Trial and Sen,<br>tence of the Rev, Joseph Robertson, and<br>W. Pearson, accused of Falshood, Fraud &<br>Forgery, and of celebrating unlawful mar-<br>riages, on Wednesday March 18, 1818.<p>ON Wednesday came on the trial<br>  of the Rev. Joseph Robertson,<br>minister of the gospel in Edinburgh<br>and William Pearson, spirit-dealer<br>in Canongate, accused of falsehood,<br>fraud, and forgery, and of celebrat-<br>ing unlawful marriages.<p>The pannels, as we stated on a<br>former day, had pleaded not guilty,<br>and having again adhered to that<br>plea, a Jnry was chosen, and the<br>trial proceeded. Alexander Ross<br>sesson clerk of North Leith ; knows<br>Mr. Robertson, he never but once<br>applied to the witness for a certifi-<br>cate of proclomation of bam and<br>that was about three years ago.<br>And being shown a certificate in<br>name of Mooney a soldier in the<br>88th regiment, and a Girl named<br>Mr. Pherson, he  declares it to be a<br>forgery and the name Alexander<br>Ross, at the bottom of it not to be<br>the witness's hand writing : and a<br>certificate in favour of a soldier of<br>the 88th, named Fitzgerald, and a<p> girl named Urquhart, shown to him;<p>he also declares to be a forgery.<p>Alexander Ross, jun. son of the<br>preceding witness, also declared,<br>that the two certificates  are not the<br>writing of his father.<p>Sarah Urquhart, late servant to<br>Mr. Grant of Rothiemurchus Wit,<br>ness was married in October last<br>to Edward Fitzgerald, a private in<br>the 88th Regiment, by the Rev,<br>Mr. Robertson, She and her hus-<br>band, with Mooney and Margere:<br>M 'Pherson, called upon Mr R. on<br>on a Sunday, about 11 o'clock, and<br>told him they wanted to be married,<br>he said he would do nothing then<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;as he was going to church, but told<br>them to come back at one o'clock.<br>They returned at that hour, and<br>Mr R. shewed them into a little<br>room, and said he would send his<br>maid servant along with the men to<br>a place where they would get<br>lines. The men went away for the<br>lines, and came lack, saving they<br>had been refused them. Mr R.<br>then desired them to go to one Pear-<br>son's and perhaps he might get lines<br>tor them. They accordingly went<br>down to Pearson's; and the men<br>went into the house, and Pearson<br>went with them to endeavour to get<br>marriage lines. They went along<br>the South Bridge, but the men<br>came back, saying they had been<br>refused lines there already. They<br>went down to Pearson's, and shortly<br>after Mr R. came and said he did<br>not know What to do with them.<br>Pearson said to him he dared to say he might<br>marry them, for be might recollect that they<br>had got a thing of that kind done before,<br>and had got the lines after, and had sent<br>them after the parties. Mr R. said he<br>thought he recollected that they had done<br>that ; and Pearson and Mr R. then walk-<br>ed into another room, leaving the witness and<br>the other three by themselves. Pearson<p>came back, and asked 7s 6d. from each cou-<br>ple to get the marriage lines. The men<br>had not so much money, but Pearson said,<br>the parson could  not think of doing it unite<br>they got the money ; and said that if they<br>would be quick  and  get it, he would remain<br>as he was not in a hurry. Witness and the o-<p>ther girl went for the money , and were not<p>many minutes absent; when they came back<p>Mr R.was sitting with  the two men, and<p>writing the little lines  he gave them. Fits-<p>gerald gave 7s 6d for each of the lines, and<br>5s 10 Mr R. who put  it in his pocket, giv-<br>ing the 15s to  Pearson to get the lines, Pear-<br>son said that if they would call at either his<br>house or Mr Robertson's, any day after<br>Monday, the lines would be ready for them.<br>They were then married, and Mr. R. gave<br>witness a line, certifying that she and Fits-<br>gerald were married before witnesses. On<br>Tuesday or Wednesday after the marriage,<br>the other girl, M 'Pherson, went for the lines<br>but Mr R. said they could not get them un-<br>less the whole four were present, and the men<br>were at Perth. M ' Pherson wrote to the<br>men, who answered and told her to go to<br>Mr R. and demand the lines or the money.<br>Witness and M 'Pherson then went to Mr R.<br>and showed him the letter and he told them<br>to go to Pearson, which they did, and<br>said he was afraid they could not get them<br>but desired them to call upon him to-mor-<br>row, when he would try and get them ; they<br>called again at Pearson's next day, and he<br>said he had got them, and desired them to<br>go to Mr R.'s. and he would follow. They<br>went  to Mr R.'s and he said he was very<br>happy they had got; the lines, and Pearson<br>immediately came in. Mr R. then took the<br>lines, and wrote something on them.<br>Pearson said that they were indebted to him.<br>for the trouble he had had, but Mr R. said <br>he had better give them something than take <p>any thing from them.<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  Edward Fitzgerald, Private in the 88th<p>regiment, gave similar evidence as to the<p>marriage betwixt him and the preceding<p>witness.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When he went first to Mr R. he<br>asked him if he had a line from his officer,<p>and he said no; he desired him to come <p>back at one o'clock, when he sent his ser-<br>vant maid along with witness and  Moony<br>to one Paisley, the Session clerk, who re-<br>fused to give the lines, because witness had<p>no line from his commanding officer. Upon<p>returning to Mr R. he said he did not<br>know what to do with them, as it was most-<br>ly beyond his power to marry them. He<br>then gave witness a line to Pearson, and<br>said he might be apt to get the lines for<br>them. Pearson said he would do every<br>thing in his power to get Mr R. to marry<br>them, and desired the whole four to come<br>down to his house at four o'clock, and Mr<br>R. would be there. After four o'clock the<br>whole went to Pearson's, and he and Mr<p>R. went into a room, and had some conver<p>sation. Pearson then came  and asked if<br>they were ready, witness answered they were,<br>and Mr R. then came into the room. Mr<br>R. then  desired them them to leave 7s 6d.<br>a piece for the  lines, and 2s 6d a  piece for<br>the marriage, The two women then went<br>away for the money, and parties were<p>married.<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Margaret Macpherson corroborated, in <p>every particular, the testimony of Sarah<p>Urquhart ,  and  John  Monney ,  private in<p>the 88th , gave similar  evidence  to that of<p>Fitzgarald.<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After some remarks from the Lords Suc-<br>coth and Reston. Lord Gillies addressed<br>the prisoners  on  the  nature of  their  crime.<br>He then sentenced both prisoners to three<p>months confinement in the Jail of Canongate<p>and Mr Robertson thereafter to be banish-<br>ed Scotland for life, in terms of the statuto<br>and Pearson for the period of fourteen years<br>with the usual certifications.<p>Edinburgh: Printed for R.
