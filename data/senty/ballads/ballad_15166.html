	<p> The Life of JAMES -REVEL,<p>THE UNHAPPY&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;TRANSPORT.<p>Giving a Sorrowful account of his fourteen years' transportation to Botany Bay, <br>New South Wdles, in February, 1808, and his return home to London, in March<br>1 st, 1823, with a serious word of advice to all young men and women.<p>MY loving countrymen pray lend an ear<br>Unto these relationa I bring you to hear,<br>My sufferings at large I will unfold;<br>Though strange, it is as true as ever was told.<br>Of honest parents I did come but poor,<br>Who besides me had children never more;<br>Near Temple Bar was born their darling son,<br>And in virtue's path for sometime I did run.<br>My parents in me took great delight,<br>And sent me to school to read and write,<br>And cast accounts likewise, as it appears,<br>Until that I was aged thirteen years.<br>Unto a tin-man I was an apprentice bound,<br>My master and my mistress good I found,<br>Who liked me well, my business I did mind.<br>From me my parents comfort then did find.<br>Near to Moor-fields my master he did dwell,<br>Where into wicked company there I fell;<br>To wickedness I quickly was inclined,<br>So soon it tainted on my youthful minds<br>With them a thieving I did go,<br>But little did my tender parents know<br>I followed courses which were most wild ;<br>My absence grieved them being their darling child.<br>Strong liquors banished the thoughts of fear,<br>But justice stopt us in our wild career.<br>One night was taken up one of our gang,<br>Who five impeached, and three of them were hung<br>I was one of the five that was tried and cast.<br>Yet transportation I did get at last<br>A just reward for all my actions base,<br>But justice overtook meat the last,<br>Invain I grieved, in vain my&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;parents weep.<br>For I was quickly sent on board of ship :<br>With melting kisses, and with heavy heart,<br>From my tender parents I then did part.<br>In a few days we left the river quite,<br>And in a short time of land we lost the sight<br>The captain and the sailors used us well,<br>But kept us under lest we should rebel.<br>Five of our number on the passage died,<br>Who buried were on the ocean wide.<br>After sailing seven months or more,<br>We at Port Jackson were all put on shore :<br>Then to refresh us we were all made clean,<br>That to our buyers we might better seem,<br>The things were given that to each did belong,<br>And they that had clean linen put it on;<br>The women separated from us stood,<br>As well as we to be of them void.<br>In a short time some men up to us came,<br>And ask'd our trades, and others ask'd our names<br>Some eyed our limbs, and turn'd us round,<br>Examined us like horses, to see if we were sound.<br>" What trade my lad ?"?-said one of them to me,<br>"A  tin-man, sir "&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ' that will not do for me"<br>At length a grim old gentleman up to me came,<br>He asked my trade, likewise my name,<br>I told him a tin-man was my trade,<br>Not eighteen years of age, I also said ;<br>To him I told the cause which brought me there,<br>That transported I was for fourteen-years;<br>And when he from me that did understand,<br>He bought me from the captrin out of hand.<br>Down to the harbour I was taken again,<br>On board of a ship bound in an iron chain,<br>Which I was forced to wear night and day,<br>And fear I from the sloop should run away;<br>And when the ship was loaded we were sent<br>A hundred miles up the river went.<br>The weather cold, and hard was my fare,<br>My lodgings on the deck both hard and bare.<br>At last to my new master's house I came,<br>In a large town New Caledonia by name ;<br>When my European clothes were taken from me,<br>Which I never after then could see,<br>A canvas shirt and trowsers they me gave,<br>A hop sack frock unto which I was a slave;<br>No shoes or stockings had I for to wear,<br>Nor hat nor cap, my head and feet went bare.<br>Distrest, I next to the field did go,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  <br>Amongst tobacco plants to work with a hoe.<p> At day-light in the morning our work begun.<br>And lasted till the setting of the sun;<br>And when our hard days work was done;<br>Away to the mill we must be gone<br>Until twelve or one o'clock at night a grinding corn,<br>And we must be up by day break in the morn,<br>And if we offer once to run away,<br>For every hour we must serve a day;<br>For every day a week....they are so severe?<br>For every week a month and for every month a year<br>At last it pleased God I sick did fall,<br>Yet no favour I received at all,<br>For I was forced to work while I could stand,<br>Or hold the hoe within my hand.<br>Down on my kpees the Lord I did implore,<br>To let me see my native land once more,<br>And thro' his gracious mercy my life I would amend<br>And be a comfort to my nearest friends.<br>The Lord had seen the grief that sprung my heart,<br>And his gracious mercy to me he did impart,<br>My health I got again 'twas all I then did want,<br>It pleased the Lord he to me such grace did grant,<br>That though in barbarous place, and in exile<br>I served him in fear, and many blessings I did feel<br>Now twelve years being past, and only two to stay<br>When death did my cruel master then call away.<br>But that was no relief to me at all,<br>For the widow would not her plantation sell,<br>At last a planter who, at Sidney town did dwell,<br>Came down to view it, and he liked it well;<br>He bought the negros who for life were slaves.<br>But no transported felons would he have,<br>So we were put like sheep, into a fold,<br>Unto the highest bidder to be sold,<br>A gentleman who seemed very grave,<br>Said unto me, " how long are you to slave?<br>" Not quite two years" I to him then replied.<br>" That is but very short, indeed !" he cried.<br>He said no more, but from me short did turn,<br>W hilst from my eyes the tears did trinkling run ;<br>I saw him to my overseer go,<br>But what he said to him I do not know.<br>Then straight to me he came again and said,<br>" No longer here remain, but go with me.<br>For I have bought you here this very day,<br>He said he would not use me as a slave,<br>But as a servant if I'd well behave,<br>And if I pleased him when my time expired.<br>He'd send me home again if I required.<br>My new master in a smooky town did dwell.<br>By trade a Cooper and he lived well<br>And if at any time he did ride out,<br>I with him rode the country round about,<br>At length my fourteen years expired quite,<br>Which filled my very soul with great delight,<br>To think no longer there I should remain,<br>But to Old England once return again.<br>My master unto me expressed much love.<br>And according to his promise he did prove ;<br>He got me a ship and I came home again.<br>With joy and comfort tho' I went with pain,<br>My father and my mother well I found,<br>To see me with joy they did abound ;<br>My mother over me did weep for joy,<br>My father cried once more I see my darling boy,<br>I told them all the dangers I came through,<br>Likewise my sickness and perils too.<br>Which filled their tender hearts with sad surprise,<br>Whilst melting tears ran trickling down their eyes.<br>My countrymen  take warning before it is too late,<br>Lest you may share my hard unhappy fate;<br>Though little crimes which you may have done,<br>Think of seven or fourteen years to come,<br>Forced from your home to go amongst negroes,<br>To work as a slave in different countries ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>Young men and women take pains your lives all to amend<br>Take my advice as one that is your friend ;<br>Though but little about it any of you may care,<br>Hard is your lot if cnce you go there.<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
