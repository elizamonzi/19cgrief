	<h2>Transcription</h2>
	<p> correct and Particular Account of the Execution<br>of CHARLES M'EWEN, commonly called " The<br>Cock of the North," who was Hanged on Wednes-<br>day the 7th April 1824, at the head of Libberton<br>Wynd, Edinburgh, for the Barbarous Murder of<br>Margaret Mooney, in October last, on a Moor in<br>Aberdeenshire ; and his Body given for Dis-<br>section, with his Behaviour at the Place of Execu-<br>tion.<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Edinburgh, 7th April, 1821.<p>THIS day, the unfortunate CHARLES M'EWEN, alias M'EOCH,<br>and commonly known in the north of Scotland by " the<br>Cock of the North" ended his mortal career on a Scaffold, at the<br>head of Libberton Wynd here, pursuant to his sentence.<p>This unfortunate man was a native of Ireland, and assumed va-<br>rious names, as circumstances suited him, but was best known by<br>M'Ewen. He left Ireland about ten years ago, and travelled prin-<br>cipally in the Counties of Forfar, Aberdeen, and Inverness, as a<br>Tinker, and vender of Hardware, &c. He had various women<br>with whom he cohabited as man and wife, and several children.<br>The unhappy woman Margaret Mooney, had been with him only<br>a few days at the time of the murder. Thay were travelling to-<br>gether, on the 9ih of October last, through the Firmouth, an un.<br>inhibited moon or mountain near the junction of the shires of<br>Aberdeen and Forfar; and, as was proved on his trial, he delibe-<br>rately murdered her in the most barbarous manner., by striking her<br>on the head with a small Iron anvil, without any provocation what-<br>ever, in consequence of which she died on the spot, .and for which<br>he was soon after apprehended.<p>Having emitted two several declarations before the Sheriff-Sub<br>Stitute of Aberdeenshire, in which he denied any knowledge of the<br>circumstance, except seeing the body lying; all bloody as he passed,<br>he forced on his trial, by running his letters.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Accordingly, he was<br>brought from Aberdeen Jail to Edinburgh, and tried  before the-<br>High Court of Justiciary, on the 1st of March last; and, after the<br>fullest investigation, was unanimously fonnd Guilty by a respect-<br>able Jury.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After a most impressive address from the Lord Justice<br>Clerk, in which he recommended to him to employ the few remain-<br>ing days allowed him on earth in the important works of repent-<br>ance, and to endeavour, by the deepest contrition and heartfelt sor-<br>row for his past offences to make his peace with that God against<br>whom he had so heinously sinned, by the perpetration of a crime,<br>of all others the most foul and detestable, he was sentenced to be<br>hanged by the. hands of the common executioner, on Wednesday<br>he 7th of April next, at the head of Libberton Wynd, betwixt the<br>hours of eight and ten in this morning ; and his Body  thereafter to<br>be given to Dr Alexander Munro, to be dissected and anatomized.<br>To which he immediately replied, " Thank your Lordship, but I'll<br>die innocent"<p>During the whole trial, as well as the delivery of this address<br>and pronouncing the awful sentence, M'Ewen appeared quite firm<br>and hardened, nor had he, for a considerable time after his condem-<br>nation, evinced a becoming sense of his melancholy situation. Nei-<br>ther the certainty of the awful fate which was shortly to overtake<br>him, nor the reflections to which his crime and his punishment<br>were likely, in solitude, to give rise, had produce any salutary im-<br>pression on his mind , but, on the contrary, seemed to repel any<br>advances of kindness from these about him. To the inquiries of<br>one gentleman he abrubtly replied," I am not the better of you,<br>nor any like you." To another gentleman, in an official situation, he<br>betrayed similar impatience, and haughtily expressed a wish that he<br>night not receive any more visits of such a nature. As to.the af-<br>fair that brought him there, he added, it was a matter that concern-<br>ed  himself  alone. He was very restless, and continnually moving<br>to the full extent of the chain allowed him in this respect differ-<br>ing from almost every one who was placed in the like unhappy cir-<br>cumstances, while others  sought repose, or were sunk into despon<br>dency, he was ever in motion. Latterly, however, he entertained<br>feelings better Suited to his situation. He was a Catholic and was<br>regularly attended by three clergy men of that persuasion, to whose ex-<br>hortations, in a great measure, must have been Ascribed the change in<br>his behaviour. He was a tall stout, man, about thirty-six years of<p> Edinburgh, Printed, for Alexr. Turnbull, Price One Penny.</p>
