	<p> SCOTCH WORDS<p><br>Copies can always be had at 80 London Street.<p>They speak in riddles north beyond the Tweed,<br>The plain, pure English they can deftly read ;<br>Yet when without the book they come to speak,<br>Their lingo is half English and half Greek.<p>Their jaws are CHAFTS ; their hands when closed are NEIVES ;<br>Their bread's not cut in slices, but in SHEIVES ;<br>Their armpits are their OXTERS ; palms are LUIFS ;<br>Their lads are CALLANTS, and their women KIMMERS ;<br>Good lasses DENTY  Queans, and bad ones LIMMERS ;<br>They THOLE when they endure, SCART when they scratch ;<br>And when they give a sample, it's a SWATCH.<br>Scolding is FLYTIN', and a long palaver<br>Is nothing but a BLETHER or a HAVER.<br>This room they call the BUT and that the BEN,<br>And what they do not know they DINNA KEN.<br>On keen cold days they say the wind BLAWS SNELL,<br>And when they wipe their nose they DICHT their BYKE.<br>And they have words that Johnson could not spell,<br>As im-phm, which means : anything you like, <br>While some, though purely English, and well known,<br>Have yet a Scottish meaning of their own :?<br>To PRIG'S to plead, beat down a thing in cost;<br>To COFF'S to purchase, and a cough's a HOST;<br>To CRACK is to converse ; the LIFT'S the sky ;<br>And BAIRNS are said to GREET when children cry.<br>When lost, folks never ask the way they want?<br>They SPEIR the GATE ; and when they yawn they GAUNT.<br>Beetle with them's a CLOCK ; a flame's a LOWE ;<br>Their straw is STRAE ; chaff, CAUFF ; and hollow, HOWE.<br>A PICKLE means a few ; MUCKLE is big;<br>And a piece of crockery ware is called a PIG.<p>Speaking of pigs?when Lady Delacour<br>Was on her celebrated Scottish tour,<br>One night she made her quarters at the " Crown"<br>The head inn of a well-known country town.<br>The chambermaid, on lighting her to bed,<br>Before withdrawing, curtsied low, and said,?<p>" This nicht is cauld, my leddie, wad ye please<br>To take a pig i' the bed to warm your taes?"<p>" A pig in bed to tease!" What's that you say?<br>You are impertinent?away, away !"<p>"Me impudent ! no, mem- I mean nae harm,<br>But Just the greybeard pig to keep ye warm,"<p>" Insolent hussy, to confront me so !<br>This very instant shall your mistress know,<br>The bell?There's none of course?go, send her here."<p>" My mistress, mem, I dinna need to fear :<br>In sooth, it was hersel' that hade me speir.<br>Nae insult mem ; we thocht ye wad be gled,<br>On this cauld nicht, to hae a pig i' the bed."<p>" Stay, girl; your words are strangely out of place,<br>And yet I see no insult in your face.<p>Is it a custom in your country, then,<br>For ladies to have pigs in bed with them !"<p>" Oh, quite a custom wi' the gentles, mem;<br>Wi' gentle ladies, ay, and gentle men;<br>And, truth ! if single, they would sairly miss<br>Their het pig on a cauldriff nicht like this."<p>" I've seen strange countries, but this surely beats<br>Their rudest makeshift for a warming pan.<br>Suppose, my girl, I should adopt your plan,<br>You would not put the pig between the sheets!"<br>" Surely, my leddy, and nae itherwhere;<br>Please, mem, ye'll find it dae the maist guid there."<p>"Fie, Fie ! 'twould dirty them, and if I kept<br>In fear of that, you know I should not sleep."<br>" Ye'll sleep far better, mem.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Take my advice ;<br>The nicht blaws snell?the sheets are cauld as ice;<br>I'll fetch you up a fine warm cosy pig ;<br>I'll mak' ye sae comfortable and trig,<br>Wi' coortains, blankets, every kind o' hap,<br>And warrant you to sleep as sound's a tap.<br>As for the fylin' o' the sheets?dear me,<br>The pig's as clean outside as pig can be.<br>A weel-closed mooth's enough for ither folk,<br>But if you like, I'll put it in a poke."<p>" But, Effie,?that's your name, I think you said-<br>Do you, yourself, now take a pig to bed!"<p>" Eh ! na, mem, pigs are only for the great,<br>Wha lie on feather beds, and sit up late.<br>Feathers and pigs are no for puir riff-raff:<br>Me and my neighbour lassie lie on cauff."<p>"What's that?a calf! If I your sense can gather,<br>Yon and the other lassie sleep together,<br>Two in a bed, and with the calf between;<br>That, I suppose, my girl, is what you mean !"<br>" Na, na, my leddy,?'od, ye're jokin' noo?<br>We sleep thegither, that is very true,<br>But nocht between us ; wi' our claes a' aff,<br>Except our sarks, we lie upon the cauff."<p>" Well, well, my girl ! I am surprised to hear<br>That we of English habits live so near<br>Such barbarous customs.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Effie, you may go;<br>As for the pig, I thank you, but?no, no?<br>Ha, ha ! good-night, excuse me if I laugh?<br>I'd rather be without both pig and calf."<p>On the return of Lady Delacour,<br>She wrote a book about her northern tour,<br>Wherein the facts are graphically told,<br>That Scottish gentlefolks, when nights arc cold,<br>Take into bed fat pigs to keep them warm ;<br>While common folks, who share their beds in halves-<br>Denied the richer comforts of the farm-<br>Can only warm their sheets with lean cheap calves.</p>
