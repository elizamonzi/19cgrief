	<p> The Last SPEECH, Confession, and dying declaration of WILLIAM SCOTT, who was Executed<br>at the Cross of Glasgow, on Wednesday, the 3d of December, 1788, for the crime of House-break-<br>ing and Theft.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<p>I WILLIAM SCOTT, aged twenty years, born at Ha-<br>milton in the county of Lanark, of honest industrious<br>but poor parents, whose circumstences prevented them of<br>bestowing on&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;me education as&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;they would&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;inclined and<br>which was necessary for me.--I was at an early period<br>of my life put by my parents to the weaver trade, but alas!<br>an unsettled disposition which soon discovered it self in me,<br>together with my falling in with idle & desolate company,<br>who in a very early period of my life made a tool of me for<br>their base purposes, soon carried me off from following my<br>trade and from the parts of virtue, which I sadly repent<br>this day. Was I to enumerate the many scenes I have been<br>connected with, and accessary to, they would far execed<br>the bounds that is here intended, But as it is expected that<br>persons in my situation will before their departure from<br>earth say something of their past life and transactions. I<br>feel a pressing inclination to do so, tho' I declare no per-<br>son earthly has induced or pressed me to make a Speech,<br>and as I, in great sincerity of heart before God, deeply re-<br>gret my conduct in the by past part of my life, so I, in<br>making this declaration, do it with truth and candure, as<br>in the presence of that great God, who is truth itself, &<br>in whose presence I am soon to appear. It is unnecessary<br>for me to gall the ears of the godly and honest reader, or<br>to please the fancy of the vain scoffer, with a repetition of<br>all the crimes I have been guilty of, suffice it for me to say<br>something anent those I am condemned to die an ignomi-<br>nious death for, and some nearly connected with them.<br>The first part of my indictment charges me with breaking<br>into a house at Barrowfield, possessed by William Smart,<br>keeper of the Tontine in Glasgow, and stealing therefrom<br>a quantity of wearing apparel, the property of the said<br>William Smart, his wife, and some of their servants; now<br>the truth is this, I and Thomas Wothespoon, stocking-<br>maker late in Ardrie, thereafter in Gorbals of Glasgow, &<br>present prisoner in the tolbooth of Glasgow, did really<br>break into that house and we did steal the said articles, &<br>carry them to the said Thomas Wotherspoon's house in<br>Gorbals. Sometime thereafter, I was taken by the said<br>Thomas Wotherspoon from his house in Gorbals, to house<br>or warehouse of William Taylor, thread manufacturer in<br>Glasgow, where Wotherspoon said there was a good op-<br>portunity of getting some good yarn, and upon our arriv-<br>ing at the place, Thomas Wotherspoon entered the house<br>by a window and I stood on the outside, and he threw out<br>at the window a quantity of yarn, which he and I carried<br>to his house in Gorbals.-Bethia Kent, wife of the said<br>Thomas Wotherspoon was in practice of travelling about<br>the country and some of her children with her on the pre-<br>tence of begging, but the real fact is, was to bring notice<br>to her husband of any thing she saw to steal, and when she<br>came home she gave him notice of what she saw ; in prese-<br>cution of this way of life she had been at the house of Little<br>Govan, belonging to Mr Rae, where she had seen in a<br>house upon the left hand at entering in, within the gate<br>a quantity of Cheese and Butter, of this she informed her<br>husband, and upon the Saturday night mentioned in the<br>Indictment against me and my brother John Scott, the said<br>Thomas Wotherspoon and  I, and no person but ourselves,<br>set out from his house in Gorbals and went to Little Govan,<br>house, where we pressed up two or three spars of the rail<br>or pailing upon the top of the stone dyke before the house,<br>by which means we got into the court, and thereafter<br>broke or loosed out the window of the house where the<br>cheeses and butter were, and stole and carried off there-<br>from the whole cheeses and butter mentioned in the Indict-<br>ment, and hid them in a field of barley near Little Govan,<br>and some nights there after, the said Wotherspoon and I<br>carried them by degrees to his house in Gorbals, where<br>part of them, as well as part of the other articles above-<br>mentioned were found. Wotherspoon and I put the boat<br>in which part of the butter was, after taking the butter<br>out of it, into a concealed part of the fields, and we broke<br>the - in which another part of it was, and carried the<br>butter to Wotherspoon's house in pocks, and the crock in<br>which the butter appeared at my trial, was brought by<br>Wotherspoon's wife for the purpose of holding the latter,<br>the stone baton in which another part of it was, belonged<br>to her also, On another occasion, but before this fatal<br>one, Wotherspoon's wife happened to be the way of Carth-<br>cart, where she discovered some cheeses in a milk house in<br>that neighbourhood, and also that the family had been<br>warning some clothes, upon this information Wotherspoon<br>intioed me to go with him, I being drunk, be having high-<br>land clothes, a bonnet and tartan plaid, we set out in the<br>evening, and according to her direction went to Cathcast,<br>the house which we designed for was at the other side of<br>the water, however, before our going the length of it, we<br>broke first into Mr Dow's milk house, and then into his<br>dwelling house, where we were about carrying off a chest<br>but the servant maid having heard us and called on her<br>master, we were obliged to run off, Wotherspoon blamed<br>me for not turning back and knocking down the girl : we<br>then proceeded in search of the house we were designed &<br>searched the milk-house, we did not find the cheeses as we<br>expected, but took the cock out of the milk barrel and<br>spilled the milk, but we broke into the house and carried<br>therefrom a quantity of clothes, which except a very few<br>articles we hid in a part near at hand, and went back<br>thereafter and took away some of the said articles, threw<br>the rest over the dyke and left them.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>On another occasion Wotherspoon and I cut cut a wea-<br>ver's webb out of his loom in Gorbals, but by my persuasi-<br>on he put it back again , and I refuse that I gave the black<br>cleathes now in the Chamber of Glasgow to the said Tho-<br>mas Wotherspoon, or knew any thing of them. Many<br>other things we were guilty of, but is useless to go into<br>particulars.-It will now be asked what connections I had<br>with Wotherspoon, and how I came to carry on this trade<br>with him: I was a deserter from the 26 Reg. of foot tho'<br>after wards sworn in as a deserter from the 9th, & having<br>come to this part I staid a few days at my brother John<br>Scott's in the neighbourhood of Gorbals, and my brother's<br>wife seeing me idle, and fearing danger if I remained about<br>their house, would not allow me to stay there, & having<br>been formerly acquainted with Wotherspoon when  he was<br>confined in the cels at Glasgow, where I also was, I took<br>up with him in his exploits, and I can safely say, that I<br>received but a small part of the booty for even in this in-<br>stance, Wotherspoon and his wife were not honest to me,<br>for they only gave me a few shillings now and then, which<br>I generally drank with them; indeed then gave me plen-<br>ty of drink, to which, alas! I was too much adicted, for<br>I answered their purpose best when I was half drunk.<br>Let none say, or so much as harbour in their mind a<br>suspicion that I am blaming the said Thomas Wotherspoon<br>or his wife for any thing they are not guilty of on account<br>of sheir being witnesses against me and my said brother<br>John Scott at our trial, no I appeal to God Almighty &<br>to their own consciences, when they read these lines, if I<br>have not told truth as a dying man and as I desire to die<br>in peace with all mankind without any grudge, and I<br>earnestly entreat to be forgiven of God and of every per-<br>son I have offended -The said Thomas Wotherspoon and<br>Bethia Kent his wife, accused the said John Scott my bro-<br>ther, as being guilty with me of the crimes for which I<br>am now to die and poor man, he is condemned also in<br>consequence of their evidence, tho' at present our most<br>Gracious Sovereign has been pleased to grant him a respite<br>during his pleasure. It is not time for me now to disemble<br>or tell falsehood, and although it may be thought natural<br>for me to do good to my brother if it were in my power,<br>yet every unprejudiced heart and mind believe me to be<br>serious, and that I talk as in the presence of and as I shall<br>answer to a great God, I do here by declare that my said<br>brother John Scott, was not guilty with me, nor accessary<br>to, nor knew of any of the crimes laid to his charge, as<br>along with me mentioned in the indictment, and for which<br>he is condemned, altho' from the nature and effect of  the evidence<br>against him and me it was impossible for the Jury not to bring him<br>in guilty along with me, but I would advise Wotherspoon and his<br>wife seriously to consider the share they have had in this matter before<br>it be too late. I did in peace with all men, I freely forgive judge<br>and Jury, who both paid great attention to my trial, and gave a \ill\<br>verdict and sentence against me. I return my thanks to the Counsel<br>and other gentlemen employed in my defence, as they all did the<br>utmost of their power. I return my thanks to the Ministers and<br>other Christian people in this city who have attended me since I was<br>lost. I return my thanks to the Keeper and under Keepers of the<br>Tolbooth of Glasgow, particularly Mrs. Brownlie for their kindness<br>every person young and old to seek and fear God, and I warn them<br>against idleness, drinking, and keeping bad company; and I entreat<br>all to keep the Sabbath day holy to the Lord, as they regard their<br>own souls  salvation  O blessed Redeemer. who came into the world<br>to seek and to save them that are lost; I hope through thy merits the<br>forgiveness of my manifold sins; Into thy hands I commit my Spirit.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; WILLIAM SCOTT.<p>The above Speech was signed and delivered in our presence,<br>JAMES BROWNLIE, Keeper of the JAIL.<br>WILLIAM YOUNG, Under Jailor.</p>
