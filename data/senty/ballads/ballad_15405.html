	<p> A VOICE FROM THE DUNGEON.<p>The die is now cast, the sword of Justice has been bared, and is<br>about to descend on his devoted head. His days are numbered, the<br>sixth day of March being the one fixed for execution.<p>On that day his life will be offered up to atone for the laws he has<br>broken, committed no doubt while in a state of intoxication, we may<br>here briefly advert to the leading circumstances of the murder. Mr<br>E. T. Salt was by trade a Tailor, but by some means he obtained a<br>situation in the Excise someyears ago. He is a stout, mild, good<br>looking man, and has not one particle of ferocity in his demeanor,<br>he wears a moustache and beard, and is the most unlikely man, as far<br>as appearances go, capable of committing such a crime. He is a native<br>of Staffordshire in England. He and his wife lived on the very worse<br>of terms. Her habits of intemperance constantly spoiling the har-<br>mony of the family. He more than once was heard to say that he<br>would kill her, especially on one occasion when the woman Janet<br>Wallace, a publican said, " If you kill her then you'll be hanged,''<br>how fearfully her prediction has been verified.<p>It is of no use now to refer to the murder, it was perpetrated in<br>such a manner that human nature recoils from the horrors and beastly<br>depravity of the crime for which he has forfeited his life.<p>He is now confined in a cell in the the new prison. Two men<br>have been appointed to sit up with him, one during the day the other<br>at night. The prisoner speaks often and with much annimation con-<br>cerning his deceased partner.<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the cold silent cell, dejected he lay<br>O'erwhelmed with terror afraid for to pray,<br>For his crimes he did weep, and his sufferings severe,<br>While his face was suffused with the penitent's tear.<p>Soon sweet gentle sleep o'er his vision did steal<br>When his woes and his sufferings he ceased to feel<br>He dreamed of his home and relations so dear,<br>Who now tranquil do sleep, and strangers to fear.<p>And he dreamed of his home, and of his dear wife<br>Ere the demon intemperance had embittered his  life ;<br>When affection and love in their bosoms did dwell,<br>Alas now exchanged for the doomed felous cell.<p>O Salt we mourn thy misfortune,<br>Although that we cannot approve of thy crime<br>But thousands will weep on that fatal morning<br>To see thee cut off in the height of thy prime.<p>So kind hearted people pray don't be exulting,<br>O'er the fate of this culprit whose time draweth near<br>When we think of his crimes think too of his sufferings<br>And for him in pity drop one gentle tear.<p>A popular author when writing on capital punishment, describes<br>the last night of the condemned felon in his solitary cell: He alter-<br>nately lay down in his bed or sat on a small box ; he attempted to<br>enter into conversation with the gruff, stern, unfeeling warden of the<br>prison. At this time he hears a bell striking an hour from one of<br>the public clocks. He counts,-'tis eleven, he muttered to himself.<br>You are mistaken, sir, replied the guard; 'tis twelve. I am tired,<br>observed the condemned man. So am I, said the keeper; I hate<br>to be sent to a job like this, it is so melancholy ; and he began in<br>a low voice to hum a song about Dick Turpin. The object of their<br>solicitude undressed and got into bed. My life has been forfeited,<br>I am doomed unfit to live - I am now well guarded-I am attended<br>by the ministers of religion-they are desirous of making me a good<br>man, and after their task has been completed, I am to be led out<br>and put to death. From man I have no mercy to expect; 'tis from<br>God alone that it can be obtained. Filled with such reflections he<br>lay down and slept soundly. Poor man, another night and your<br>sleep will be sound indeed.<p>We understand that the wretched man is conducting himself with<br>the greatest properity under his impending fate. By his own request,<br>he has been visited by the Rev. Mr Drummond of St. Thomas' Chapel,<br>and listens with great attention to his instructions. He was visited<br>yesterday forenoon by his four children. He exhorted his eldest<br>child, a fine boy of ten years of age, totally to eschew drink, and as<br>far as in him lay to act as guardian to his brother and sisters, now<br>deprived of both parents. Indeed, the secne, especially of their part-<br>ing, was a most affecting one. He expressed a wish to see them all<br>once more before his execution, which we have no doubt will be grant-<br>ed. He was much surprised at the growth of his youngest child,<br>whom he had not seen since his committal.<p>Every kindness is shown him by the excellent Governor of the<br>prison, and we need scarcely say that the " bread and water" part of<br>the sentence is disregarded. A turnkey remains in the cell day and<br>night. We believe the report of the judge, with the recommendation<br>of the jury, has been sent to the Secretary of State ; but there is not<br>the remotest expectation that the recommendation will be listened to.<br>In fact it is felt that, if the sentence were remitted in this case, it<br>would be all but tanatomount to an abrogation of capital punishment.<br>The poor man himself seems to entertain feeble hope of a change in<br>the sentence. We rejoice however that the true spirit is among the<br>people. A petition has been got up and is numerously signed, pray-<br>ing for a mitigation of the sentence, which we hope may be successful.<br>We heard a lady-looking wretch say yesterday on the mound, that<br>she would sign the petition if it would hang the dog, so much for the<br>fine feelings of the ladies of Edinburgh.<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;M'Intosh & Co., Printers, Edinburgh.</p>
