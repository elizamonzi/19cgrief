Courant.<p>A young lady, of considerable personal attractions and now about<br>nineteen years old, and who, on coming of age, will be entitled to an<br>independent fortuue of her own of about five hundred pounds a-year,<br>living  in great respectability with her father at Kensington, had been<br>for some time persecuted with the addresses and attention of Captain<br>M., who had in some measure been received by her family as a suitor<br>for her hand. He had, however, lately shown considerable jealousy<br>of her, and had displayed much violence of temper. On Saturday<br>last, Miss------had been making a morning call on a lady in the<br>neighbourhood, whose husband returned home with her to her<br>father's house, and, in a very short time after, Captain M. arrived,<br>and, on learning she had just returned home, accompanied by a<br>gentleman, betrayed the greatest agitation and passion, and, pro-<br>ducing a brace of pistols from his pocket, declared to Miss------,<br>that, had he met her with the gentleman, he would have blown his<br>brains out with one pistol and have destroyed himself with the o-<br>ther. He then urged her, as a proof of her sincerity, to take a walk<br>with him. She, however, became alarmed at his violence, and en-<br>deavoured to excuse herself; she, however, by his threats and inti-<br>midations, at length consented to go, but her alarm was so great,<br>that under an excuse of arranging some parts of her dress, she had<br>an opportunity of retiring for a few minutes, during which time<br>she desired her man-servant to follow her wherever she went, with-<br>ont letting Captain M. observe him, and should she be obliged to<br>get into a coach, he was to take one also, as she was alarmed at<br>Captain M.'s conduct. They had not walked far before she was<br>put into a coach by Captain M. ; the servant, however, could not<br>find another coach to get into, but, at the instant, an omnibus go-<br>ing the same way, he got into it, thinking he should be able to<br>keep the coach in sight; in this, however, he did not succeed, and<br>on coming into the city lost all trace of his young mistress. In<br>the meantime Captain M. took her from the coach to a Stratford<br>stage in Leadenhall Street, in which they weni to the Eagle and<br>Child at Forest Gate, about a mile beyond Stratford ; after they had<br>been there some time, he again persuaded her to take another walk<br>in the country, not before she had strong fears of his intending<br>something dreadful Afcer walking down the lane nearly as far as<br>Maryland Point, he became suddenly ill, and calling to her to come<br>to him, fell down. She, however, ran from him, imploring assist-<br>ance ; he constanly calling out to her to come to him. The only<br>person ne r at the instant, was an Irish woman, who Miss------<br>begged would help the gentleman ; he, however, refused to be as-<br>sisted by her, and called the more, " Mary Ann, Mary Ann, it is<br>you I want near me ;" at the same time feeling for something at<br>his breast, under his coat. His illness increased, and by this time<br>assistance arrived, and he was cenvcyed back to the Eagle and<br>Child, where he acknowledged having taken laudanum, and under<br>his coat was discovered a dagger, with which he intended to make<br>Miss------his victim. The laudanum taking effect sooner and<br>stronger than he expected, was the cause of her escape from this<br>horrid project. Mrs Mosely, the landlady of the Eagle and Child,<br>on his being brought; back, recollected hearing him say as he went<br>out, to Miss------, " Never mind, Mary Ann, our troubles in this<br>life will soon be over, and then we shall be happy in the next"<br>Medical assistance being immediately sent for from Stratford, Dr<br>Elliott and his assistant soon arrived, and although every means<br>were resorted to in order to save his life, the quantity of laudanum<br>he had taken was too powerful, although the stomach pump was<br>used within as short a time as possible.<p>Dr Elliott remained with him the whole night, and at 3 o'clock<br>on Sunday morning he died in the greatest agonies. The situation<br>of Miss -----, who was in the anjoining room, was scarcely less<br>pitiable; her friends, however, from what little information the<br>servant had been able to give, had by this time traced where she<br>was, and soon afterwards a gentleman conveyed her back to her<br>father's house. The most remarkable part of this dreadful affair is,<br>that after his deat, Miss------and her friends for the first time dis-<br>covered that he was a married man, and has a wife living. An<br>inquest was held on Tuesday on his body, at the Eagle and Child.<p>Edinburgh : Printed for John Lyons.?Price One Penny.<p></p>
