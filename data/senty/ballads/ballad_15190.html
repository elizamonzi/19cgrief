	<h2>Transcription</h2>
	<p> The sorrowful Lamentations of Willian Thomson, who is now<br>lying under the awful sentence of Death, in the Calton Jail,<br>and who is to be executed on Thursday the 1st of March, at<br>Dalkeith, with an acconut of his behaviour since his con-<br>demnation.<p>William and James Thomson, and John Fram, were condemned before the<br>High Court of Justiciciary, to be executed at Dalkeith on the 1st of March, for<br>the robbery of Mr Hunter, Farmer, betwixt Dalkeith and Musselburgh. John<br>Thomson and John Fram were both recommended to mercy by the Jury, which<br>recommendation being forwarded to the proper quarters, a respite during his<br>Majesty's pleasure arrived a few days back, these two, who received the happy in-<br>telligence, from the Magistrates, with a melancholy composure, immediateiy cast-<br>ing their eyes on their more unhappy companion. The behaviour of the whole<br>three, was very becoming their situation, and William, though he appeared very<br>sullen and melancholy for a few days after the respite was received, has to all ap-<br>pearance, given up his mind entirely to meet his doom with resignation.<p>He regrets very much, his not paying that attention to his family, that a parent<br>ought in duty to do, and already looks back on the manner in which he has spent<br>his days with horror; he is chearfully instructed in what he appears never to have<br>thought on, and is in a manner entirely ignorant of, by a number of pious and re-<br>spectable people who visits him.<p>Tir'd of the bustle of the day,<p>In solitude I hied,<br>To where, from noise and toil set free.<p>My thoughts might range at wide.<br>By yon dark Jail I passed along,<p>For criminals prepar'd,<br>When from its cell a piteous sound<p>Of woe methought I heard.<br>I sped to whence it did proceed,<p>The words distincter grew,<br>A Thief thus his fate bewail,d,<p>And did for mercy sue.<p>" Lock'd are the golden gates of day,<p>Tis thine, O night, ! 'o keep,<br>Morpheus, in velvet's soft array;<p>Has hush'd the busy world to sleep.<br>To me no calm like this is known<p>Sleep from my eyes has ever fled,<br>Conscience its snaky head has raised,<p>And all my sins before me led.<br>Far from my wretched mind has hope<p>On fleetest pinions soar'd away ;<br>No comfort left my state to cheer,<br>No balm my anguish to allay.<p>Companions in my revels, think<p>What you are now, and soon must be,<br> For God has me a warning made,<p>That speaks with solemn voice to thee<br>Before to morrow's sun slrall risc<p>To cheer the world, ah! who can tell,<br>But death may plunge your trembling souls<p>Down to the realms where devils dwell<br>Oh ! can you bear the dreadful thought,<br> <br>Should God this night your souls require,<br>Can you endure eternal wrath,<p>Or bear the pangs of quenchless fire ?<br>O ! Pow'r Divine. my sins forgive :<p>Thour't gracious, grace extend to me,<br>That when my flesh is tutned to nought,<p>My spirit may be, Lord, with thee.<br>A few short days, and I am plac'd<p>Beyond  the reach of mortal woe ;<br>Protect my family in that trying hour,<p>That they may Satan overthrow.<br>Farewell my children, friends, and all,<p>For you my tears in torrents fell,<br>Forgive the effnsions of my love,<p>We part in hope to meet above.<br>1827</p>
