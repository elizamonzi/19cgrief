	<h2>Transcription</h2>
	<p> An account of the Execution of Wil-<br>liam Buchanan and William M'Leod<br>and Thomas Donaldson, at Aberdeen<br>on Friday 23d May 1823, with the<br>affecting seperation with their Parents<br>and Relations, also a most pathetic<br>speech made by Buchanan on the<br>Scaffold, a genteel young Man belong-<br>ing to Edinburgh.<p>Aberdeen Saturday 24th 1823.<p>It is our painful task to state the awful example exhibited here<br>yesterday, in the revolting spectacle, wholly unprecedented in.<br>this place, of three unfortunate young men expiating their crimes<br>by an ignominious death. The unhappy criminals were Thomas<br>Donaldson, William Buchanan, and William M'Leod, convicted<br>at the last Circuit Court of the crimes of theft and southrief.<p>Buchanan, now aged 20, was born in Fiseshire, of honest and<br>respectable parents. He for some time adhered to the maxims<br>laid down for him. and prosecuted with steadiness the business of<br>a book printer in a respectable house in Edinburgh. Fom the<br>influence of bad company and other causes, he threw his business<br>at his heels and went to London, and after 2 years absence re-<br>turned to his friends in Edinburgh. Now, lost to habits of so-<br>briety and industry, he left his father's house, and coming north.<br>ward, got acquainted with the family of the Donaldsons, in the<br>parish of Ellon, and with his fellow sufferer of that name, now 25.<br>Maclepd, a native of this place, aged 27, was the son of a soldier<br>who died 5 years ago.<p>Buchanan, whose unhappy fate was unknown to his relations,<br>whom he had hitherto concealed, and from whom he had been<br>estranded about 4 years, now divulged the secret by a letter to<br>an aunt on the subject. His disconsolate father immediately<br>wrote a most pathetic letter to his nnhappy son. expressive of the<br>agonised feelings of his parents. Impelled by maternal solicitude.<br>although weighed down with the most poignant grief, hastened<br>from Edinburgh, accompanied by his two brothers, to pay their last sad<br>offices to the unhappy object of their lamentation. The scene was betwixt<br>them, on Sunday last, was in the utmost degree affecting?their cries<br>were heard to a distance; Imagination alone can can paint their horrors.<br>As the fatal day approached, they were occasionally agitated,<br>and shcwed in one or two instances considerable disquietitude,<br>but in the early part of the week a letter was shewn to them<br>from the Lord Justice Clerk, that merey could not be granted<br>them in this world, they became quite resigned to their fate.<br>On the Tuesday afternoon they took farewell of their parents<br>and relations, and a more heart-rending scene could not be wit-<br>nessed. To the Rev. Dr Kid. the Rev. Mr Penman, and the<br>Rev. Mr Thom, they expressed Themselves very sensible as well<br>as grateful, for their fatherly care and unceasing endeavours for<br>their spiritual welfare.<p>The night before the execution proved nearly sleepless to the<br>dying men. At a quarter past two p. m. they entered the old<br>court House, discovering great fortitude, attended by the above<br>mentioned clergymen, the criminals were all genteely dressed in<br>black, which had been raised by subscription by some young<br>men of Aberdeen. The magistrates took their place and the<br>procession advanced about 5 minutes from 3, A portion of the<br>23d psalm was then sung, in which the prisoners and part of the<br>people joined. A most impressive prayer was given by the Rev<br>Mr Thorn. Buchanan now stepped forward to the front of the<br>scaffold, and addressed the people for a considerable time in en-<br>ergetic and feeling language. He deeply deplored the vices of<br>his youth, and lamented in bitter terms his disregard and diso-<br>bedience of the kind injunctions of his worthy parents. To the<br>breach of the Sabbath, and neglect of the scriptures, he attribut<br>ed his many backslidings, warning the youth in particular, and<br>others, against the neglect of those sacred obligations, to which<br>he said many modern books of infidelity were great inlets if not<br>incentives. These and other pious sentiments delivered by a<br>genteel young man within a few minutes of his death, had a<br>powerful effect on the people.<p>The other two followed in much the same terms.<br>About 25 minutes past 3 they ascended the drop, and after<br>the executioner had adjusted the rope, he shook hands with<br>them, and immediately after they dropt the fatal signal, and<br>were launched into eternity, without the least struggle. Ow-<br>ing to their examplary behaviour since they had been condemned<br>a number of young men, in token of respect, attended the corpses<br>to the grave.</p>
