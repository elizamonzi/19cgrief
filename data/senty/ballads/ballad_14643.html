	<p> Horrid Murder!<p>A full, true and particular Account of that most<br>Atrocious and Horrid Murder, committed on<br>the body of a respectable old gentleman of the<br>name of Millie, in the neighbourhood of Cupar,<br>in Fife; together with the apprehension of his<br>man-servant, named Henderson, on suspicion of<br>having perpetrated this barbarous deed, and who<br>is now lodged in Cupar Jail.<p>(From the Edinburgh Observer.)<p>A  MURDER of a very horrid and atrocious<br>description has just been discovered in the<br>neighbourhood of Cupar, in Fife.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; About ten or<br>twelve&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;days&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ago&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;respectable  old  gentleman,<br>named Millie, who resided there, in a house sur-<br>rounded  by a garden and park, disappeared  in a<br>somewhat&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;mysterious&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;manner;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;suspicion<br>having been excited that he was murdered, search<br>was made in his grounds, when his body, muti-<br>lated by a hammer, or some such instrument, was<br>found buried in his garden.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A man, who acted,<br>as we have heard, as his servant, and whose name<br>is Henderson, has been appreheaded on suspicion<br>of having perpetrated this horrible crime, and is<br>now in Cupar Jail.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To these facts we are enabled<br>to add the following particulars :....On  Tuesday<br>last, (the 20th July instant,) a most respectable in-<br>dividual in this city (Edinburgh) received a parcel,<br>addressed to his  care, directed for the murdered<br>man, of whom he had no knowledge whatever.<br>This parcel the sheriff-officers subsequently traced<br>to the coach-office, and from thence to the place<br>where it had been delivered, when it was instantly<br>handed over to them in the same state that it had<br>been received; and yesterday (Monday, July 26,)<br>the clerks at the coach-office, and the gentleman<br>alluded to, were examined here by the authorities.<br>The parcel, we understand, contained charters and<br>other documents relative to the murdered man's<br>property, and is supposed to have been dispatched<br>by his murderer from Cupar a day or two subse-<br>quent to his disappearance?probably with&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the<br>view of misleading enquirers.<p>Second Edition, Observer Office, 4  o'clock P.M.<p>Mr Millie was what was called a damask customer weaver~ that<br>is, a weaver who weaves for families~at Whin Park, near Monimail,<br>six miles from Cupar.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He usually employed one or two journey-<br>men, who boarded in the house.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He had been missing for about a<br>month, and his absence was accounted for by Henderson, the man<br>who is charged with the murder, and who resided in the house as a<br>journeyman, on the ground that he had gone to Edinburgh to su-<br>perintend a law process against Lord Leven.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The deceased being<br>rather an eccentric character, and disposed to be litigious, this story<br>was credited for some time~and the more readily because Hender-<br>son still  continued  to reside in the house.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It being known, how-<br>ever, that Henderson was previously short of cash, the circumstance<br>of his appearing much better  supplied than formerly, began to ex-<br>cite notice.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; An inquiry was  consequently instituted, and  on  Sa-<br>turday the body of Millie was found buried in his own garden.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On<br>that day Henderson told a neighbour that Millie had returned home,<br>but had  been&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;obliged  to go  to&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cupar,  from  whence  he would<br>be back in the evening.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  An hour or two after Henderson dissa-<br>peared, and search commenced.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On entering the house indications<br>were visible of an attempt to dig into the floor, which was of clay,<br>but the house being founded on a rock, the earth had been  opened<br>only to the depth of a foot, when the digger encountered  that in-<br>surmouutable&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;obstruction.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  The  search  being  transferred to the<br>garden, the body  was  discovered as  already  stated,?ouried in a<br>foot-path leading to a well.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The path was so beaten that,  but for<br>an accidental circumstance,  the  discovery  would  probably  never<br>have been made.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Information having been given to the  Sheriff-<br>Substitute, he instantly repaired to the scene of crime, and  institut-<br>ed an investigation, which&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; led to the pursuit of Henderson,  who<br>was apprehended at Dunfermline,  on  Sunday morning?of which<br>town he is a native.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He denies all knowledge of the murder,<p>Printed for Felix O'Neill.<p></p>
