	<h2>Transcription</h2>
	<p> The last Speech and dying  declaration of JAMES HENDERSON, late<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <p>in Bainshole, who was executed at Aberdeen, on Friday the 29th day<br>of October 1790, for the murder of Alexander Gillespie, Slater, and<br>his body given to the Surgeons to be dissected. <p>Aberdeen, printed by James Chalmers.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  Glasgow, re printed.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <p>I JAMES HENDERSON, aged  about fifty<br>years, was born  in the town of Huntly, and<br>county of Aberdeen,  of honest and&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;creditable<br>purents, who gave me a good and Christian edu-<br>cation, according to the best of their power. Hap-<br>py is it For them that they are not now living to<br>be witnesses of my shameful and ignominious end !<br>As soon as&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was able  to do any thing,-I got a<br>small pack, and travelled the country for a few<br>years, as a chapman.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In  this trade I by my in-<br>dustry and sobriety contrived to lay by&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;as much<br>as enabled me to set  up shop in the town of Insch,<br>where  I resided  tor several years.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But misfor-<br>tunes came on me by losses and bad debts, which<br>occasioned me to fall behind hand, and my affairs<br>grew worse and worse, till at length my creditors<br>took all I had, and rouped me out  of house and<br>hald.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;About this time I took a fever, and was so<br>had, that  my reason was hurt, and was for some<br>months out of my senses, when I was put under<br>the care of she Doctor at Tocher, by whose  skill,<br>under the blessing of God, I was again restored<br>to the use of my reason, though destitute of mo-<br>ney or  means, and  forced to  begin&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the World<br>afresh<p>I betook myself to travelling the country again,<br>and  for more  than seven years  followed my for-<br>mer occupation.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  But  at langth I thought it time<br>to settle, and accordingly  married  and took pos-<br>session of Benshole, where I had a small shop for<br>such goods as suited the country; and as it could<br>not be expected that I could get much change in<br>that remote place,  so as to support my family, I<br>also kept a public house, and between both trades<br>I earned a decent subsistence.<p>I now come to the unfortunate accident Which<br>brings me to this deplorable end, and I solemnly<br>swear, on the word of a dying man who must in a<br>very short space appear before his Maker, that<br>whatever I did in this unhappy matter, was in<br>SELF-DEFENCE, and that I  had neither malice<br>nor ill-will at Alexander Gillespie, nor any other<br>man.<p>It was sworn on my trial by a beggar boy, that<br>Gillespie came to my house seeking a drain, and<br>that I struck him acress the head with an axe,<br>which killed him. If this was true, I must have<br>been a monster of iniquity indeed, to kill a man<br>standing peaceably in my house without any pro-<br>ill . No-other witness but this vagrant boy<br>coule say they saw me strike him; and his testi-<br>mony was so contradicted in circumstances by the<br>other witnesses, that no stress could be laid on it.<br>I therefore proceed to narrate this unhappy aflair<br>as it really happened; and I hope the world will<br>credit  my narration. I have no tempration now<br>to tell an untruth ; and it would be an awful thing<br>to go out of the world into the  presence of the<br>great  Judge of all the earth, with a lie in my right<br>hand.<p>I was awakened in the night between Saturday<br>and Sunday,the 10th and 11th of July last, by the<br>noise  of  breaking one of my Windows, by throw-<br>of stones  at it. I immediately got up and saw a<br>man almost half in at the Window ; on which I<br>took up a sharp slate stone which he had thrown<br>in, and struck him on the  back of the  head&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;on<br>which he fell down, and I  took him to the back<br>of the house, Where he was found by the people<br>when they came up, I understand many people still<br>believe that I gave Gellespie his mortal wounds<br>With an axe ; but let them consider that a thin<br>sharp slate stone will cut as clean as a knife; and<br>that there is hardly any other kind of stones in that<br>neighbourhood ; so that he himself furnished the<br>fatal instrument which brought him and me to an<br>untimely end.<p>I shall only say, that it is well known in the<br>country, that his character was none of the best;<br>and if I had been allowed, I could have proved<br>that breaking of windows, was no new thing to him.<br>But now there is no help, and I must subrnit to<br>my hard fate.<p>I hope none will be so cruel as to cast up rny<br>sorrowful fate to my distressed wife and family : I<br>hope the Lord will support her and them under<br>their afflictions ; and that he who is the father of<br>the fatherless, and the widow's shield, will be<br>their God and guide.<p>I return my sincere thanks to the ministers of<br>all denominations, who have visited me since I was<br>condemned. I hope the pains they have taken to<br>point out to me the way to eternal life, will re-<br>dound to the glory and praise of their heavenly<br>Master and to my everlasting happiness.<p>To the keeper of the tolbooth and his servants<br>I desire to return thanks for their humanity and<br>attention to me; and I pray that there kindness<br>may be returned  to them sevenfold.<p>I desire to die in peace and charity with all<br>men ; from the heart I forgive rny enemies,<br>hope for forgiveness at the awful judgement seat<br>before which I am now to appear.<p>I acknowledge that by nature I was a child of<br>wrath, and an heir of hell, dead in trespasses and<br>in sin, without God, and without hope in the<br>world, under the curse of the law, but when I<br>read these words in John chap. iii. 16, 17. 18,<br>and that " God who commanded the light to shine<br>" out of darkness," shined in my heart, to give<br>me the knowledge of salvation by the remission of<br>sins according to first  John c v, v, 10. " so that I<br>" know when my spirit is absent from my body it<br>''shall be present with the Lord," I long for that<br>happy time, when I shall behold my God in glory<br>in the land of uprightness.<p> As the Lord in his providence has made me a<br>example, it is my earnest prayer, that my death<br>may.be of service to others, and that every on<br>may see and know that there is a God that judgeth<br>in the earth. It would comfort me [&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;] by<br>my terrible  exit one person in this multiude might<br>turn from his sins unto God.<p>And new, O Lord Jesus, I turn to thee, Hea<br>thou my last words. Remember me, now tha<br>thou art in thy kingdom, and be merciful to me<br>this day; receive my sinful soul into the arms o<br>thy mercy, and grant that my sufferings in this life<br>being ended, I may be blessed in the enjoyment o<br>thee to  all eternity. Amen and Amen. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  <br>JAMES HENDERSON</p>
