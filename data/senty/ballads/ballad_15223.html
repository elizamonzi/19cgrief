"<br>I thought my liberty I had got,<br>But with sorrow was deceiv'd,<br>For when in jail that I awoke,<br>Still was there unrelieved.<br>O cruel and bloody that I was,<br>To think on killing men,<br>And that without the slightest cause,<br>Decoyed them to my den.<br>Such thoughts as these were what I made,<br>After that I had awoke,<br>But let it ne'er again be said,<br>That there lives such a rogue.<br>O silent sleep,--I'll ne'er sleep again,<br>To think on't makes me shiver ;<br>What tortures and what cruel pain,--<br>Forget it shall I never.<br>And whether in night's silent hour,<br>Or in the sun shine day,<br>Still will remain at my mind's door,<br>Till I the debt of nature pay.<p>PRICE ONE PENNY.<p>THE ONLY AUTHENTIC EDITION<p>OF THE<p>TRIAL OF BURKE AND M'DOUGAL.<p>THE PUBLISHEAS, in compliance with the urgent desire of  their nn-<p>merous friends, have determined to bring out, in Two Parts,<p><p>A FULL AND CORRECT REPORT<p>(Taken in Short Hand by Mr. John M'Nee)<p>OF THE CASE OF<br>WILLIAM BURKE  & HELEN  McDOUGAL, <p>WHO WERE<p>Tried before the High Court of Justiciary on Wednesday the 24th<p>December  current,<p>FOR  THE<p>MURDER OF MARGERY CAMPBELL,<p>Under the most Peculiar Circumstances.<p>This FIRST PART contains an ORIGINAL PREFACE,including cu-<br>rious particulars of the pannels, and Hare and his wife; the in-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>dictment; List of witnesses; List of the Assiso; the Speeches of<br>THE COUNSEL and the Opinions of THE JUDGES on the Relevancy<br>of the Indictment; a Portion  of the Evidence, both Question and<br>Answer, &c.&c.illustrated with CORRECT LIKENESSES of the PAN-<br>NELS, and HARE, their Associate, taken when at the Bar.<p>PART SECOND, completing the Publication, will be published with<br>the utmost despatch consistent with accuaracy, and will contain the <br>remainder of the Evidence, the luminous and brilliant Speeches of <br>the LORD ADVOCATE,DEAN of FACULTY, and Mr. HENRY COCK-<br>BURN, accompanied with a Plan of the Premises, a View of the <br>Interior of Burke's House, as it appeared the day after the Trial, a <br>fac-simile of Burke's Handwriting Title, Contents, &c. & c.<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Publishers beg respectfully to announce, that the Opinions <br>of the Learned JUDGES who presided, and the Speeches delivered by <br>the eminent COUNSEL for the Crown and the Pannels, engaged in <br>this extraordinary Case, have been BY THEM MOST OBLIGINGLY RE-<br>VISED. They trust this anxiety to give as full and  authentic a report  <br>as can be produced, will give their edition a decided superiority over<br>every other. <p>Printed for R.BUCHANAN, 26, George Street; W.HUNTER, 23,<br>Hanover street; and J.STEVENSON, 87, Prince's Street, Edinburgh.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  <p><br>We understand that the investigation into the late criminal trans-<br>actions has been renewed, and is still continued with unabated industry.<br>On Monday several of the anatomical teachers met with the Lord Advo-<br>cate, at his request. This meeting was confidential; but its<br>object was no doubt to procure such information as might prove useful<br>in bringing out a more full disclosure of the late nefarious transactions.<p>--Edinburgh Evening Post. <br></p>
