	<p> The Bonny Lass of Branksome.<p>As I came in by Tiviot side<br>and by the braes of Branksome<br>There met I with a pretty Lass,<br>that was both neat and handsome:<br>If that her mother say me nay<br>then with the Daughter will I play,<br>Weather that she  will or nay&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>have at the bonny Lassie<br>Dame gar fill to us more Beer<br>for lo here is more Money<br>And for our reckoning do not fear<br>so long as we have any.<br>Gar fill the Cup gar fill the Can<br>Here is a Health to our Good-Man,<br>We shall be merry e'er we gang<br>have at the bonny Lassie.<p>I dream'd before it came to pass<br>that I would find her willing,<br>But yet I knew not what she was,<br>though she and I were Wooing,<br>My Thought any Mind and mine Intent<br>To seek that Lass was ready bent:<br>At last by order we were sent;<br>to quarter up at Branksome.<br>Her hastily I did espy,<br>though I was but a stranger,<br>A Ribband about her Arm I did ty<br>and told her of her Danger.<br>Sweet Heart I have sought many place<br>Yet never could I see thy Face,<br>Take pity and relieve my Case,<br>my pretty bonny Lassie.<p>I need not to conceal my Name<br>I'm Born within this Nation:<br>Bred in great Honour Wealth & Fame<br>and of high Estimation.<br>Great Nobles were my Cousins near,<br>And I a Noble Man of weir<br>Therfore be Merry & make good Chear<br>my pretty bonny Lassie.<br>Then did she say my only joy,<br>I will give you Contentment,<br>If you will be my Venus Boy:<br>and give me no Affrontment.<br>Twill credit me and all my Kin,<br>If I your Love and Favour win,<br>My happiness shall then begin<br>when you my Fancy pleasure.<p>My Father and Mother will be glad,<br>to you they have Relation;<br>Because you are a boony Lad,<br>and well Born in this Nation<br>You shall dispose of half their Gear,<br>And Money get to spend by Year,<br>Both Meal and Malt Corn and Bear,<br>for your sweet bonny Lassie.<br>He says I court you not for Wealth<br>for I have Gold and Money,<br>But I had rather have thy self,<br>for thou art neat and bonny:<br>Sweet Heart I'le be content of you,<br>if that they give me but a Cow,<br>And I to you do make a Vow,<br>to be thy Venus servant.<p>It is not for thy Fathers Gear,<br>nor for thy worldly Riches,<br>That I am come a suiter here,<br>that we Two may be matches.<br>For I may have Lady fair,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>Whose Friends would gladly give me Gear<br>She hath Five Hundred Merks a Year<br>beside my just Proportion.<br>The Lass with smileing Lips then said<br>this is a true Narration,<br>That many a gallant lusty Lad,<br>to me bears such Relation:<br>Yea many an able pretty Man<br>Would gladly give to me their Hand,<br>And bow and be at my Command,<br>but fortune now doth cross them.<p>Now well's me of my pretty Lass,<br>that has so soon consented,<br>I was but short while in that place,<br>while she grew loving hearted.<br>My gallant proper handsom Dove,<br>That was not strange and ill to Woo,<br>But presently did  yield and bow,<br>and granted me my asking:<br>Sweet Sir I could not say you hay,<br>you are so well accounted,<br>My Maidenhead bad me give way,<br>when I saw you so mounted,<br>With Horse and harness, Spear & Shield<br>And venus caused me to yeild,<br>'Mongst all my Woers I you weild,<br>because you were so Gentle.<p>There's many Suiters came to me<br>before your Love began Sir,<br>And bore me frequent Company,<br>but they no Favour wan Sir,<br>Now are they almost gone a stray,<br>With many shout and well away,<br>That ever they should have seen this Day<br>and what you do unto them.<br>I do Disdain no Gentleman<br>that's Born within this Nation,<br>For I'm a Woman of the same,<br>and of high Estimation,<br>My Mother says I am right sib<br>To the House of Branksome being Rib<br>You will be gallant Weft to Weft.<br>i'justly put together.<p>At length into the North I went<br>to visit Friends and Father:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>When I came back, some Days being spent<br>her Mother thought me braver.<br>She to her Daughter says Go Down,<br>Thy Lover now is come to Town,<br>Be kind to him, and I a Gown,<br>will give thee for thy Pains Jo,<br>To go with him I will be glad<br>or do him any pleasure.<br>Let us first Wed then go to Bed,<br>where it will wait his leasure<br>Ye do me Wrong to bid me Hast,<br>For I will Run as he me chast:<br>When Shirt is clean and Cloaths unlac'd<br>from Cold I'le strive to keep him.<p>Her Mothers bidding she obey'd,<br>and went into the Chamber;<br>Where he discours'd with her and plaid<br>without Noise or Clamour,<br>He said, my Dove thou hast some Skill<br>And bearest Company with Goodwill<br>I wish I might remain here still,<br>it's neither Cold nor Frosty:<br>This in the Place which I do love:<br>and is well kept in Order:<br>And no Man this will disapprove,<br>that lives in Southern border<br>Where nothing is of Iron or Brass,<br>Then freely will I let you pass,<br>And hold you for a pretty Lass,<br>for keeping all so cleanly.<p>Your Uncle is no Friend to me,<br>I have him at Envy:<br>He said I laid my Love too high,<br>before some Company.<br>But what ado had he think ye;<br>To meddle with my Love and me<br>For Love is laid in each Degree<br>have at the bonny Lassie.<br>Sweet Sir I was once sore afraid<br>you had delay'd your coming,<br>Your tarrying made me sore afraid,<br>I weary was with mourning.<br>But now I neither tire nor irk,<br>To bear you Compn'y in the Mirk,<br>Then gar proclaim us in the Kirk,<br>and we shall wed together.<p>Each one said you would not return<br>nor come into this Nation:<br>Which daily made me for to mourn<br>with grievous lamentation,<br>But seeing you'r come back again<br>Of your coming I'm right sain,<br>And altogether free of Pain<br>ye shall ly in my Bosom<br>When ye into the Country came<br>o then but ye were bonny,<br>My Mother took you in her Arms,<br>and said you were her honey,<br>Then unto Hawick did we gang<br>And of the Way we thought not Long,<br>Of us composed was the Song<br>My pretty bonny Lassie.<p>FINIS.</p>
