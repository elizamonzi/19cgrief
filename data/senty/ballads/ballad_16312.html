	<h2>Transcription</h2>
	<p> A full and particular Account of some late Engagements with the Rebels, in which<br>they lost several hundred Men, copied from Letters, lately received from Gentlemen<br>in the Sutherland Fencibles, with many other particulars respecting the Proceedings<br>of his Majesty's Forces against the Rebels-also a Copy of a Letter from an Officer<br>at Wexford, giving an Account of some horrid Barbarities committed by the Insur-<br>gents before the Reduction of that Place, never  before known.<p>Extract of a Letter from a Gentleman in the Suther-<br>land Fencibles, to his Friend in Edinburgh, dated<br>Drogheda, July 22,<p>" Information having been received by our Gene-<br>ral, that the rebels were within a few miles of the<br>town, the General ordered our light company and<br>some troops of cavalry to meet them. The rebels,<br>however, were informed of our coming, which made<br>them retreat; and we marched from six in the even-<br>ing till five o'clock in the morning, when another<br>express informed, that the Rebels were within six<br>miles of us, plundering and burning all the Orange-<br>men's houses, we set off and pursued them for that day,<br>and next night, till the morning of the 14th, when they<br>formed a line of battle, and left their plunder behind<br>them. They only stood to fire one volley, and then<br>retreated; when we charged them, and the cavalry<br>surrounded them; no quarters, no mercy was shewn.<br>" General Wemyss came up with four companies<br>of our own Regiment, which encouraged the light<br>company to pursue the Rebels for the space of two hours.<br>It is reported there were 400 rebels killed on the spot,<br>and I believe it to be true, as they had no way to<br>escape,"<p>Another letter from a sergeant in the same regiment,<p>to his Friend in Glasgow.<p>" Our pursuit after the Rebels was for three days<br>and three nights without halting ; we, accompanied<br>by the Dumfriesshire cavalry, at last came up with<br>them, and engaged them for  four hours, and killed a<br>considerable number, which we could not exactly as-<br>certain, as the action happened in a corn field and a-<br>mong mosses. The rebels were supposed to amount<br>to 600, who were almost all killed ; about 30 of them<br>only escaped from the action; 10 of these we after-<br>wards took prisoners, and 4 of them were hanged on<br>our return home. General Wemyss, and all the Of-<br>cers, could not restrain our regiment. There was not<br>one of the Sutherlandmen hurt. The Dumfries ca-<br>valry had one killed an six dangerously wounded,"<p>Extract of a letter from Navan, dated July 20, giv-<br>ing an account of the late engagement with the re-<br>bels near Trim.<p>" Information having been brought on Wednes-<br>day, that a large body of the rebels were ravaging the<br>country beyond Trim, on Thursday morning, lieu-<br>tenant colonel Ord of the Durham, or Princess of<br>Wales Light Dragoons, with his own and captain<br>Usher's troop, marched from Navan and joined the<br>forces at Trim; about nine miles from it, they came<br>up with between three or four thousand of the rebels<br>?from the nature of the country, the cannon and in-<br>fantry could not get up, but the cavalry repeatedly<br>charged them in the rear, killed a great many, and<br>took considerable booty; in the evening, however,<br>their main body got away. Our troops having re-<br>ceived a reinforcement from Drogheda, the rebels<br>were pursued and overtaken on Saturday forenoon, at<br>a place called Williamstown ; they were charged by<br>the advanced guard of cavalry, and drove out of the<br>town with dreadful slaughter; the infantry attacked<br>their flanks, and killed a great many; the whole body<br>of the rebels were completely dispersed and defeated;<br>no prisoners were taken, The rebels sometimes<br>fought desperately I saw some of them, when sur-<br>rounded, and having fired away all their ammunition,<br>continue throwing stones till they were cut down.<p>" Near Ballyriggen, it is mentioned, the yeo-<br>manry of that neihbourhood came up with a party of<br>rebels, and killed  200 of them."<p> Extract  of a letter from an Officer of the Regi-<br>ments stationed at Wexford, to his friend in Edin-<br>burgh, dated Wexford, July 19.<br>" We have been hard worked for these last six<br>weeks.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For more than three of these I have not had<br>off my clothes, and a little straw and a blanket has been,<br>my constant bed, and that sometimes in the open<br>fields, and others only with a soldier's tent over me.<br>We are now tolerably quiet, and hardly expect to be<br>again troubled with the Croppies- The numbers of<br>the Rebels under arms in this county were immense,<br>there could not be less than 60,000 in their different<br>camps, and these mostly with pikes.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the different<br>actions our loss has been very trifling compared to<br>theirs.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The proportion of Officers to men has been<br>out of all bounds, they constantly making us their<br>chief aim.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The aspect of this country is dreadful,<br>Not a house except in this  neighbourhood, either in<br>the villages or country, that is not either burnt to the<br>ground or plundered of every thing?the former more<br>frequently.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I do not think I saw ten men in the<br>whole county that were not with the Rebels, and not<br>one person at work in the fields.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The destruction of<br>cattle has been beyond all  bounds; those vagabonds<br>frequently merely eating one leg of a cow, and leav-<br>ing the remainder to rot in the fields.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Their cruel-<br>ties have exceeded all belief in a country called Chris-<br>tian.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The day before we took this place, they car-<br>ried from the jail to the bridge ninety-two Protestant-<br>gentlemen and others, whom they piked with the<br>most refined cruelty, beginning at the extremities and<br>joints, and not the vital parts, for a considerable length<br>of time.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One man in particular they thus piked, and<br>left him lying in the street all night: In the morning<br>they found him alive and again begun by stabbing him<br>in the old wounds before they gave him the mortal<br>stab.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Another, a Mr. Sparrow, one of the most re-<br>spectable Gentlemen in town, after murdering him<br>they threw him over the bridge so at low water you saw<br>him, mangled in a most inhuman manner,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; All this,<br>however, you will cease  to  wonder at, when  I tell<br>you that on the morning of the day we took Enniscor-<br>thy and Vinegar Hill, when they found they were<br>likely to be driven from the town, to prevent their<br>sick and wounded from falling into our hands, and<br>their making discoveries, they set the house on fire,<br>and left the whole of these poor wretches to be con-<br>sumed in the flames.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Our garrison is composed of<br>the 2d and 29th foot, the Dumbartonshire Fencibles,<br>and Mid Lothian Cavalry.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We are basied daily in<br>trying and hanging the Rebels&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; many wealthy men.<br>have been already tucked up.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Their property, it is<br>imagined, will go to pay, in part, the losses of the<br>poor loyalists.?-Gen. Lake having offered pardon to<br>those Rebels who would give up their leaders and sur-<br>render their arms, many have taken advantage of this<br>offer,  and returned&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;their common  avocations<br>within these few days, I am afraid more from necessity<br>than good intentions.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In some of their actions the<br>Rebels ran up to the very mouths of the cannon and<br>were blown to atoms.?-This, however, did not deter<br>others from attempting the same frequently in the<br>some actions; their Priests, who headed them, by<br>promising no harm, and a thousand other lies, thus<br>urging them on.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One of these worthy prelates took<br>up a handful of dust, and blowing it into the air, told<br>them,  that a bullet  would make  no more  im-<br>pression on them than that dust.<p>" This they were soon convinced, however, was<br>a mistake; for he amongst many others, were left<br>dead  on the field."</p>
