	<p> INHUMAN<p>ATROCITY!<p>A Full and Particular ACCOUNT of a most<br>HORRID and INHUMAN MURDER,<br>committed a few days ago, at Sunnybrae,<br>Parish of Saline, in Fife, on the Body of a<br>New Born Infant, by its own Unnatural<br>Mother, who put it on a large Fire, by which<br>it was nearly consumed before Discovered !<p>The following Paragraph, copied from " The Edinburgh<br>Observer," this morning, is truly shocking to the feelings of<br>humanity, and is, we have reason to be thankful, of very<br>rare occurrence in this part of the British Empire. That a si-<br>milar barbarous, unnatural, and horrid circumstance may never<br>occur here again, is our most sincere and fervent wish, for the<br>honour of humanity, as well as for that of our native country.<p>" Inhuman Atrocity.?A few days ago, a young woman, residing at Sunny-<br>brae, parish of Saline, had an illegitimare child, and in order to avoid the shame<br>which an exposure of her situation might have drawn upon her, barbarously<br>murdered the innocent infant in a manner at which human nature shudders.<p>" The unhappy mother lived under the same roof with an old woman, whose<br>apartment was separated only by a thin partition, on whom she called to come<br>and make her a warm drink, but prohibited her from preparing it at the fire of<br>the room they were in, saying that she had just heaped on a large fire to warm<br>the house, which she was unwilling to have touched or broken down. The old<br>woman was surprised on finding a very disagreeable smell issuing from the<br>fire, and after repeatedly interrogating the sick female, without obtaining any<br>satisfactory answer, turned up the coals, and to her unspeakable horror, found<br>in the midst of them, the half-consumed remains of the unnatural parent's<br>inhumanity.<p>" There being no assistance near, the wretched infanticide made her escape<br>next morning, and was seen in Dunfermline on the evening of that day, the<br>report of her crime not having then spread so far. Every exertion hae been<br>made to discover her, but as yet without success. Her parents are alive and<br>respectable."....Edinburgh Observer, 26th October, 1822.<p>We are sorry to have to say, that we have repeatedly read of the murder of<br>infants, in such a cruel and inhuman manner as the above, happening in some<br>other parts of the word at a distance ; but never, that we recollect of, so near<br>home. May the wretched mother be brought to a  proper sense of her awful si-<br>tuation, ere it be too late?may she be brought to a speedy repentauce, and ob-<br>tain forgiveness of her manifold sins, through the mediation of her crucified<br>Saviour, from Him who is alone able and willing to pardon the greatest crimi-<br>nal ;?and, may all who read of the crimes she is said to have committed, be<br>preserved in the paths of virtue and rectitude, that they may, finally, die the<br>death of the righteous, and their latter end be like his.<p>PRICE ONE PENNY.</p>
