	<p> Trial & Sentence<p>Of Samuel Maxwell, James Donelly, Robt. Muir and Alex. Hamilton,<br>convicted of Breaking into, and Robbing the dwelling house of<br>Alex. Arniel, farmer at Caplin, in the parish of Neilston, on the I2th<br>or I3th November, 1819.<p>EDINBURGH, DECEMBER 11, 1820.<p>This day the High Court of Justiciary met, when<br>the above prisoners were placed at the bar, who seve-<br>rally pleaded Not Guilty. The first witness called, was<br>Mr. Arneil, who stated, that about midnight of the<br>12th November, 1819, he was roused out of bed by a<br>loud noise at the door, apparently proceeding from the<br>effects of some persons pressing against it; that there<br>were a number of voices demanding admittance in a tu-<br>multuous manner, and threatening death with the most<br>awful imprecations, if he refused to let them in; he ac-<br>cordingly opened the door, and three men, with their<br>faces covered with red handkerchiefs, one carrying a<br>light, and had holes cut that their eyes were visible; that<br>they hurried him along into a narrow passage, and two<br>of them stood over him, while the others were ransack-<br>ing the house; that they commanded him to go to bed,<br>which, through fear, he complied with, and saw one<br>take down a gold watch and put it into his pocket; they<br>shortly after went away, but witness was in such confu-<br>sion, that he was unable to say that any of the prisoners<br>were the persons. Hamilton had come some days be-<br>fore on pretence of purchasing potatoes, but went away<br>without making any bargain; had seen Maxwell in his<br>house as a travelling packman.<p>Jane M'William knew the prisoners; heard of the<br>robbery of Mr. Arneil's, to which, and on the night<br>previous they in company of Daniel Grant (who was<br>executed at Glasgow) and James Dollins, came to her<br>mother's house, and that they came for a sword; they<br>all seemed connected, but cannot say Donnelly was in<br>the room at the time, is certain of the others; that she<br>gave them the sword herself; beard them speaking<br>among themselves, as if they were hesitating whether<br>they should go or not; Hamilton said he had been there<br>and it would do well; another said it was too far, and<br>received for answer, it was only the length af Barrhead;<br>they left the house about ten o'clock; thinks she heard<br>them mention Arniel's name; witness stated that she had<br>been examined at the Circuit Court of Glasgow, in the<br>case of Grant and others, for breaking into the house<br>of Mrs. Watt, and that the sword then mentioned by<br>her was the same now referred to; that it never came<br>into the possession of her family since that; Grant came<br>and asked for it on the night of Mrs. Watt's robbery,<br>but it was then still in possession of Maxwell, &c.; be-<br>fore going out to Arniel's house she beard one of them<p>say, " what did he think of it," to which ha made an-<br>swer, " that it was really a rich booty to be expected;''<br>identified the prisoner's as having seen them in her mo-<br>ther's, and that she did not think it proper at the time<br>to inform the police.<p>James Dollins, an accomplice, was, after an admoni-<br>tion from the Lord Justice Clerk, examined, and stated<br>that he knew all the panne's. that he was present at the<br>housebreaking at Mr. Arniel's, which took place in the<br>same week in which M' Kinlay was executed at Glas-<br>gow, that there were present, besides himself, Samue<br>Maxwell, Daniel Grant, James Donnelly, Robert Mai<br>and another named Hamilton, besides a stranger; that<br>Grant, Donnelly and Maxwell had handkerchiefs about<br>their heads, and that they went round about the village<br>of Barrhead, because some of them was known; Grant<br>was armed with a sword and knife, Maxwell had a pis-<br>tol; the sword was procured from Jane M'William; it<br>was arranged that the three who had their faces cover-<br>ed should go in first, and should give a cough as a signal<br>for the others to come in: that witness and the stranger<br>stood at the door; saw Grant and Donnelly in the room<br>in which there was a  light, Maxwell bad a watch, which<br>appeared to be gold, Donnelly had a bundle, Grant car-<br>ried the sword; when they left the house they heard<br>some noise, and thought they were followed; they took<br>over the muir until they came to Johnston road, when<br>three of them went away; Maxwell gave them £3, one<br>each, and said they should have a full share when the<br>whole was divided, which he thought would be one or<br>two more; that they came to Bridgend and went into a<br>house; Maxwell and Donnelly took the watch and went<br>out and sold it, witness got £2 for his share of the<br>booty, which was paid by Maxwell next; witness iden-<br>tified the sword.<p>Several ether witnesses corroborated the above evi-<br>dence, and the Jury returned a verdict finding the<br>charge against Muir and Donelly Not Proven; and<br>Maxwell and Hamilton Guilty, when they were sen-<br>tenced to be HANGED at Edinburgh on the 17th day<br>of January next. Maxwell cenfessed his guilt, but de-<br>clared that none of his fellow prisoners bad any thing<br>to do with the robbery, and hoped that Hamilton's<br>life would be spared. Hamilton was recommended to<br>mercy by the Jury, and wept bitterly on hearing the<br>sentence pronounced.<p>Printed by John Muir, Glasgow.</p>
