	<p> BURNS<p>And his Highland Mary.<p>In green Caledonia there ne'er were twa lovers,<br>Sae enraptured and happy in each ither's arms ;<br>As Burns the sweet bard, and his dear Highland Mary.<br>And fondly and sweetly he sang o' her charms.<br>And lang will his sang sae enchanting, and bonny,<br>Be heard wi' delight on his ain native plains ;<br>And lang will the sango his dear Highland Mary,<br>So secred to love in his heart-inciting strains.<p>O, 'twas a May-day and the flowers o' the simmer,<br>Were blooming in wildness a' lovely and fair ;<br>That our twa lovers met in a grove o' green bowers,<br>Which grew on the banks o' the sweet winding Ayr,<br>And O ! to thembaith 'twas a meeting fu' tender,<br>As it was the last for a while they could hae ;<br>Sae loves purest raptures they tasted together,<br>Till the red setting sun showed the close of the day.<p>O Mary, dear Mary, exclaimed her fond lover,<br>You carry my heart to the Highlands with thee ;<br>Every burnie and bank every grove and green bower,<br>May talk of the love o' my lassie and me.<br>My life's  sweetest treasure my am charming Mary,<br>To thee I'll be ever devoted and true ;<br>For the heart that is beating sae fast in this bosom,<br>Is a heart that can never love ony but you.<p>O dinna bide lang in the Highlands my Mary,<br>O d nna bide lang in the Highlands frae me,<br>for I love you sincerely I love thee o'er dearly',<br>To be happy sae far my dear Mary frae thee.<br>I  winna bide lang my lad in the Highlands,<br>I canna bide lang for you winna bo there ;<br>At the' I hae frin's I like weel in the Highlands,"<br>The ane I  love best's on the banks o' the Ayr.<p>Then he kissed her red lips they were sweeter than roses,<br>And he strained her lily-white breast to his heart ;<br>And the tears fell like dew drops at e'en on his bosom,<br>As she said my fond lover, alas ! wo maun part.<br>Then farewell, he said and he flow frae his Mary,<br>O farewell said Mary ? she could say nae mair??<br>O little they thought they had parted for ever,<br>When they parted that night on the banks o' the Ayr.<p>Yet the green simmer saw but few sunny mornings,<br>Till she in the bloom o' her beauty and pride ;<br>Was laid in her grave like a bonny young flower,<br>In Greenock kirk-yard on the bunks o' the Clyde.<br>And Burns the sweet bard o' his ain Caledonia,<br>Lamented his Mary in many a sad strain ;<br>And sair did he weep for his dear Highland Mary,<br>And ne'er did his heart love so deeply again.<p>Then bring me the lilies, and bring me the roses,<br>And bring me the daises that grow in the vale ;<br>And bring me the dew o' the mild simmer evening,<br>And bring me the breath o' the sweet scented gale,<br>And bring me the sigh o' a fond lovers bosom,<br>And bring me the tear o' a fond lovers e'e ;<br>And I'll pour them a' doun on thy grave Highland Mary,<br>For the take o' thy Burns who  dearly loved thee.</p>
