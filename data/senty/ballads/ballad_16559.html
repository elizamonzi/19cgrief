	<p> Trial & Sentence<p>Of JAMES GORDON, who is to be Executed at Dumfries, on the 6th June, 1821, for the Bar-<br>barous Murder of James Elliot, a Poor Pedlar Boy, by Knocking him on the Head with a<br>Wooden 'Clog, in a Lonely Muir, in November last.<p>DUMFRIES, APRIL 30, 1821.<p>The Court of Justiciary was opened here by<br>the Lord Justice Clerk and Lord Gillies.<p>James Gordon alias James M'Donald or<br>O'Donald,' accused of murdering John Elliot,<br>at a solitary place on the farm of Upper Cas-<br>sock, parish of Eskdalemuir, on the 14th of<br>November; 1820, was placed at the bar.<p>From the evidence it appeared that William<br>Glendinning, a lad about 15 or 16, son to Ar-<br>chibald Glendinning, tenant in Upper Cassock,<br>parish of Eskdalemuir, while employed on the<br>26th of November last, (a Sunday), in looking<br>after his father's sheep, he discovered, at a lone-<br>ly place called Steelbush Edge, the body of a<br>dead boy, who was stretched on his back on the<br>grass or bent, with one hand across his breast;<br>and the other extended on the ground. This<br>was in the afternoon of Sunday, and witness<br>immediately went home and told his Family<br>what he had seen. His father and brother, an-<br>other youth, then yoked a Cart, and accompan-<br>ied him to Steelbush-edge, where they found<br>the dead body, which they placed in a cart a-<br>midst Some Straw, and covered with an old<br>plaid, and immediately drove homewards. Mr.<br>Glendinning now sent for Mr. David Graham,<br>Surgeon in Burncleugh, who examined the body<br>when it appeared that there was a cut or con-<br>tusion on the chin, a cut above the right eye,<br>and a great many wounds on the back of the<br>head, which in the opinion of the surgeon, must<br>have been the cause of his death.<p>The same day the body was interred, the<br>witness was again on the heights, in company<br>with a neighbour herd, where he saw a pair of<br>Iron-shod clogs lying within about 14 yards of<br>the spot where Elliot's body was found. The<br>three Glendinnings, that is the father and his<br>two sons, corroborated one another in every<br>particular, as to the finding of the body, and<br>they also recollected a man and a boy coming<br>to Upper Cassock a short time before this, and<br>described pretty minutely the appearance of<br>them both. The boy carried a small red wood-<br>en box, coarsely painted, and slung from his<br>shoulders by a leather strap; and the man a<br>small barn bag, and two hare-skins. The man<br>wore clogs, or Wooden shoes, the mark of which<br>they observed in the mud and which were<br>strongly bound round with iron and also shod<br>on the heels with the same metal, and one<br>cauker being circular, and the other of the<br>shape of a horse shoe.<p>It was sometime during the afternoon of the<p>14th November that the murder had been com-<br>mitted, and one of the medical gentlemen gave<br>it as his opinion that Gordon had held one of<br>the before-mentioned ponderous clogs by the<br>heel, and beat the poor boy on the head with it<br>until he had effected his horrid purpose. He<br>had then, it would appear, dropped the clogs<br>at a short distant from the body, and carried<br>off the box, which he kept in his possession for<br>two of three days, when after rifling it, he flung<br>it into a burn on the road leading to Ettrick;<br>where it was found on the 16th of November<br>by a lad of the name of Thomas Anderson.<br>Gordon fastened himself on this unfortunate<br>youth for three days previous to the murder,<br>although they had no previous acquaintance;<br>was seen entering along with him into the Wilds.<br>of Eskdalemuir, about three o'clock in the aft-<br>ternon, and on the evening of the same day-,<br>was again seen emerging from these wilds alone;<br>and in possession of and selling articles from the<br>pack, which was identified as having belonged<br>to the murdered boy; and father, that the in-<br>instrument apparently made use of in commit-<br>ting the murder was a clog, which was on the<br>foot of Gordon when they were last seen to-<br>gether.<p>After the murder the travelled through<br>Peebles-shire, where all trace of him was lost,<br>till the month of January last; when He was<br>apprehended at Nairn, where he emitted two-<br>declarations:?In the first he denied all know-<br>ledge of Elliot, but in the other he admitted<br>having teen in company with him a short time<br>before.<p>He was found Guilty of Robbery and Mur-<br>der, and after an excellent address from the<br>Lord Justice Clerk he was sentenced to be<br>Executed on the 6th June, and that his body<br>be given to Dr. Maxwell for dissection.<p>The criminal behaved during this address in<br>a very unbecoming manner, frequently exclaim-<br>ing that he had never touched the clogs, and<br>that he had not got justice He is a native of<br>Ireland of a very forbidden aspect, about 5 feet<br>2 inches in height much marked with the small<br>pox, and apparently blind of the left eye. He<br>can neither read nor write.<p>The poor boy, a native, we believe, of Hex.<br>ham, in England, was rather weak in his intel-<br>lects, and being of a slender, delicate frame,<br>gamed his livlihood by carrying a small pack,<br>containing a few articles of hardware and Sta-<br>tionary, which, According to evidence, could<br>not have exceeded the value of a few shillings.<p>Printed by John Muir.</p>
