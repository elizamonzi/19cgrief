	<p> ST.  PETER AT THE GATE.<p>St. Peter stood guard at the golden gate,<br>With a solemn mien and an air sedate,<br>When up to the top of the golden stair<br>A man and a woman ascending there<br>Applied for admission.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They came and stood<br>Before St. Peter, so great and good,<br>In hope the City of Peace to win,<br>And asked St. Peter to let them in.<p>The woman was tall, and lank, and thin,<br>With a scraggy beardlet about her chin ;<br>The man was short, and thick, and stout,<br>His stomach was built so it rounded out,<br>His face was pleasant, and all the while<br>He wore a kind and genial smile.<br>The choirs in the distance the echoes woke,<br>And the man kept still while the woman spoke.<p>" Oh, thou who guards the gate," said she,<br>'' We two come hither beseeching thee<br>To let us enter the heavenly land<br>And play our harps with the angel band.<br>Of me, St. Peter, there is no doubt,<br>There's nothing in heaven to bar me out,<br>I've been to meetings three times a week,<br>And almost always I'd rise and speak.<p>" I've told the sinners about the day<br>When they'd repent of their evil way ;<br>I've told my neighbours?I've told them all<br>'Bout Adam and Eve and the primal fall;<br>I've shown them what they'd have to do<br>If they'd pass in with the chosen few ;<br>I've marked their path of duty clear?<br>Laid out the plan for their whole career.<p>" I've talked and talked to 'em loud and long,<br>For my lungs are good and my voice is strong ;<br>So, good St. Peter, you'll clearly see<br>That the gate of heaven is open for me ;<br>But my old man, I regret to say,<br>Hasn't walked in exactly the narrow way,<br>He smokes and he swears, and grave faults he's<br>got,<br>So I don't know whether he'll pass or not.<p>" He never would pray with an earnest vim,<br>Or go to revival, or join in a hymn ;<br>So I had to leave him in sorrow there<br>While I with the chosen united in prayer.<br>He ate what the pantry chose to afford,<br>While I in my purity sang to the Lord ;<br>And if cucumbers were all he got,<br>It's a chance if he merited them or not.<p>" But, oh, St. Peter, I love him so,<br>To the pleasure of heaven please let him go !<br>I've done enough, a saint I've been,<br>Won't that atone ?&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Can't you let him in ?<br>By my grim gospel I know 'tis so<br>That the unrepentants must fry below ;<br>But ain't there some way that you can see<br>That he may enter who's dear to me P<br>It's a narrow gospel by which I pray;<br>But the chosen expect to find some way<br>Of coaxing, or fooling, or bribing you,<br>So that their relations may amble through.<p>"And say, St. Peter, it seems to me,<br>This gate isn't kept as it ought to be.<br>You ought to stand right by the opening there,<br>And never sit down in an easy chair.<br>And say, St. Peter, my sight is dimmed.<br>But  I  don't  like  the&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;way your&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;whiskers  are<br>trimmed,<br>They're cut too wide, and outward toss ;<br>They'd look better narrow, cut straight across,<br>Well, we must be going our crowns to win,<br>So open, St. Peter, and we'll pass in."<p>St. Peter sat quiet and stroked his staff,<br>But in spite of his office he had to laugh,<br>Then said with a fiery gleam in his eye :<br>" Who's tending this gateway?you or I ?"<br>And then he rose in his stature tall,<br>And pressed a button upon the wall,<br>And said to an imp who came up aglow,<br>" Escort this woman to the regions below."<p>The man stood still as a piece of stone?<br>Stood sadly, gloomily, there alone.<br>A life-long settled idea he had,<br>That his wife was good and he was bad,<br>He thought if the woman went down below<br>That he would certainly have to go ;<br>That if she went down to regions dim,<br>There wasn't the ghost of a show for him.<br>Slowly he turned, by habit bent,<br>To follow wherever the woman went.<br>St. Peter, standing on duty there,<br>Observed that the top of his head was bare.<br>He called the gentleman back and said :<br>" Friend, how long have you been wed ?"<br>'Thirty years" (with a weary sigh),<br>And then he thoughtfully added, " Why?"<p>St. Peter was silent, with head bent down,<br>He raised his hand scratched his crown,<br>Then, seeming a different thought to take,<br>.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Slowly, half to himself, he spake :<br>'' Thirty years with that woman there ?<br>No wonder the man hasn't any hair !<br>Swearing is wicked ; smoke's not good ;<br>He smoked and he swore?well, I should think<br>he would.<p>" Thirty years with that tongue so sharp !<br>Oh ! Angel Gabriel! Give him a harp !<br>A jewelled harp with a golden string I<br>Good sir, pass in where the angels sing !<br>Gabriel, give him a seat alone?<br>One with a cushion?up near the throne !<br>Call up some angels to play their best,<br>And let him enjoy the music and rest.<br>See that on the finest ambrosia he feeds,<br>He's had about all the hell he needs.<br>It isn't just hardly the thing to do??<br>To roast him on earth and the future too !"<p>They gave him a harp with golden strings.<br>And he said as he entered the Realm of Day :<br>" Well, this beats cucumbers anyway."<br>And so the Scriptures had come to pass,<br>"The last shall be first, and the first shall be last."<p>Price, 1d.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  To be had from DAVID BAXTER, 32 Brunswick Street, Glasgow,</p>
