	<p> EXECUTION.<p>A Full, Authentic, and Particular Account of the<br>Execution of PETER HAEMAN and FRANCOIS<br>GAUTIEZ, who were Hanged, within, Flood-mark,<br>at Leith, on Wednesday the 9th January, 1822, for<br>the Piratical seizure of the Schooner Jane of Gib-<br>raltar, on her voyage to the Brazils, and for the<br>Barbarous Murder of Thomas Johnston, master, and<br>James Paterson, seaman, whose bodies were after-<br>wards delivered at Edinburgh to be Dissected ; to-<br>gether with their behaviour from the Jail to, and<br>at, the place of Execution.<p>THESE unfortunate men, RETER HEAMAN and FRANCOIS<br>GAUTIEZ, or GAUTIER, who suffered the last penalty of<br>our law this day, were tried, at Edinburgh, before the High Court<br>of Admiralty of Scotland, on Monday the 26th of November last,<br>for the Piratical and unlawful seizure of the Schooner Jane of Gib-<br>raltar, in the Month of June last, when  on her voyage from that<br>place to the Brazils, with a valuable cargo, including specie to the<br>amount of 38,180  Spanish  Dollars;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;for  most  barbarously  and<br>cruelly murdering Thomas Johnston, the Master, and James Pater-<br>son, a seaman  belonging to that Schooner ; and, likewise, for con-<br>fining Peter Smith  and Robot Strachan, seamen, in the forecastle,<br>where, by attempting  to suffocate them by smoke, the murderers<br>succeeded in terrifying the said Smith  and Strachan to assist them<br>in seizing the  vessel, which they afterwards sunk off the coast of<br>Rossshire,  landed the  specie on the Isle of Lewis  in that county,<br>and were soon afterwards made prisoners, and sent to Leith, by Mr<br>M'Ivor, Surveyor of Customs at Stornaway, on the information of<br>Andrew Camelier, a  Maltese  boy belonging to  the said schooner.<br>Their trial attracted the most intense  interest of a crowded court,<br>and lasted till near seven o'clock on Tuesday morning.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They pled<br>Not Guilty, and attempted to exculpate themselves on the allegations<br>that it was the Captain who shot Paterson, and that this was the only<br>shot that was fired : That they all struck at the Captain together,<br>and could not say who it was that killed him : And, that they could<br>not say who it was that proposed to conceal the dollars, but they all<br>assisted in doing so.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They were condemned, notwithstanding these<br>allegations, which  were hot supported by any evidence, on the<br>clearest testimony, and Sentenced to be Executed, within Flood-<br>mark, at Leith, on Wednesday the 9th January 1822, and their bodies<br>to  be delivered to the Professor of Anatomy in the University of<br>Edinburgh for Dissection.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Soon after their condemnation, however,<br>both these unhappy men acknowledged the justice of their sentence,<br>confessing that they alone devised and carried into execution the<br>murder of Captain Johnston and the helmsman Paterson..<p>Gautiez, who was cook on board the schooner, was a Frenchman,<br>a broad thick stout man, apparently about 26 years of ago, and of<br>the Roman  Catholic religion.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Heaman was mate, and was a thin .<br>swarthy man, about 35 years of age, a native of Shields, and of the<br>Church of England persuasion.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He married a Frenchwoman when<br>a prisoner of war in that country, who on the peace, came home<br>with  him,  and who  had four children  to him.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She has a good<br>moral  character, and was in Edinburgh at the time of the trial,<br>with her children, in great distress, where  a small sum was collect-<br>ed for her, among several respectable individuals, including three<br>guineas from the jury, to enable her to proceed home.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They were<br>both very penitent, and paid unremitting, attention to the religious<br>instructions given them from time to time, by the Clergymen and<br>others, who regularly visited them in Jail.<p>Accordingly, on Wednesday the 9th January, 1822, soon after<br>nine o'clock in the morning, a hurdle was drawn up opposite the<br>main door of the Jail, into which the unfortunate men were placed,<br>with their backs to the horse's tail, and facing the executioner, who<br>sat opposite to them, holding the end of a rope, with which they<br>were bound, in his hands. In this manner the cart moved slowly<br>down to Leith, accompanied by the Sheriff, and surrounded with a<br>detachment of Dragoons, Sheriff and Police Officers, &c. where<br>they were received by the Fort Admiral, Clergymen, &c.<p>They arrived at the scaffold, which was erected on the sand op-<br>posite the Royal Naval Yard, about ten o'clock ; and, after spend-<br>ing ten or fifteen minutes in fervent prayer, they mounted the drop,<br>where they shook hands, and again prayed earnestly for a few mi-<br>nutes, when the fatal signal was given, and they were instantly<br>launched into eternity, amidst an immense multitude of spectators.<br>After hanging half an hour, they were cut down, and their bodies<br>sent to Edinburgh in a cart to be dissected, in terins of their sentence.<p>PRICE ONE PENNY.</p>
