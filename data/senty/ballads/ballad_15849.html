	<p> THF ASHES OF NAPOLEON.<p>Attend, you gallant Britons bold, unto these lines I will unfold<br>The deeds of valiant heroes I am going to relate,<br>Who for centuries that is gone by, for England fought most<br>manfully,<br>And in the British records, there you'll find the date.<br>But of a valiant Corsican as ever stood on Europe's land,<br>I am inclined to sing in praise; how noble was his heart,<br>In every battle manfully, he struggled hard for liberty,<br>And to the world a terror was, Napoleon Buonaparte.<p>CHORUS.<br>And now across the foaming waves, to fetch from St. Helena's<br>grave,<br>The proud and gallant Frenchman, so boldly do depart,<br>To bring away, as Britons say, and consecrate without delay,<br>In Paris town, the ashes of Napoleon Buonaparte.<p>We read of gallant Marlborough, we read of valiant Nelson,<br>We read of noble Jarvis, brave Howe, and gallant Blake,<br>Of Wolfe and Abercrombie, great men who fought by land<br>and sea,<br>Back from the days of Wellington, unto Sir Francis Drake;<br>They were men of courage true, and fought like Britons of<br>true blue,<br>Always was undaunted, so noble was each heart,<br>But Europe, we must understand, could not boast of late of<br>such a man,<br>As the valiant little Corsican, Napoleon Buonaparte.<p>When at the Isle of Elba, Napoleon fought for liberty,<br>And when he went across the Alps, he did the world amaze,<br>He would never yield when in the field, but strive to gain a<br>victory,<br>Europe will long remember how Moscow it did blaze;<br>But fatal June at Waterloo, did make Napoleon for to rue,<br>To see the tricks of Blucher, struck terror to his heart.<br>It was then he had to fight or run, he cried, alas! I am undone<br>Like a bullock sold in Smithfield, was Napoleon Buonaparte.<p>It was in the days of Castlereagh, brave Buonaparte was led<br>astray,<br>And the battle of great Waterloo was bought by English gold<br>We long may recollect the day, when Grouchy did the French<br>betray,<br>And brave Napoleon Buonaparte upon the ground was sold.<br>He in the field then valiant stood, saying, while I have life<br>and blood,<br>I will not die a coward (with his hand upon his heart),<br>I always proved myself a man, but now I can no longer stand,<br>My glass is nearly run, cried brave Napoleon Buonaparte.<p>He was by his friends forsaken, and prisoner he was taken,<br>And he was sent to England, just like a convict bound,<br>Far across the briny waves, a gallant soldier bold and brave,<br>On board the Bellerophon man-of-war, to Plymouth Sound;<br>Where he a little time did lay, and thousands flocked by<br>night and day,<br>From here and there, and everywhere, in droves from every<br>part,<br>They were struck with wonder and amaze, as anxiously they<br>on did gaze,<br>That valiant little Corsican, Napoleon Buonaparte.<p>Then soon it was concluded. Napoleon should be banished<br>Unto some distant island, where he no more should smile,<br>And he was sent across the sea, a prisoner for life to be,<br>His days to end in misery on St. Helena's Isle;<br>Louisa for her husband wept, nor day nor night she seldom<br>slept,<br>The briny tears rolled from her eyes to soothe her aching<br>heart,<br>"Where is my Emperor?" she cried, "Oh! cursed be the<br>gold that bribed<br>False Gouchy to betray my brave Napoleon Buonaparte."<p>Some years he lived in exile, and mourned on St. Helena's<br>shore,<br>And there, alas! he was deprived of every bosom friend.<br>He respected was by high and low, through Europe where-<br>soever you go,<br>On the Isle of St. Helena, he there his days did end.<br>He cried, my glass is nearly run, I can behold the setting sun<br>And while he spoke he gently laid his hand upon his heart,<br>He looked around and gave a smile, and died upon St. Hel-<br>ena's Isle,<br>And there they laid the ashes of Napoleon Buonaparte.<p>Now to erect a monument, agreed has every soldier,<br>The Peer, likewise the peasant, every Frenchman bold and<br>brave,<br>And in a very little while they'll bring from St. Helena's Isle,<br>The ashes of Napoleon that lays mouldering in the grave.<br>In the city of great Paris, a tomb will be erected,<br>So splendidly, for to contain his ashes and his heart,<br>And rich and poor that pass that way, will joyfully a tribute<br>pay,<br>To the ashes and the memory of Napoleon Buonaparte.<p>JAMES KAY, GLASGOW.</p>
