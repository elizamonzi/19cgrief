	<p> THE<p>LIBERAL'S CATECHISM,<p>DROPT, AT THE MEETING OF&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;THE&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;FOURTH DISTRICT,<br>ON FRID AY LAST,<p>BY ONE OF THE CLIQUE.<p>Quest.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Are you a candidate for a seat in the Town Council ?<br>Ans.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Yes, I am.<p>Q.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To what party do you belong ?<br>A.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I am a Liberal.<p>Q. Will you have the goodness to explain what you mean by that<br>term ?<br>A. I mean true liberality, which consists in excluding from all power<br>or influence every person whose political sentiments differs in the slightest<p>degree from my own.<p>Q.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But have politics any thing to do with the Town Council ?<br>A. Not much; but it is evident that it would be very disagreeable<br>for Liberals to act along with, or under the inspection of Tories, or even<br>Radicals.<p>Q.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You are of course a man of independent principles ?<br>A. Assuredly. I have been named by a select and exclusive com-<br>mittee, of which I am a member.<p>Q.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pray, what is independence ?<br>A. There are many things goes to constitute true independence; but no<br>one can say he is an independent member of a deliberative body, unless he<br>have previously pledged himself on every question that may come under<br>discussion.<p>Q.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You are then willing to take a pledge ?<br>A.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Any pledge.<p>Q.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What are your views regarding the Annuity Tax ?<br>A. I consider it to be the grand abomination foretold by Daniel, and<br>I shall move " Heaven, earth,and hell" for its total extirpation.<p>Q. What is your opinion about substituting some other tax in its<br>stead, in order to make provision for the Clergy ?<br>A. I am a warm friend to the Established Church, as well as to the<br>eternal principles of justice; and therefore, if the seat rents cannot be<br>secured for the support of the Clergy, I pledge myself to make no com-<br>pulsory assessment " within the Roy-allity" for the present incumbents,<br>and to appoint no successors.<p>Q.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What are your views regarding the Provost's salary ?<br>A. I think the dignity of that office cannot be well maintained upon<br>less than L.40 per annum, being at the rate of L. 10 per quarter; but,<br>being pledged to the strictest economy, if a man can be found who will<br>undertake to perform its duties for less, he shall have my vote. Indeed,<br>in the present state of the City's finances, it may be a question whether<br>it would not be advisable to expose the office to public auction. Perhaps<br>a sum might thus be raised, which would go so far to compensate the<br>Clergy for the loss of the Annuity Tax.<p>Q. Suppose some distinguished stranger, say a foreign prince, were<br>to visit Edinburgh, he might very reasonably expect to be entertained<br>by the Chief Magistrate at his own house?what provision should be<br>made for such an event ?<p>A. I would make no provision; but if the Provost invited the<br>Council to meet his distinguished guest, and would submit to the next<br>meeting a statement of the expenses incurred, I would feel disposed to<br>grant a certain compensation, under deduction of what might reason-<br>ably be supposed to be the ordinary expenses of the Provost's family,<br>and the value of the fragments.<p>Q. Would you accept of any civic place or contract while in the<br>Council ?<p>A. No?that would be mercenary and unworthy an independent<br>Councillor; but were a place to become vacant, I should certainly use<br>my best endeavours to confer it on the most deserving person, and should<br>the Council, by a plurality of votes, fix upon me, I should immediately<br>resign my seat, that the public interest might not suffer by my attention<br>being divided. But as to contracts, as the Council will, in all probability'<br>consist of tradesmen and shopkeepers, I am of opinion, that the most<br>economical plan would be to confine the contracts to Members of<br>Council. This will save much trouble?prevent much bad blood,?and<br>enable the members who has consented to sacrifice so much of their<br>valuable time for the commonweal, to combine private with public<p>business.<p>Q.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In what do you conceive the duties of a Councillor to consist ?<p>A. In " adApting" measures for the removal of the monstrous<br>Annuity Tax, and for reducing the Provost's salary to the lowest possible<br>fraction.<p>Q. Is there nothing else?such as disposing of the City's extensive<br>patronage in the Church and University ?<p>A. I regard all these things as matters with which I, as a Councillor<br>has very little to do. When a vacancy occurs, I would feel disposed to<br>call a public meeting to ascertain the sentiments of my constituents. But<br>for myself, I certainly feel, that the same rule ought to apply to all offices<br>as to the situation of Provost, and that the preference should be given<br>to the person who would do the duties for the smallest remuneration,<br>or who would make the Council the highest offer.<p>Q. Do you think the proceedings of the Town Council ought to be<br>regularly reported ?<p>A.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  Most assuredly.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; How else could our constituents be enabled to<p>judge of our progress in grammar and oratory?<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  Price One Penny.</p>
