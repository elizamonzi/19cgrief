	<p> The Last Speech,<p>Confession and Dying Words, of ROBERT STEWART,<br>late BOOKBINDER in Edinburgh, who was Executed there<br>on Wednesday FEBRU. 22d, 1809, for the Crime of<br>House-breaking and Robbery.<p>I ROBERT STEWART, Bookbinder, aged 20<br>years, was born in the City of Edinburgh, of<br>honest, tho' poor, parents, my Father being but a<br>labouring man ; who was very industrious for the<br>support of his Family ; whose example and advice<br>had I followed, it would have prevented this my<br>unhappy and shameful end.<p>After my parents had given me what education<br>they were able, and brought me up to the years of<br>discretion, I was bound apprentice to the Bookbind-<br>ing business ; and after having served out my ap-<br>prenticeship, I wrought, for some years, as jour-<br>neyman. But my roving disposition, and the un-<br>principled companions with which I took up, led<br>me into some embarasments, which obliged me to <br>engage as a substitute in the Edinburgh Militia; from<br>which I deserted three several times, and at last by<br>the assistance of my friends, procured my discharge.<p>After I left that service, I wrought at my busi-<br>ness for some time ; but falling in with loose and<br>abandoned companions, who led me into all man-<br>ner of debauchery and wickedness. I become care-<br>less about my business, frequented houses, of bad<br>fame, and took up with women of abandoned char-<br>acter : by which conduct I became icsensible to all<br>the good instructions and advices my parents and<br>friends gave me. I was much adicted to night-<br>walking, and gaming, which brought me to an in-<br>difference about every thing that was sacred, giving<br>myself up to sabbath breaking, and delighting in<br>roving and profane company. This course of life,<br>and thereby neglecting my business, brought me<br>into pinching circumstances, and led me to use un-<br>lawful ways to procure money for the support of my<br>extravagant course of life, until at last I fell into<br>that unfortunate-business, of contriving, with the<br>assistance of my brother, to break the Warehouse<br>of Mr, MOIR, in Skinner's Closs, for which I am<br>now most justly to suffer.<p>Soon after the robbery was committed, we were<br>apprehended and examined, and many of the arti-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  <br>cles, of which we had disposed; were recovered and<br>brought to the Council-chamber, in evidence against<br>us. We at first denied the crime, but, by advice,<br>my brothers confessed the whole, and became evi-<br>dences against me for their own safety, for which<br>I sincerely forgive them, as I was the principle in-<br>stigator to committing the crime.<p>It was our misfortune on our trial to plead Not<br>Guilty, as otherwise we might have petitioned for,<br>and obtained banishment. But having had a fair<br>trial, and the crime clearly proven against me ; I<br>humbly submit to my awful sentence, and forgive<br>both Judge and Jury in the execution of their duty.<p>I return my sincere thanks to the Magistrates and<br>Ministers of the City, for their attention to my con-<br>venience and confort during my confinement. I<br>likewise must acknowledge the sympathy, and kind-<br>ness, of many private Christians who have visited<br>and comforted me since I received my sentence. I<br>also return thanks to the Jailor and under turn-keys<br>for their humanity and sympathy to me, while un-<br>der their care.<p>I am happy that my affectionate mother's eyes<br>are closed from seeing my miserable end; and I hope<br>that none will be so cruel as to cast up my untime-<br>ly fate to my surviving parent and relations ; but<br>rather endeavour to avoid the snares which have<br>proved my ruin.<p>And now, O young men, I entreat you to be at-<br>tentive to the good counsils of your parents, and at-<br>tend your lawful employments. Avoid night-wal-<br>king, gaming, drinking, and profane companions,<br>which has proved my ruin, and will inevitable prove<br>the same to all who go on in such kwiced courses.<p>I die in peace with all men, hoping that my mis-<br>erable end will be a warning to all other young per-<br>sons.<p>(Signed,)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ROBERT STEWART</p>
