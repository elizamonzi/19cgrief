	<p> Execution.<p>An Account of the Last Days. Behaviour and<br>Execution of JAMES BRYCE, Labourer,<br>who was Executed here this morning, 3d<br>April, 1844, for the Murder of his Brother-<br>in-Law, John Geddes, at Blaw Wearie, parish<br>of West Calder, on 27th December last.<p>This unhappy man, JAMES BRYCE, suffered the extreme penalty<br>of the law for his crimes of murder and robbery this morning, 3d<br>April, 1844, a little before 9 o'clock, on a Scaffold erected for the<br>purpose, at the head of what was called Libberton's Wynd, now<br>the head of the entrance to the County Hall, west side, nearly<br>facing the head of Bank Street, Edinburgh.<p>The melancholy and degrading circumstances that led to the<br>fatal and ignominious death of this unfortunate man were detailed<br>at great length st his trial, which excited much interest at the time,<br>and which rook place before the High Court of Justiciary, at<br>Edinburgh, on the 12th and 13th days of March last; and<br>though he pled not guilty to the charges, when put to the bar,<br>the chain of evidence adduced against him was so strong and<br>plain, and so clearly, fairly, and forcibly stated by the Solicitor-<br>General, that the Jury, after the most anxious and mature delibera-<br>tion, unanimously found him guilty ; and that, too, notwithstand-<br>ing a long, brilliant, and most ingenious speech addressed to them<br>on his behalf by his counsel, Mr Crawford, for which he was com-<br>plimented from the bench.<p>Soon after his condemnation, however, it is certainly satisfactory<br>to record, that he confessed his guilt freely, fully, and willingly,<br>notwithstanding his gloomy, sullen, and taciturn appearance and<br>conduct at his trial. Indeed the Lord Justice Clerk's solemn ad-<br>dress, at passing sentence, must have made a very serious and deep<br>impression on him. After stating that by the verdict returned, and<br>the sentence which the law annexed to the fearful crime of which<br>he had been found guilty, his Lordship emphatically said, " your<br>days are numbered?the hours are numbered which you are to re-<br>main in this world. It is for you, then, to think what is to follow<br>the execution of this sentence?the announcement of which ought<br>to shut out for ever from you all thoughts of this world. You will<br>pass, after a space which your sentence specifies, into the presence<br>of Almighty God?into the presence of that Great Being who can<br>destroy, not the body only, but the soul, and from whose unerring<br>justice the punishment due to guilt?to unrepented guilt?must<br>follow after you appear at His judgment seat. I exhort you not to<br>turn your mind away from the atrocity of the guilt with which you<br>stand charged ; but on the contrary, by dwelling upon that, to<br>bring your mind into that state of abasement, and contrition, and<br>penitence, by which alone you can be brought to implore mercy<br>through the merits of the blessed Redeemer. You will be assisted,<br>I doubt not, by able clergymen, who will direct you in this way,<br>who will strive to produce an impression of divine truths on your<br>soul ; yield yourself willingly and submissively to their instruction.<br>Do not delude yourself with false hopes of mercy here. With them<br>and by yourself implore the mercy of God through faith in that<br>blessed Redeemer, whose atonement alone can pardon the sinner."<p>After this solemn admonition, working on a convicted conscience,<br>Bryce soon became penitent, and acknowledged the justice of his<br>sentence. He was regularly attended by the City clergy, as well as<br>by the Chaplain, who were unremitting in their attentions to him.<br>Within the last few days several friends waited upon him, who ap<br>peared quite satisfied with his conduct and behaviour. Indeed, he<br>appeared perfectly penitent and resigned to his fate. Late on Tues-<br>day night he was brought over from the Jail, and lodged in the<br>Lock-up, where he slept several hours, occasionally starting and<br>moaning. This morning he was early waited upon by two clergy-<br>men and the officiating magistrates, and, after singing and praying<br>for a short time in the hall, he appeared on the scaffold soon after<br>eight, decently dressed and apparently quite resigned to his fate.<br>A few minutes being spent in prayer and praise, he was, assisated up<br>to the fatal drop, where he was observed solemnly praying, when<br>he threw the handkerchief?the drop fell?and he ceased to exist.</p>
