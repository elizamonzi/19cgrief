This, it<br>is said,  is the result of instructions from  Mr. Peel to the<br>local authorities. The justice of the country would have<br>been wofully disgraced by  any attempt to stifle inquiry<br>into these horrid proceedings, whomsover it may affect.-<br>Sheffield Iris-<p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  THE<p>WEST PORT MURDERS.<p>No trial in the memory of any man now living, has  excited so<br>deep, universal, and appalling an interest as that of William Burke<br>and his female associate. Public anticipation was greatly excited<br>previous to the trial ; but we believe the atrocities disclosed in<br>court, have more than realized the most romantic speculations. A<br>more frightful instance of human turpitude never perhaps was de-<br>tected among a Christian people.<p>The intense interest which has been so universally created in<br>the public mind, has induced the publisher to endeavour to afford<br>all the gratification that a  comlete and authentic accoont of the <br>horrible crimes can afford.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; From the information (hitherto un-<br>puliced) which has been already received, as well as that which<br>has been promised, he is  enabled to announce that pulication<br>will contain full and authentic  particulars of all the circumstances<br>connected with these most  atrocious murders, from the discovery<br>till the final termination of  the proceedings; and from the eminent<br>literary qualifications of the gentleman who superintends the pub-<br>lication, possessing the very best means of obtaining intelligence, <br>as well as the valuable assistance derived from other sources, he<br>confidently anticipates that this account will be found as accurate<br>and complete as any that can be furnished.<p>It will be published in numbers in rapid succession, embellished<br>with portraits drawn from Life, and other highly interesting en-<br>gravings of Plans, &c., and will include every circumstance that<br>may afterwards transpire, with an account of the Execution, &c.<p>No. 1, contains an Engraving of Burke's House.<p>? 3, will contain a correct Portrait of Burke, taken during the<br>trial by an eminent artist.<p>? 5, will contain a Portrait of Hare.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<p>In the course of publication, the following engravings will be<br>given?Portrait of Burke's wife?Portrait of Hare's wife, both<br>taken during the trial?The Plan of Burke's House produced in<br>the trial, and several other Plates.</p>
