	<h2>Transcription</h2>
	<p> Impresssive Prayer ascribed, as de-<br>livered by James Campbell, to his fellow-convicts, before<br>their leaving Glasgow Jail, on Wednseday morning 20th<br>Novr., 1822.<p>The following impressive prayer, is ascribed to be the one<br>offered up by a person w ho had nearly forfeited his life to<br>the laws. That James Campbell offered up an earnest and<br>impressive prayer for the temporal reformation and eternal<br>welfare of his fellow convicts, on Wednesday morning, last,<br>the 20th Novr. previous to their being taken from this city,<br>in fulfillment of their sentence, and which prayer came from<br>the lips of the above named person, while assembled in an<br>appartment in the Jail, in the presence of the Revd. Mr,<br>Morrison, and other worthy men, is stated in the Glasgow<br>Public Papers, this week; and as the affeeting scene alluded<br>to called forth the tears of the by-standers, it is to be hoped<br>the impressions on that morning, will not be soon forgotten.<p>PRAYER.<p>" O Thou, thou that dwellest in the heavens, and readest the .<br>thoughts of our hearts, we approach thee in fear and tremb-<br>ling. Though we may atone for our offence to the mild<br>laws of our country, how shall we atone for our offences to<br>thee! We feel that  thou art merciful, yet just; and in the<br>cave, in the wilderness, and in the deep sea, thou wilt find<br>us out. Teach us, 0 God, to seek thy footsteps; thou hast said, wherever<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;two or three are met together in thy name, there will thou be in the midst<br>of them ; and though all the world cast us off, thou wilt still be the refuge<br>and friend of the outcast. We whom thou foundst in the cradle, when<br>our parents' arms strained us to their bosom, wilt not desert us when the<br>fetter binds us, or  the chain lays us prostrate on the earth. Teach us,<br>O God, how to find thee, wen deserted of every friend but thee; let us<br>trace thy footsteps on the hills, amid the rolling thunder; let us hear thy<br>voice  amid the storm; let us find thee among  the rocks; let us see thy<br>face in the pit and the dungeon; let us see thee as a God, whose commiser-<br>ation is not only to be excited by the hurricane and the voicano, but still<br>as the God of the stranger, to whom, the appeal of his creatures lowers<br>above the tempest, and is heard louder than the storm !<p>Grant us length of days, O God, that we may be enabled to repent and<br>endeavour to atone for the evils in our past life; and when old age may at<br>length oertake us, when no tender friend is near, grant that our death<br>may be to thy glory. And should one penitent tear bedew our cheek; <br>when in manhood death may assail us, in a distant country, it will be a beam<br>will light the outcast to his grave, and the last that his weary feet wanted.<p>Help us, O God, and support us under our suffering , and soften the<br>kardened heart; do not destroy us should there be found, already, even<br>one or two contrite hearts. And should it please thee, that those who<br>now leave their native country, and those are left, shall never all meet<br>again on earth.?then, when the great tribunal shall be hold?when the<br>sun shall rise, to arise no more?when the moon and the stars are falling?<br>when Judges must appear to be tried themselves?may they be untainted<br>and acquitted, through their Redeemer's sake, Amen."<p>Mayne & Co, Printers, Glasgow.<p></p>
