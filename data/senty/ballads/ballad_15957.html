	<p> CURIO US<p>CASE !<p>A Full and Particular Account of that Curious and<br>Laughable circumstance, that took place between<br>a journeyman Hatter and a sprightly young lass, on<br>Monday, the 4th July, 1825 ; with an Account of<br>the Lass's adventures in the Lad's Bed-Room, to-<br>gether with what took place on her detection, and<br>being brought before a Magistrate, and the advice<br>given by his Honour to the Docter in attendance<br>in order to produce oboration, so that what she<br>illegally took in the Bed-Room might then be re-<br>stored to its proper owner.<p>A woman of the town, named Ellen Newman, was on Tuesday<br>brought before Mr Chambers, the Magistrate, charged with<br>robing a journeyman hatter of eleven sovereigns, three of which<br>she managed to swallow previous to her apprehension.<p>Joseph Alder, the complainer, stated, that he resides in Mint-<br>Street, Southwark; that on the preceding night he went home be-<br>tween twelve and one o'clock, opened the street door, which re-<br>mains ajar throughout the night, left it in that situation, and enter-<br>ed his own bed-room, the door of which he left unbolted, contrary<br>to his usual custom, and retired to bed. In about an hour after-<br>wards he was aroused from his slumbers by feeling the cold hand<br>of somebody on his face ; he raised himself up in the bed, caught<br>fast hold of the intruder's hand, asking in God's name, who was<br>there ? A female voice answered, " It's me, my dear; I am come<br>to go to bed with you, for I have been locked out, and must walk<br>the streets, if you don't let me come in." From the gentle accents<br>of the supplicant, and being in total darkness, the hatter said, he<br>verily believed at the time that she was some poor servant girl, who<br>had been shut out, and, commiserating her situation, he permitted<br>her to take share of his bed. Having soon fallen asleep again, he<br>was disturbed a second time, but hearing some one creeping about<br>the room; he felt for his companion, and found she was gone,<br>upon which he hastilygot up, and, while poking about in the dark,<br>he heard his room-door open and some one rush out. He follow-<br>ed, undressed; the person whom he was in chase of reached the<br>street. and darted of at full speed, he was under the necessity of<br>following, naked as he was, and the rain pouring down,at the time.<br>Fortunately, however, he succeeded in coming up with the thief, in<br>the person of his female acquantance. In the course of her career<br>she had dropped several of his garments, and when secured, the<br>coat, waisooat, hat, stockings, and shoes of the hatter, were found<br>in her possession.<p>When she was taken to the watchouse, she refused to speak, or<br>give any account of herself; but on the hatter discovering that she<br>had also stolen 11 sovereigns out of a tea-caddy, her hands were<br>tied behind her, when she dropped eight of the sovereigns oat of<br>her mouth, and swallowed the other three, saying, " she had done<br>them after all." The Magistrate directed the docter of the gaol to<br>administer her a strong dose of physic for the benefit of her health<br>and also for the purpose of restoring the gold to its owner.</p>
