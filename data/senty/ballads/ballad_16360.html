	<p> A STUMP SPEECH.<p>This  Popular Slump Speech can always be had at the<br>Poet's  Box.<p>FRIENDS AND FELLOW-CITIZENS,-Unaccustomed as I um to<br>public speaking, allow me to say that when a man stands be-<br>fore a number of his fellow-men to speak, he assumes a<br>liberty; and the liberty I am about to assume is to stand be- <br>fore you to undress the whole lot of you (eh). When we refer<br>to Glasgow, one of the largest provincial towns in Great<br>Britain, what did Mr Graham the Member of Parliament say<br>(eh)? Didn't he say the rising population of the Saltmarket<br>ought to be franchised, for when a young man arrives at the<br>age of 18 his first step in life is to get his life insured. Go<br>down to the insurance office, and the first question they say<br>to him is-what are you, a male or a female? and how long<br>have you been so (eh)? These things must be seen into, for<br>when we refer to Glasgow Green, Julius Cesar tells us there<br>is a legend attached to that spot, for in the year 55, X Y W<br>and G, a gentleman having two sons, both boys, aged re-<br>spectively 17 and 32, and being twins, the sister dies, and<br>being orphans, the father tells them by his bedside that they<br>are liable to be indicted for not being vaccinated. Well, is<br>that any reason the flesher shouldn't have their cattle<br>vaccinated (eh)? Of course we all know the old saying,<br>England is the richest power in the world; and why? if she<br>aint got money we have lots of tick. Didn't Princess Mary<br>of Cambridge have a little baby by Teck (eh)? But we all<br>know when a great statesman dies, they always have a fine<br>tombstone in commemoration of his memory; but there's one<br>man who will never want a tombstone, and why? because<br>his name will always be a "Livingstone." We all know<br>some philosophers say the world revolves round on its own<br>axletrees; then the question arises, who first discovered the<br>world? Why, Spurgeon! Then the next question is-Who<br>were our first forefathers and foremothers? Adam and Eve-<br>man and wife (eh)? Who married them? why, Dr. Cumming.<br>Then who was the first women known to man? Why, Adam<br>was; and why? wasn't he the first maid (eh)? When we<br>refer to Ireland, the cry is how shall England put down the<br>Fenians? Why, send them good music. Don't Burns the<br>Scotch Poet say " Scotland, dear Scotland, the land of song."<br>England for her national airs, Ireland for simple ballads.<br>But England's been trying to cultivate the Irish to sing;<br>they want them to sing one song, and what song is it? why,<br>"Come back, Stephens," (eh)? Of course, the cattle plague<br>has gone by. The cry was last year the poor people couldn't<br>afford the price of good meat, and the remedy was fish; and<br>where did it come from? Scotland is noted for salmon,<br>Ireland is noted for herring; that's why they say "Erin-go-<br>bragh;" but there's one fish in Ireland England can't relish,<br>and what fish is it? Why, the "Irish Pike." When we<br>refer to reform, the question is-how are we to franchise the<br>over-population of Glasgow? for some people have too many<br>children, others have none at all, especially the ladies be-<br>longing to the upper ten thousand, for they are advertising<br>daily for children to adopt. But they need not go far; let<br>them go to their wholesale grocers and there they will see<br>outside their doors " families supplied on the shortest notice."<br>Now, the only thing is, don't eat too many oysters, for<br>Gladstone had the nightmare. He's had a dream, and in it<br>he says:-<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How doth the little busy bee<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Improve each shining hour,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Come down upon our butcher meat,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And turn the whole lot sour.<p>CURE FOR A CRIPPLE.<p>This Popular Reading can always be had at the Poet's Box.<p>IT happened on a Sunday evening, about thirty years<br>ago, that two sheep-stealers had meditated all attempt<br>on the flock of a wealthy farmer in the parish of A--<br>in the west neuk of Fife. The sheep were grazing in<br>a park adjoining the village churchyard and hard by<br>the public road. The eldest and most experienced of<br>the depredators recommended that only one of them<br>should go in among the sheep, as it would not alarm<br>them so much as two. Accordingly the younger thief<br>was despatched to bring a sheep, while the other went<br>into the churchyard, and sat down upon a through-<br>stone to amuse himself till his companion returned.<p>Now it so happened that John, the minister's man,<br>had forgot to take home the Bible from the church,<br>after the service of the day was over, which neglect<br>was not perceived until the minister called for the<br>books to perform the duty of family worship, when<br>John was immediately sent to the church for the bible.<br>John not being possessed of a very daring spirit, and<br>it being a dark winter night, was not very fond of<br>visiting the abodes of the dead at such an hour; but<br>when he arrived at the church-yard gate, and got a<br>glimpse of the man sitting on the through-stone, his<br>hair stood on end, and his fears soon conjured the<br>thief into a demon. Without more ado he wheeled<br>about, and made the best of his way to the manse,<br>where he related his wonderful story, telling them that<br>he saw the devil sitting on a grave breaking dead bones.<p>An old cripple mendicant, who was quartered at the<br>manse during the Sabbath (for the minister, contrary<br>to the general character of his brethren, was a very<br>charitable man), hearing John tell his appalling story,<br>laughed at him, saying, " if I was as able to gang as<br>you, I would soon bring the Bible."<p>" Well," says John, " if you will accompany me, I<br>will carry yon on my back, and we'll maybe be able<br>to bring the Bible atween us."<p>The beggar agreed, and mounted John accordingly,<br>after he had wrapped himself in his grey plaid. When<br>they came within view of the thief, John would very<br>fain have turned, but the beggar spurred him on, until<br>they came within a short distance of him, when he,<br>supposing it to be his comrade coming with the sheep<br>on his back, exclaimed, " Is he a fat ane ?<p>John, whose heart was quaking before, on hearing<br>this question put to him, could no longer resist his in-<br>clination to turn ; he threw the old man off his back,<br>saying, " be he fat or be he lean, there he is to ye,"<br>and run what he was able.<p>The mendicant, finding that he was thus left to his<br>own resources to appease the devil as he could, mustered<br>all his strength ; and, strange to tell, his legs that had<br>refused to perform their office for many a long year<br>before, were suddenly strengthened; he soon went<br>past John, regained the manse before him, and was<br>never lame after.</p>
