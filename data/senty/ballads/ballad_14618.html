	<p> BATTLE<p>BETWEEN<p>Simon Byrne<p>AND<p>DEAF BURKE<p><p>A Full, True, and Particular Account of that most Desperate and<br>Well Fought BATTLE which took place between SAM BYRNE<br>and DEAF BURKE, on Thursday last, 150 miles on this side of<br>London upon the Great North Road, for L.150 a side,?when Deaf<br>Burke was declared Champion, after a desperate battle of 27 rounds,<br>which lasted one hour and fifteen minutes.<p>This long-appointed battle took place on Thursday last, about 150<br>miles from London upon the Great North Road, ana was attended by<br>all the principal amateurs of the London Ring, and came happily off<br>without the interference of the beaks. Heavy bets were laid on both<br>sides, and thousands were lost and won upon the occasion,?the odds, if<br>any, being in favour of Burke. Both men had been in active train-<br>ing ; they seemed to be in high spirits, and appeared to have been in<br>good keeping. Byrne weighed 9 stone 10 lbs., Burke 9 stone 2 lbs.<p>At the. time appointed, the combatants entered the ring, accompanied<br>by their seconds and bottle-holders, each uncovering themselves, and<br>throwing their castors in the air, amid the shouts of the spectators, and,<br>after shaking mawleys, took their positions, and prepared for action.<p>Round 1. Both men displayed great science. After some excellent<br>sparring, Byrne was floored by a left handed blow on the listener.<p>Rounds 2 and 3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Byrne slipped from the heavy hits of his opponent.<p>Round 4. Good fighting: Burke jobbed cleverly, and threw down<br>his man, after having stood his ground well for five minutes.<p>Round 5. Severe exchanges right and left Byrne caught an un-<br>lucky hit on the potatoe-trap, which brought him to the ground.<p>Round 6. Burke hit Byrne a left bander on the dexter ogle, which<br>made it blush like a full blown rose, and threw down his man.<p>Rounds 7, 8, and 9. Lively work; tiddey tipping on both sides; and<br>game shewn to the entire approbation of the fancy.<p>Round 10. Both to work at close in-fighting. Burke lending a hit<br>at Byrne's victualling-shop, had it returned on his bread-basket; but on<br>coming to close fight, Byrne slipped down.<p>Rounds 11 to 14&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  Byre down, mostly slipping.<p>Round 15 Counter jobbing. Byrne's pepper-box shewed occular<br>demonstration of heavy work from his adversary, who floored him at<br>full length by a heavy left hander on the bread-basket.<p>Rounds 16 and 17. Good fighting. Burke jobbed cleverly, throwing<br>down his man. Byrne seemingly getting weak.<p>Round 18. Sparring for wind, displaying great caution. Byrne<br>floored his man by a right hander on the listener.<p>Rounds 19 to 22. Light fighting and slight hits from both parties.<br>All in favour of Burke, who kept his ground well, without shewing<br>many marks of heavy punishment, except on one of his peepers.<p>Round 23. Burke lent Byrne a tremendous blow on the mug, which<br>now began to look rather queer.<p>Round 24. All in favour of Burke, who was now tremendously<br>cheered. The betting high in his favour.<p>Round 25. Byrne made a desperate effort to turn the day ; and,<br>going in wildly, struck right. He was met nobly by Burke, who stopt<br>his thrusts, and lent him on the smeller, which sent him down.<p>Rounds 26 and 27. All in favour of Burke. Byrne had no chance ;<br>he was most desperately punished,?but again came up to the scratch.<p>Round 28. Byrne could scarcely stand on his pegs ; but, pluck to<br>the last, aimed a hit at Burke's pepper-box, but missed, and received<br>a counter hit on his potatoe trap, when he fell into the arms of his<br>seconds, completely exhausted.<p>Edinburgh,?Printed for Francis M'Cartney.<p>.</p>
