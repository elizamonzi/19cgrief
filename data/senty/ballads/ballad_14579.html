	<p> Alarming  Riot.<p>A full and particular Account of that most alarming<br>RIOT at Wick Caithness Shire, in consequence<br>of Cholera having appeared there on Thursday<br>last, the 26th July, against Dr Allison of this city,<br>who was in imminent danger of his life, and  had to<br>leave the place.<p>We copy the following from the Courant of Saturday last, and are<br>sorry for the occurrence of the circumstances, in cosequence of<br>the false and vague reports and insinuations made  of on the<br>occassion :....<p>" We are sorry to state that two cases of decided cholera occurred<br>on Thursday week, in  the same family, at  Wick, where several<br>thousand strangers from all parts of Scotland and foreign countries<br>resort at this seeson for the purpose of prosecuting the herring fish-<br>ing.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Both cases, which were of the most malignant character, un-<br>fortunatly  terminated fatally in  a  Very short time.  <p>  Until&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the strangers arrived,  the medical gentleman (Dr E. D. Allison, from<p>Edinburgh), who had charge of the hospital, &c. at Wick, appeared<br>to have secured the confidence of all classes  of the inhabitants in<br>the. arrangements which he proposed and carried into effect, in the<br>prospect of an  attack  of the cholera.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This, however, was much<br>shaken when the fishermen arrived from Mussel burgh, Fisherrow,<br>Dunbar, &c. who related to the inhabitants frightful stories about<br>the number of persons, their friends and neighbours, who had been<br>poisoned, some of whom had  been buried alived, and  that all the<br>patients whom Dr Allison had attended had died ; and foretold, that<br>if he remained much longer, that he would play the same tricks to<br>them likewise, as he was sent down for no other purpose than pro-<br>curing fifty subjects every week for Edinburgh  College.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It was<br>confidently asserted, too, that twelve dozen of coffins  were ready ;<br>and that Dr A. had engaged,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;that if he once got a patient into the<br>hospital, he would take good care that they would not come out a-<br>gain alive.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The circumstance of the first case having terminated<br>fatally with groat rapidity, and after an exhibition of some medicine,<br>appeared to confirm these grassly  unfounded  stories.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The cases<br>were alleged net to be cholera  and  Er A, was immediately charged<br>with the murder of the patients?with poisoning all the public<br>wells, which were forsaken.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Crowds, mostly composed of south<br>country fishermen, soon collected  around the quarntine hospital,<br>which was getting ready to receive the survivin ginfected  family,<br>and were harangued in the most violent manner by several of their<br>number.  Dr A. in vain assured the mob that he was innocent of<br> the crimes imputed to him; that he had never attended any person<br>at the towns above mentioned, and that all  the other charges was<br> unfounded ; but he was answered with the  most fearful impreca- .<br> tions and threaning language, horrid yells, and cries of " Murder<br>him--off with the murderer ! " &c.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A ruffian made an attempt to<br>knock him down, but the  Chairman of the Board of Health pro-<br>tected him, and indoing so  became the  object of the fury of the<br>mob, from whom he was rescued with dfficulty,  whilst Dr A. after<br>taking refuge in a house, was attended to his lodgings by one of the<br>magistrates.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the meantime, the mob, now amounting to 1590,<br>ordered the few contents of the quarantine hospital&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to be instantly<br>removed on a cart, and then safely lodged in the cholera hospital.<br>Large bodies of special constables patroled during the night near<br>the Chairman's and Dr A.'s residence,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As Dr A. found the people<br>not only determined to oppose him in all his measures, but threat-<br>ened his life, he therefore conceived it to be vain to anticipate future<br>usefulness, and immediately resigned his duties, which the Board<br>found, tor the same reasons, absolutely necessary to accept, as be-<br>ing the only  means for calming the fury of the populaee.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A few<br>panes of glass in the cholera hospital were broken in the riot, and<br>two of the most violent rioters were apprehended, but they were<br>liberated next day.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Several members of the Board waited in the<br>hotel and saw Dr A. depart safely with the mail for Edinburg, with<br>warm expressions of respect and regret.<p>Edinburgh: Printed for John Lyons.?Price One Penny.</p>
