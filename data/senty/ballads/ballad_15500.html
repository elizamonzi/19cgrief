	<p> DREADFUL&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>AND AWFUL<p>RIOTS<p>IN<p> PARIS!<p><br>A Full and Particular Account of the Dreadful and Awful<br>Riots in Paris, (occasioned by the Anniversary of the Mur-<br>der of the Duke de Berri,) by the friends of Charles the<br>Tenth, now at Holyroodhouse,?With an account of the<br>Destruction of the Catholic Archbishop's Palace, and of<br>his Arrest, also an account of the capture of several of the<br>Ringleaders.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<p>Yesterday morning, at eleven o'clock, about two hundred<br>persons went to the church of St Germain&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;l'Auxerrois, to at-<br>tend a commemoration service performed for the late Duke<br>of Berry. The rector of the parish officiated. An officer<br>who wore the insignia of several orders, took, from his coat<br>the cross of the order of St Louis, and attached it to the pall,<br>as did another officer the cross of the Legion of Honour.<p>Among the persons present were a pupil of the school of<br>St Cyr in uniform, and three national guards, one of whom<br>was named Valerius. A rumour having got abroad that the<br>bust of the Duke of Bordeaux had been crowned under the<br>title of Henry the Fifth, a crowd proceeded to the church, and<br>a disturbance being apprehended, the national guards on duty<br>at head-quarters, hastened to the spot By order of the com-<br>missary, the three nttional guards were arrested, and conduc-<br>ted to the office.<p>Valerius&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;publicly&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;declared&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;that&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Henry&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; V.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;was&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; his <br>Sovereign, and his wife exclaimed, " We must not surrender,<br>but must conquer or die."<p>By this time all Paris was in arms; and the Archbishop<br>of Paris being considered as the principal cause of the dis-<br>graceful proceedings at the ceremony, the wrath of the po-<br>pulace was levelled at him, his pala e was gutted and plunder-<br>ed, and every church in the city more or less damaged. So<br>complete was the destruction at the at the Archbishop's<br>palace, that the river Seine was covered with books, and<br>furniture of every description, which was thrown from his<br>window. It is strange that this took place on the day that<br>a report was circulated in Edinburgh that an express had<br>reached the Ex-King at Holyroodhouse that the King of<br>France had been assassinated.<p>Some individuals persisted in throwing stones at the church<br>of Notre Dame, insisting that some of the obnoxious Priests<br>were there.<p>The Archbishop, and a number of the ringleaders, have<br>been taken into custody.<p>The most awful alarm prevails throughout all Paris, and<br>great fears are entertained for the public safety.<p>John Campbell, Printer, Edinburgh.</p>
