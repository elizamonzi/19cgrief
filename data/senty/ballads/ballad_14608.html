	<h2>Transcription</h2>
	<p> Account of that Destructive Calamity<br>which occured at the Broomielaw on<br>Tuesday evening, When the ice broke<br>the Mooring to which the vessels were<br>attached, and about forty vessels were<br>sent adrift runnirig and knocking each<br>other to pieces, and a number went<br>down.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The number of lives lost has<br>not been ascertained Such a calamity<br>never before occurred in the River Clyde.<p>(From the Glasgow Free Press of this day).<p>GLASGOW, 9th feb. 1831.<p>Our harbour, was yesterday, the scene of one of the most de-<br>structive and fatal occurrences, we fear, that has ever been wit-<br>neseed in this part of the country. Ahout half-past four o'clock,<br>P. M. the floating ice in the river had accumulated to such an ex-<br>tent against the upper tier of Vessels moored at the south side of<br>the river, as to break the iron pail to which they had been faste-<br>ed, and the strength of the current bearing them towards the cen-.<br>tre of the stream, the whole of the shipping on that side of the.<br>river were speedlly set adrift, together with nearly an equal num-<br>ber, with which they came in colision, on the opposite side of the<br>river. The rapid state of the stream, and the unexpected nature<br>of the event, rendered the joint exertions of Mr Johnston, the<br>Harbour-Master, and the united efforts of the crews of the ship<br>ping almost entirely., futile in .preventing damage. The floating<br>shipping quickly drifted past, the quay, sinking or taking with it<br>rafts of timber, boats, and every obstacle opposing its progress.<br>A gentleman, who arrived at the quay at a late hour last night,<br>informs us that the river from the Broomielaw, as far as Cart, a<br>distance of about seven miles, was covered with floating wreck.-<br>The following  essels, we are informed, are among the number<br>that were adrift:?George sloop, of Greenock, Campbell, master.<br>Janet, lighter, of do. Baxter?Lady Margaret, sloop of do. Leitch.<br>Mary, do. of Glasgow,.M'Kinlay?Columbus, schooner, of ditto,<br>Howison, with loss of mast and windlass?Vigilant, brig, belong-<br>ing to Grangemouth?Mary Graham ; schooner, of Airth, Cowan,<br>Hug'h Crawford, smack, of Greenock?James, gabert, of ditto,<br>M'Intyre?Margaret and Grizzel, do, of do.? Ann, ditto of ditto,<br>M'Kurrach?Royal Oak, do. of Dumbarton?Friends, schooner,<br>of Stromness?Mary, sloop, of Alloa?Neptune, smack, of Liver-<br>pool?Samson, sloop, of Greenock?-Margaret lighter, Greenock,<br>Margaret, lighter, do. Campbell?Leven, do. Glasgow?Christian,<br>sloop, Greenock, M'Arthur, with her stern stove in?Runcorn,<br>schooner,Chester, with windlass and chain broken?Galston and<br>irvine, brig, Troon, was brought up with some damage, STEAM<br>BOATS?The Argyle?Countess of Glasgow?Highland Chieftain.<br>Sultan?Ben-Nevis?Maid of Islay. The following vessels are<br>sunk:--James, sloop, Greenock, Smith?Elizabeth,smack, Camp-<br>belton, sunk and dismasted at the Quay, cargo discharging?He-<br>len, smack, Greenock, with a general cargo, upset-?James, schoo-<br>ner strangford, loaded with coals, outward bound, went down<br>near the Slip Dock?A Highland wherry. The total number of<br>vessels sunk and adrift is said to be about 40. We have been un-<br>able to ascertain how many  lives, if any, were lost, as no names<br>nor any  particulars were authenticated last night, except that it<br>was currently reported that part of the crew of the James schoo-<br>ner had been .drowned.<p>The damage done must have been very extensive, as a great<br>quantity of goods have been lost, independent of the damage done<br>to the veesels. The channel, which is so confined, vessels now<br> lying on both sides, was the principal cause of so much destruc-<br>tion taking place, as they could not keep clear of each other.<p>The thaw still continues, and the inhabitants of Bridgegate and<br>some of the closses in the Saltmarket, were roused from their<br>slumber, by the approach of the watery element, and had to make<br>their escape for their lives, A number of cattle were extricated <br>from their perilous situation; and driven to places of security. It<br>was lamentable to see some of the persons who made their escape<br>from this scene of danger, cold, wet and houseless, not knowing<br>where to find an asylum. It was lucky for them, though the night<br>was wet, that the air was very moderate.<p>Wm. Carse, Printer.</p>
