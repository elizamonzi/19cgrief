Dear contributors,
 
I've listed below the contributors to the NCMR special issue on the digital humanities, along with the titles of the articles. After hearing from everyone, I'm revising the deadline to receive your article to June 30; I hope this will be convenient. As I study the completed articles there is a possibility that I will have follow up questions or suggested changes; once all of these have been made the entire issue will be forwarded to the journal for peer review.
 
 Inga Stanković, (Re)constructing Early Recordings: Understanding Mechanical Recording Processes Through the Use of Contemporary Digital Technologies 
Eric Clarke and Cayenna Ponchione-Bailey, Digital Methods in the Study of the Nineteenth-Century Orchestra 
John Rink, Music in the Balance: The Performance of Digital Editions 
Elizabeth Monzingo, Daniel Shanahan and David Huron, The Expression of Grief in the Nineteenth Century: An Analysis Through Distant Readings
Sarah Fuchs Sampson, Visualizing the “Voix naturelle”
José Manuel Izquierdo König  and Fernanda Vera Malhue, Rethinking Nineteenth-Century Salon Music in Chile: a digital perspective
 
Please do not hesitate to contact me if I can be of any assistance; also, I would be most grateful if you let me know immediately if your situation changes such that the June deadline becomes problematic.
 
I look forward to working with you,
Heather
